iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Ernest Grewe	1	In weak mobile network reception unusable!	2016-12-26	de	My wife has been using an iPhone 3GS so far and was very happy with it. After a few days of falling, the disc splintered, I thought it was time to treat her to a new smartphone. After a short discussion about the requirement profile, we decided on the iPhone 7, because according to various tests and user opinions it should have a better reception than the 5 or 6. (We can judge the comparatively bad reception performance of these devices quite well, since I have only the 5 and now use the 6) The delivery was Amazon-typical fast and easy, the look and feel of the new iPhone is perfect, the installation - as Apple usual - unproblematic and schnell.Aber then unfortunately the disillusionment came. We live on the Land and have gotten used to having a less than optimal network reception (whether D1, D2 ...). With the 3GS, my wife was able to make calls anywhere in the house and on the property without problems, with the new 7 Series this was no longer possible. Either looking for a position on the window, then there not move as possible or renounce on the phone ... both are not really useful alternative, if you have to use the phone for work almost continuously. Since my wife is also traveling a lot in rural areas, so anyway often has to struggle with weak network coverage, the iPhone 7 is unfortunately unusable for their purpose of use. What good is the ease of setup, the trouble-free networking with Outlook, the appointment coordination in the company or other gimmicks, if the rudimentary basic functions are not usable? For me it is incomprehensible that Apple does not manage it over device generations to get back an acceptable reception performance. Other manufacturers have the issue under control better and it just annoying when everyone around one can easily make phone calls or send messages and you sit with his noble phone on the dry ... Since phone in my opinion, still the essential function of a basic Is mobile phones, I can not award more than a star despite all the other positive features of this device, especially since Apple apparently this problem does not take seriously for years seriously! The iPhone 7 goes back to Amazon and the old 3 Series is repaired.	0

However, there are two things that bother me enormously at this price. The speakers are the worst I've ever heard, they can play very loudly, but the sound quality is subterranean, the high notes are too overpresent and drown out the overall very thin sound spectrum, even the s9 felt more "bass" "2. The system performance leaves something to be desired. Noticeable in many situations are micro-stutters that should never exist at such a price.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Miriam Gratelvus	3	Great product, but ghost seller.	2018-10-02	it	On the iPhone I have nothing to say, but unfortunately I told the seller that at the time of delivery I wanted the receipt for any problem and in any case a guarantee. The seller didn't send me anything, but after my reports he sent me a photo of a receipt with that price of course null. So on the product they send 5 stars because Apple has always been Excellence For me, while the ghost seller gives me practically a star. In fact I don't know how to balance the review. This time Amazon downloads the barrel to the seller who, as I have already said, is absent. So if you want to buy, take into account that despite the fact that by law there are two years of warranty, this product is only one year with Apple because the second year given by the seller does not exist. Fortunately I still had no problems.	0

Actually, the iPhone looked visually very good even after delivery. Due to a display break, the device had to be repaired shortly afterwards. Hereby it turned out that a cheap battery was installed. Well, OKSchlimmer is, however, that the seal was completely missing. Furthermore, various screws were loose in the device, a screw was not tightened and slid inside the case back and forth, which would have led to prolonged use quickly to a board damage. My daughter found in the headphones a used chewing gum! All this was in the "general overhaul" ignored, speak it was dilettantisch worked, the main thing is optics.	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Gary B	1	Defective out of the box	2019-02-26	us	I purchased this xs to replace my 6 plus. Once I got it home, I noticed it would not hook up to cellular data. I also noticed that I had to swipe it two or three times or more to get it to open up. The facial recognition was very slow and sometimes wanted the pass code entered.  When I went to reset it, I couldn’t get it too shut down. It felt like the on off button was not connecting properly. Went back to the store, and the tech went through the same things I did with no success. They wanted me to go outside the store and try the cellular data. I did that with no success. It would make calls and text, but not send or receive photos or data.I decided right then and there, after using 2 hours of my time, I was going return this defective device. I need more reliable equipment for use in my business. I’m a pilot. After paying $1000 plus for it, I was disappointed. I will reactivate my 6 plus, which never let me down, and then consider all other options. They offered to replace the phone with a refurbished unit, or send it in for repair. But since it’s brand new, I can return it per the store policy. I Just don’t feel good about how this has worked out but definitely don’t want to keep this 10s.	0

iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Marsupilami	2	Totally behind the competition. Viewpoints that drive you crazy - I give up!	2018-11-28	de	Autumn 2018. After my iPhone 6S, I had painfully switched to a Galaxy S8 (got the S8 for free). Terrible conversion from iOS to Android. And yes, even after about 5 weeks now I'm still cursing now and then on Android. A step back to the 6s was no longer possible; I was used to the big OLED display of the S8. However, after I really go off some iPhone features, I recently got myself an iPhone X 256m. Comparable surface S8 and X. Both from 2018 BJ. Both OLED from the house Samsung.- S8 has the sharper display. You can see it. Despite all the "" from xy ppi one sees no difference .. "" BUT! Looks man.- S8 has the harsher colors (I do not like myself, here is the iPhone better) - S8 has the sharper camera with the harsher colors (not realistic, but sharper and brighter) .- S8 with Android is customizable, iOS Static is always static. For this, iOS always and everywhere runs with all compatible devices (eg in the car, on the hi-fi system, etc.) - ... etc. In principle, there are nuances and thus differences to be forgiven. The reason why I still hand over the iPhone X.- Prices / Performance is subterraneous compared to the S8- The viewing angles are quite stable in S8, the iPhone X discolored with minimal movement, the display so strong that it annoys me animal (pictures, etc. are simply distorted by the "" handling "". Here, the "" Farbadjustment "" does not help, it is the Blickwinkel.Und before anyone asks ... I have sent it and (today) get the "" repaired "" Phone with a new display (Therefore, today the unnerved review. Finally, have my proof before and after the repair.) Minimal improvement, a few tiny degrees more are now in. It is not enough Here, the S8 is so much better, and only costs 1/3 of the iPhone X. both phones side by side and moves the devices synchronously, you can see quite quickly the difference. What brings me the "" better "" Color / Brightness / ... Appearance of the iPhone X when the colors / presentation in the "handling" of the phone so deteriorate that it annoys you?!

The camera is in comparison to other devices pure mediocrity and from the IPS 68 certification of the iPhone 7, Apple itself does not seem quite convinced (or why else the warranty committee?) My iPhone 7 (including the devices from my circle of acquaintances) were noticeable slower in the course of the last 7-10 months.

I bought this new iPhone, because I wanted something more, something new and different ... instead I found myself holding an iphone 7 plus, a little smaller ... with a camera that was the same but positioned differently and a horrible cleat (notch) in front of the display that basically turns everything you watch on the screen ugly. Non-expandable memory, no fast recharging and even IP68 certification to withstand water and dust, not to mention the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to transfer photos and other media to the PC, everything is slow and cumbersome and iTunes is really a slow and heavy program. Practically an old iPhone for a big change, which has only the price of change, twice the price of a normal iPhone, an absurd price and totally unjustified for what this phone really offers! Equal in all respects to the old models. To say that I am disappointed is an understatement ... I do not recommend the purchase, if you are looking for the wow effect, move on to the competition, which here is only the salty price.	0

If you want to shoot a longer video with external micro and has to recharge the battery or wants to use a power bank - bad luck! The transfer of mobile phone to PC does not work, you always have to use the iCloud, with many data you have to buy additional storage - a monthly amount I can not erase the backup of my old iPhone from the new iPhone, so it just shut off while filming. In addition, it is quickly hot when filming ... All in all, so just annoying, because you rely on the various software from Apple and this unfortunately only partially work.

iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Patrick Peter Schmidt	2	Too restrictive	2016-04-06	de	I bought the iPhone 6S because I am very satisfied with the iMac 5K. However, taking over my old files from the Samsung Galaxy S 5 did not work out at all! In the settings of the font, which is also very small, there are only 2 options. The smartphone is really good, if you always had Apple devices. In any case, Android's transition is paved with violent stumbling blocks. I would have wished that with such an expensive device a reasonable software to take over the files of Android devices is! That's why I gave the smartphone back. As I said, the smartphone is good, but these restrictive Apple speak for me currently against the iPhone. Maybe it manages so that Android smartphones are recognized on the iMac and there is a software for data synchronization between Android and Windows Phone devices.	0

So are currently devices from the production period of the middle of the year 2018 called back by the manufacturer. A defect on the motherboard was found. The result showed u.a. In the form of a "" frozen "" display or the separateness of the Touchscreens.Leider I had to give back in March bought IPhone 8 again. Not all devices were affected. On the homepage of Apple is listed in more detail. At least there can be seen (input the serial number) which device is affected. I can only rate the iPhone 8 with 2 stars, although I have always been satisfied with Apple devices. Shame!	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	checkout	2	Too bad for the earphones with lightning connector and consequent lack of mini jack audio output	2019-03-06	it	Given that I am very satisfied with the purchase, I rate the article with only two stars due to the unfortunate choice of Apple to exclude the audio output with mini jack and to allow the use of the earphones only with a Lightning connector (the same as you use to recharge your mobile phone). With these earphones you can no longer easily switch from the iPhone to your computer (which uses mini jack outputs), you will no longer be able to connect to the traditional audio output of seats on trains and airplanes, or even on the ergometer monitor of your gym. You won't even be able to use your favorite headphones to listen to your music because they won't enter the lightning output. There is yet another adapter that will drag all the drawbacks of the case: you lose it, you forget it, when you need it you don't find it, and I read reviews of some models that do not allow listening to phone calls but only music ... so you are more confident if you buy the original Apple adapter, as always, very expensive. Really an unpleasant choice from Apple.	0

iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	nexus-hh	1	Overpriced high-tech scrap	2016-07-23	de	I got the iPhone 6S cheap from the circle of acquaintances, otherwise I always had Android devices. But since I have an iPad, I already knew the software a bit. So the processing is already the first criticism, the slide for the Nano Sim card can move with too much game when it is plugged. Even the home button has too much play and clacking for this price range. The back scratched extremely lightly, the front not so easy. You can not offer a cell phone for such a high price and then say that customers should buy a protective cover so that it does not scratch, it has to be built more robust, so it will be a shoe out of it! In this respect, the much-praised processing quality of iPhones is just a marvel, you just have to look closely, then you realize the miscibility, which are simply unacceptable in the price range. Otherwise, the screen is sharp, but in 2016 with its 4.7 inches and HD resolution not up to date, it should be in my opinion already 5 inches, incomprehensible that Apple is there so hesitant and backward-facing. The operation is really bad in relation to Android devices. This concept of closing with the home button has never opened to me. Why not use the backspace or exit key as touch keys ?? This is also possible with the Assistive Touch function, but not very elegant. The apps run smoothly, but updates take too long even in the WLAN network. The cameras are both good, there is nothing to moan about. The more outrageous that one does not install an optical image stabilizer in this price range. The camera looks out of the too heavy case out (just under 140 grams), the device gets very hot under high load, the battery is a bad joke, no FM radio included, resolution under Full HD. All in all, the device for 850 euros new price in the 64 GB version is much too expensive and the money should make more sense to invest. But as long as there are enough people who throw money into the mouth of Apple for such technology, the probably more fat and the poor factory workers in China are getting dehydrated. Apple runs the Android manufacturers technically for years afterwards. 3D-Touch does not need a human, it would be enough, you hold down a little longer than to apply so much pressure on the screen. Something completely incomprehensible: the fingerprint sensor works only after you have previously pressed the power or home button. Other manufacturers can do that so that you only have to hang up your finger and it is unlocked. The headphones from Apple are miserable, both in sound and build quality, and also slip out of the ear due to the strange shape. The voice quality when telephoning is in view of the price just as bad to call, there is always an annoying noise floor available. I give the iPhone 6S now someone who really wants it, I do not, what a miserable phone.	0

And I love big phones! What would you recommend? Which of the 3's? Please only give some tips that have the respective IPhones :) that would help me the most !!

iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Malabulaba	1	Excessively overrated product with many disadvantages	2019-01-01	de	For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Only good if the phone with the display is up on the table! Warranty / Guarantee: Although the iPhone X is really high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Stiftung Warentest rated the iPhone X even as "the most fragile iPhone ever". "Apple generally gives its products only 12 months of manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the pricing policy almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone X from the my assessment of a star refers exclusively to the criticisms mentioned above.Note: factual comments I am happy to answer, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and nicely with criticism ht can handle! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	FcBayernGrafBecker	1	Ugly, cheap and itunes heavy	2015-10-18	de	Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Hannes	5	The phone itself was great, it had to return nevertheless ....	2017-01-01	de	I do not need to say much about the iPhone 7 ... just great! Nevertheless, I had to return the phone because the version I ordered in Austria did not work. Nothing was mentioned by the provider, especially since the shipping to Austria was also offered. After unpacking the mobile phone, I had the first (negative) Aha moment. There was no EU plug, but the power plug for the US ..... this was not the main problem. IPhone 7 charged (of course, with a "" normal "" plug for Austria), Austrian SIM card inserted, go through the first part of the registration on the iPhone, Game over! SIM card is not recognized. Then tried several Austrian SIM cards, unfortunately no success. Because of this, I had to understand slowly now that this sold and offered version of the iPhone 7 does not work for EUROPE. The Amazon support contacted, problem described, order no. communicated, and recognized the local hotline lady also immediately that the offered version passed on any information to the customers that it is a pure US iPhone 7. Returns are accepted immediately, and credit is made. Have a European version - and all Tip Top! Thank you Amazon for this great transaction within 4 days.	0
iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Katja	1	Attention: No connection on this seller line	2017-11-07	de	The iPhone 7 is perfect in my view - except for a trifle: phoning does not work.

Noise, background noise, choppy, etc. The seller, I have been written several times> no answer. The iPhone 7 is therefore a gamble. It may be that you are lucky and get a usable model. One thing I can say but: with this provider, there is no service. Not even an answer!	0
iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	SuzieQ	2	Supplied by A-Mountain: Vodafone (!) IPhone 8 with deviating item no. !!!	2018-07-06	de	Offered and ordered was a vendor neutral (!) IPhone MQ6H2ZD / A 8 64 GB silver. After a delivery time of 2 days, I received the device with unofficial glued serial or article numbers. Conspicuous was the conformity guarantee of the company Vodafone (!) In Italian. It may indeed be that the devices for the different EU countries do not differ technically, but no one guarantees me that on the device not pre-installed Vodafone software or apps that you either do not want or may not get off the device. Therefore, I do not necessarily agree with a pre-review on the safety of deviating article numbers. Everyone likes to assess the risk for themselves, for high-priced items, I simply expect a correct settlement (ordered = delivered). The item is therefore zurück.Verpackung and delivery time flawless.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Gregorina	1	iphone is finally not working and seller is not responding	2018-11-06	de	I bought this iphone and immediately it was not working, upon a contact with the seller, he exchanged for another new one.  That one had faulty speakers and I went to apple for warranty, they changed the whole front panel.  Few months later I noticed that speakers were again down and went to apple again, this time apple exchanged for the whole new iphone, which again did not work from the start but unfortunately one year warranty by Apple expired.EU directive imposed a two-year warranty period in the EU and if if manufacturers warranty is limited to one year, the seller should be responsible.  This iphone is a bit older that a year, I tried to contact the seller few times, Amazon customer services contacted seller twice, this seller ignore all.I will have to deal with Amazon now, because it is set by law that there is a two year warranty for products sold in the EU, especially for such costly ones.As for apple... I somehow think that minor retail shops get unsuccessful batches of apple products (lets say the ones that apple cannot expect for sure that all the manufacturing conditions have been fulfilled in a full form).This is my first problem with apple products among iphones, ipads and macbooks but I also never bought before through internet.  I guess not worth it!	0

Update: after a month the phone has not been repaired because I have to disable a function. I am informed that I will be returned and then once I reset I will have to send it back for repair. after a few days they insist on replacing the mobile phone or making me a refund, despite insisting that I have work data inside and I have to recover it. I would like to know where the phone is? Amazon disappointment.	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Jonathan Shore	2	Not as good as the 6	2016-12-28	uk	I'm sufficiently sad to have had every iPhone model that's come out - and am no fan of Android phones at all. But...the iPhone 7 simply isn't worth it. I have an iPhone 6 for work so can do head-to-head comparisons. Now maybe it's because the uk iPhone 7 has the apparently rubbish intel chip, but the 6 outperforms the 7 significantly in two key respects - mobile signal reception and wifi reception. I park the two phones next to each other and while the 7 struggles to get signal, the 6 is happily connected.Whatever else a smartphone is meant to do, making phone calls and going online is where it all starts from and in this respect the 7 is a  wry expensive fail. The camera however is superb, can't begin to say how much better the pictures are - a real step forward in quality.But for the basics, the 7 doesn't live up to its price tag and I find myself having to use the 6 on frequent occasions (travel a lot for work) because the 7 is floundering. Can't deny that although I will probably be in the queue when the 8 comes out I feel really let down by the 7.Yes, it's waterproof too but given my absentminded habit of giving my phones regular rides in the washing machine, I'm not sure it's that waterproof. The 7 is a bit like visiting an Apple Store at the weekend - it looks fantastic but is ultimately totally frustrating because you can't get any service.	0
iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	g9486	2	It is in the old pots that we make the best soup	2019-01-26	fr	I kept my iPhone X a year and I resigned myself to return to a model with digital recognition, I never adapted to the facial recognition. The unlock is almost instantaneous on an iPhone 8 by pressing the Home button on the screen. iPhone X must: 1- that the device understands all one wants to unlock it by analyzing the movements of the device, often either he understands nothing at all, or it triggers facial recognition too early. 2- You have to catch the small tab at the bottom of the screen and put it up so as to indicate to the phone that you want to use it (I never understood why they put this step) If we add the many editors of apps that have not updated their apps for the screen of the iPhone X and the repeated bugs of iOS on iPhone X, I can say that it is with undisguised joy that I return to the iPhone 8.	0

I have not heard from anyone since it was return June 1, 2019, even the tracking information is f-ed up.

iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Kyoshi	4	Not revolutionary but a good smartphone anyway	2017-10-10	fr	A good smartphone but nothing revolutionary.That's the summary of reviews in general.So ... Not where to start? Often considered a simple evolution of the iPhone 7 (aesthetic very close except the glass back of the latest model), the iPhone 8 brings a few changes: - Faster (thanks to the A11 chip) - Better photo processing (you will find several tests on the net) - Compatible with the Qi charge ... And this is the novelty. Indeed, you can now charge the iPhone by putting it on a charger Qi ... No need to connect the iPhone.The nice thing also is that the memory capacity starts at 64gb (64gb or 256gb in fact). ... Despite this little change, the iPhone 8 (Plus) is a very good phone and we find the qualities of the brand.The screen is very good, the overall finish is very good, powerful and made beautiful photos (Obviously ... Accustomed to SLR ... Difficult to judge a smartphone on it ... But to troubleshoot, I find it convenient). Autonomy is good from the comparisons that we find ... Sorry ... I do not buy an array of Smartphone to compare:) ... Although I am amazed at the autonomy of my Samsung A5 2016 job that I only charge twice in the week (except for Cisco Spark and checking mails ... The use is only by telephone). Speaking of battery life ... The battery capacity is down compared to the iPhone 7 but it is obviously inconsequential ... Good ... For those who know the developments Apple, you will know that there is more to jack jacks (but the adapter is provided ... note that it can not be used wired). Several other brands have followed the movement ... Even Google who have made fun of Apple on this point ... By cons ... the iPhone 8 Plus is a heavyweight office compared to its competitors.If I compare the iPhone 8 Plus (offered to my wife) and my OnePlus 3T ... We feel the difference.Why so few changes? Just because of the iPhone X that will be released soon to write these lines.Quelles differences? Here is what I selected (in favor of the iPhone X of course): - Better screen resolution - Screen that occupies the entire surface before (or almost) - Facial identification.A still note for this last point, what the facial recognition of the iPhone X has nothing to do with that of the last Samsung that you can unlock with a simple photo (bravo security). Indeed, if I do not say nonsense, he There are 30000 IR control points on the iPhone X ... So, if you are in the dark, you put glasses or change your cuts, it will work (theoretically for now ... seen apart at the Keynote where we saw it in action ... And again ... There was a loupé ...). So ... Buy or not this iPhone 8 (Plus)? Ben ... Clearly, if you already have an iPhone 7 (More) ... The interest is minimalThe Smartphone is very expensive ... Damn ... 900 € !!! Well ... It is true that given the time that people spend above ... It's prorated more profitable than a lot of other things.The Smartphone remains a recurring budget for more and more people.The real question will remain ... iOS (the Apple system) or Android (a huge choice and for all budgets)? These are two different philosophies ... For my part, we chose an iPhone (and more specifically iOS) when: - we want to be quiet with a stable system - we want a smartphone turnkey without having to search right and left this or that application - we want to keep a system up to date (with Apple, when a new version of iOS comes out ... The update is available on all iPhone versions at the same time time...Except for the models of 5 years ago) - it does not necessarily hack his phone (easier on Android). I have the following iPhones: EDGE / 3GS / 5 / 5S and my wife the 4 or the 4S.This works ... Never had any particular problem (small bugs exist but it is rare and does not last) .Good, the only thing that can be boring is that we do not really feel to change the phone from one iPhone to the other. There are of course several improvements systems, etc ... A better responsiveness and everything ... But the system itself remains the same.On may be trying to go elsewhere ... But we are not necessarily conquered elsewhere ... My wife went on a OnePlus One after her iPhone ... She is not a fan of Android at all (and the phone has made the soul so good ). It has chained a number of problems ... Two trips / return service ... And more ... Just after the last service, the phone still has a problem ... But since the guarantee was passed and obviously at OnePlus they do not guarantee their repair (which had just been realized ... Two weeks ready) ... Not wanting to fight any longer.She is happy to have an iPhone again.My ... After my iPhone 5S, I went to Android with a OnePlus 3T.Pourquoi? Because of the price ... Do not hide the face.Some things irritated me on Android (to manage several mails ... A pleasant and free client ... Apart from BlueMail who did not always recover my mails automatically ... Pay to have a calendar in CalDAV while it is native on an iPhone, etc ...) but I'm not disappointed either. It's nice to be able for example to manage its downloads as if you were on your computer ... Or to add music without going through an application ... Have dual SIM (to manage the SIM card of work and that perso), etc.I will definitely go back to iOS for my next phone.That's my opinion ... :)	0
iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	2	Disappointing except for the operating system.	2019-03-02	de	Worst display I've ever seen in a smartphone in this price range. Have times on the Samsung Galaxy S7 parallel to Xr run a video. The S7 is much better. The black value of the Xr is ridiculous. Other manufacturers make that much better. Amoled makes it possible. Too bad, because I find the operating system Umschlagbar and the quality is also true. Iphone XR is most likely going back. Ahja, the camera I think synonymous not necessarily good.	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Customer	1	Cant wait to go back to android!	2019-05-31	us	I just got my first iPhone ever, and Ive had it for over a month...and its TERRIBLE!-phone volume controls all sound, including alarms, ringtones, media and any bluetooth device youre connected to. horrible setup. especially if you want the Alarm you have set to wake you up, but dont want phone calls or messages to bother you. and for the bluetooth this is really frustrating because you cant use the full volume range of the speaker without distortion of the sound, because you cant balance the input volume to the speaker with the playback volume.-touch response is terrible. about half the time I try scrolling up, the phone scrolls left to the previous page or screen. rather frustrating, and just plain annoying-battery life okay, but not great, especially if youre actually using the phone, it dies fast-camera takes amazing photos, AS LONG AS YOU ARE VIEWING THEM ON AN APPLE SCREEN, as soon as you display them on anything else, its just another photo from a phone camera- no expandable storage? oh thats right, so they can sell me cloud storage thats so clearly easy to hack...no thanks- lots of other pointless and not intuitive operation methods, like, to edit an alarm, you have to select edit, then the alarm, and to edit another, you gotta go back up and hit edit again....why design this way? zero user fluidity...ALSO, wanna click on the notification to open it? nah, you gotta slide to right to open and left for other operations, or slide it up for a faster go away response, which is the same as swipe left option, so again redundant, non-fluid operation that could easily be designed another way.My first iPhone will be my last. I gave it some time, but this entire setup and function design is really far from intuitive or fluid. I finally truly realize why everyone I know in program engineering or computer science has an Android.I know theyre popular, but like...The united states is literally known in part for its poor education and stupidity...no wonder this country loves this phone!!!	0

Right side has a gap between the display and the case, which you can not only see, but the edge is therefore also sharp. The device is fast, fluid and good, but so poor final inspection for so much money ... No, I'm not satisfied! Only one star because of much too high price and bad final control.

iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	N.	3	Interesting but ...	2017-05-22	fr	To make a comment clear iPhone 7 Gold 32 GOVendeur 639 eurosA originally, I was looking for an iPhone 6S, cheaper. I went to the Apple site, then other sites and I stumble on a iPhone 7 32 GB for a price lower than a 6S! A conble.Je sell my iPhone 5S speedy and place the order with some excitement (price, marketplace ...). The only point that reassured me was the compatibility "" Prenium "" of the product (without this logo I will not have ordered). Is this a refurbished phone? Opportunity ? Apple's unwanted? I get the phone the day after the order. The packaging is poor (- 1 star), there was no protection, bubble or foam, the packaging was really at least (same packaging as for CD / BluRay) .Ni one, nor two, I take the serial number on the box (with Eastern European scripts) and I check its guarantee on the Apple website. It has never been put into service, it is a new iPhone! I will not apologize for the iPhone 7, other reviews and sites do it better than me.I will add a note (which makes me remove another star from the product): This is the warranty. In France, the iPhone is guaranteed two years, thanks to the legal guarantee of conformity, a formidable weapon for the consumer, which poses in case of breakdown of the phone a presumption of defectiveness on the device ... The first year, you can go to Apple, they will handle the problem, the second, it will advise with the seller ... There the difficulties begin. In my opinion, when you buy here, with a third-party seller, who more abroad ... Admittedly, you will only have a one-year warranty, that of Apple and nothing else. It remains a contractual warranty, the AppleCare + 149 euros which will protect your iPhone for 3 years. This is a calculation to make.In summary: - iPhone 7 nine- Packaging too fragile for a product of this value, it is not a CD! - Attention to the guarantee which is de facto limited Finally, I am ALWAYS in the wait for the invoice from the seller. I will change this comment when I have it and if I do not have it, one less star. This will be embarrassing to resale in a few years.	0

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Jupiter III	2	Paper tiger for 6S owners	2017-11-12	de	3G, 4, 5, 6 Plus, 6S Plus. The 8 Plus is the first iPhone, the purchase of which I regret and gives me little added value in practice compared to the 6S Plus, on the contrary. This starts with the very nature of a phone calling , Directly after delivery discussions were accompanied by an unpleasant crackle. A later version of iOS brought a workaround by software, yet voices sound much more metallic flatter, unnatural than the iPhone 6S. Something that not only shows on the phone, but also the sound of video recordings. Photos and videos have more dynamics in the evening or dark situations and the white balance is better. In addition, there is 4K recording capability with 60fps and higher frame rate in slow motion. Something that you can only use if you leave the default set more compressed encoding format. Compared to the normal video / image format, it saves a lot of space, but the pictures are muddy, details are lost, so that in sum there is hardly any benefit left. The display is marginally better in comparison to the 6S, but you can see the main difference at night, because the 8 Plus darkens more. In practice, only the iPhone X shows a qualitatively remarkable jump. Also, only on paper one has something of the higher performance. There were no applications for me on the 6S that would have been too slow and those that have jerked on the 6S are also jerking on the 8 Plus. That said, it's the programming of the app, not the performance. Support for wireless charging is certainly an advantage for those who use it. The necessary glass back makes it more sensitive to falls than the metal back of the 6S. Certainly one can argue about what is more aesthetic. If you use a bumper, you can only see the camera slits and tiny differences in the front of the speakers, whether it's a 6, 6S, 7 or 8. Anyway, better water protection is an advantage. I've used all the iPhones in the water so far and could avoid a water damage, but it is certainly not a mistake in case of the cases to be armed. Unfortunately, this water protection is at the expense of the headphone jack. Again, everyone likes to discuss individually who uses them, how much / uses them. In any case, it is one feature less and, in case of necessity, forces an adapter that does not actually improve the sound quality.The battery is smaller than the 6S. Due to the better processor efficiency this should be more than balanced. As far as the final version of iOS 11 is concerned, that is quite a comprehensible statement and even exceeds the runtime of the 6S. However, the thing has a taste. The iOS 11 beta release in early August was the best operating system version ever on the 6S in terms of energy efficiency. Even the optimized iOS 10 versions could not keep up with that. With each new version, the battery life of the 6S was reduced significantly, so that in the official iOS 11 version almost twice as often the 6S had to be loaded than a few weeks before. It's understandable, of course, that Apple is optimizing iOS 11 with a focus on iPhone 8 and X at the end and less on the old models, as I said, it has a connotation anyway. The biggest horse foot of the 8 Plus, however, is the GPS accuracy. In no iPhone / iPad before, the position was often displayed next to the road, even in the open air. It also does not help to reset the factory and switch the locale as it is sometimes generally suggested. I made a few direct comparisons out there with the 6S and iPad Air 2, and in almost all cases it was the 8 Plus that was the largest in Apple Maps' circle of inaccuracy. One point that I will address to the support, however, is found in forums to relatively many comparable entries in which repair and even device replacement have brought nothing and is spoken under the hand of a design problem. However, in terms of open support contact, this point is not included in the rating. What was and is for me personally the most important upgrade reasons is the increased main memory and the 256GB memory space that was not offered on the 6S model. Since this would have been technically possible, and was only offered for economic reasons, I forgive only one star. The higher internal memory speed and thus reduced upgrade / backup time is worth a second star in practice for me. The better water protection would be a star , he would not at the expense of Kopfhörerbuchse.Die slightly better camera is thwarted by the poorer image quality of the compression. One could discuss in total for 3 stars to award, which would probably be fair compared to smartphones from other manufacturers. On the other hand, the benchmark of my rating is the 6S. Purely by feel, the jump from 6S to 8 in practice is smaller than it was the 6S to 6. So I can not give a clear conscience 2 stars for such a smartphone in 2017, for the Apple requires more than 1000 euros. My recommendation to all 6S owners who manage with 128GB is one year to wait for the successor of the X. Since the teething problems are eliminated and you get a real added value for this money.	0
iPhone XS Max	64GB	Silver	JW	1	Data reception sucks on Intel iPhone models like the Xs	2019-06-02	us	Bought my XS from Apple direct and love mostly how it operates, but there’s one main thing that sucks, the data reception reliability, sometimes it’ll refuse to work even in places where I usually get good reception like 70/80 download speeds, I assume this is because Apple decided to go in fight with Qualcomm and have inferior Intel modems	0
iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	mixdevil	3	no longer perfect	2018-10-25	de	First I would like to say what bothers me and what I've experienced so far (iPhone owners are iPhone 2). The iPhone crashes regularly at regular intervals, often you do not notice it because it looks normal again after booting, you just have to enter the pin because the face ID does not work then. Most often, the error occurs in long-term use, eg via bluetooth in the car listening to music over the car radio. It happens that it crashes every 20 minutes. What then helps is a shutdown and start again, then I'm lucky that it runs over an hour. I have normal day use that happens to me only 2-3 times a day. As I have learned in forums, this is not uncommon. This has never happened to me before. Otherwise, I find the quantum leap from iPhone 8 to iPhone X just succeeded and long overdue, the operation is intuitive and face Id works mostly very well. The price, on the other hand, is an absolute impudence, how many billions will apple still want to gain. 1000 euro for the 256 Gb device would have been absolutely sufficient, especially since the memory costs nothing more. For this reason, I will again downgrade the next model and take the cheaper even if I then have to do without OLED and the second camera	0

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Sportydriver	4	My first iPhone and only trouble	2017-10-25	de	After being an Android user for many years, I decided to give Apple a try because I did not want Android on the "" crafting system "". In the hope of a stable, mature operating system along with the iPhone 8 Plus, I'm rather disappointed after a week. Sure, iOS has some advantages, such as fast apps. I did not know anything like that before. On the Internet in no time, there is really joy auf.Aber unfortunately, there are still many construction sites, which are largely due to a very poor operating system: - Even recorded photos (no live images) are in a folder with WhatsApp images, etc. in one Folders are packed and can not be stored separately in a separate folder. A separate folder for portraits, for live images and even one for WhatsApp. Only the "" normal "" images come in a collection folder. What a nonsense !!! - Image information of recordings, such as creation date and time does not exist. Only if one loads the pictures on the PC, one can call this information. - Which I also instead, my email accounts can not be updated regularly with the email app. I can do what I want. It does not work. Only another email app helped. Apple! - Today tried to pull pictures from the iPhone to the Windows PC. The copying by explorer still worked. But then I noticed that the images are saved in a format called HEIC and can not be opened with anything. So called the hotline and first bumped into perplexity. HEIC said nothing to the employee. After a long wait the solution was found. There is a setting where you can change the whole thing so that JPEG are saved. What a drama! - Sending and receiving images via Bluetooth is of course not possible. Now some will scream again that you know something like that before and you can inform yourself. I did not know and thought 2017 is something as natural as Android has been possible for many, many years.- If you go under settings - battery then you jump somehow constantly while scrolling back and forth. You can then choose between consumption of the last 24 hours and 3, 4 or 5 days what appears there to choose is apparently a matter of luck. Time is 3 days, times 5, times 4. What is this nonsense? - Connect to iTunes? No problem, but apart from advertising, advertising and advertising again, it seems to be completely pointless. I've spent 2 days trying to load images into any clouds and automatically sync them. I'm too stupid for that or I'm smart. Unlocking iTouch works very well, except for the fact that you sporadically land on the lock screen and I'm told to press the button again. 10 times the home screen opens directly and then again, although the device was unlocked. It's annoying - well, then at least it will work with navigation. So today on the way the Navi started by Siri and entered destination. Wonderful, the Navi starts its service and shows me the route. But something is missing. Right, no speech! No matter what I tried, it was silent. Certainly, the phone is smarter than me here.- Two times it has already happened that I could unlock the phone on an incoming message, which was seen as a banner on the lock screen, by simply wiping the banner to the right. No Touch ID required !!! If you call Android as a craft OS, should try out the new iPhone 8 Plus. Update 01.11.2017einige problems have done in the meantime.- So the email accounts now work without problems.- image information is actually displayed (sorry , my mistake) .- Touch ID works now also, thanks to an additional setting (hidden in the menu) reliable.- the iCloud works after a long time back and forth, now also remain so far the strange photo folder, where all pictures land and one is forced Moving your own recordings into separate albums and the lack of ability to send / receive files like photos via Bluetooth (to Android) Therefore now 4 instead of 3 stars.	0

The iPhone X is just garbage. The touchscreen is not responding properly. At the edge, movements with the finger are not recognized or not recognized correctly. Zooming with the 2-finger gesture works in Safari only randomly, because as soon as you take your fingers off the screen, the zoom effect is back to standard back. Apart from the incredibly poor operation, not even Apple works since the last iOS update Carplay right. There are always disconnections and Apple support does not help you. There are only "" you have already tried another cable or iPhone "" standard answers. If you throw € 1,000 in the garbage bin, that's better than buying this phone.

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Matthias	2	I love Apple - but THAT is not here at all :-( iPhone 7 the pure disappointment, I stay with the iPhone SE ...	2016-09-21	de	Well, what can I say, I'm really disappointed. As much as I love Apple and like to pay the money. I have a lot of devices from Apple in use and had in the past pretty much every iPhone. Most of the time I ordered it right after the keynote, because I never really could wait and it was well worth it. But since the release of the iPhone 6S, Apple has left something to be desired as far as the iPhone is concerned. I try that - just in terms of the iPhone 7 to justify something. Maybe some people think about that instead of throwing their money out the window ... 1. Less and less novelties - but always more expensive Somehow, nothing more really happens at Apple. as far as the iPhone is concerned. Not just visually, but generally. Apple presents things and argues with things that other manufacturers have long since, where this is already standard. For example the thing with IP67 and things like that. Somehow nothing is doing more - and I think that's a pity. Because there was a time, there it was still very different ... Especially in times of Steve Jobs, RIP. I do not know, I would just wish that I get more for my money than the whole 0815 crap. Do not misunderstand, technically the iPhone is, especially now with the 7, of course, top and there is nothing to complain about it. But does all that really justify such an enormous price of over 1000 euros? No.2. Always bigger, but why the hell no 4-inch version anymore? What I do not like is the growing size! I'm one of many who do not want to carry a brick with them. I prefer the 4 "variant, which was the reason to switch from the iPhone 6S to the iPhone SE again - which makes me very grateful that Apple has released this" special edition ". So, why the hell again only a 4.7 and 5.5 inches version? Why bring an alternative to the big models back on the market, if you destroy them directly at the release of the new generation? What kind of sense does it make? There are many like me who would prefer the 4 "version - you could clearly see on the iPhone SE. For me that's why the 7 Series is not for me in question, much I prefer keeping my iPhone SE.3. Different features to the "" brick "" (Plus model) What should actually this crap with the different features in the models? Why has only the plus the 2nd Camera Lens from the telephoto lens? That's just the whole people fooled. As if this feature could not be included in the 4.7 "version. You do not understand, for all love.The Plus model is really nothing, the part is too big. Even had the iPhone 6S Plus - put it in your pocket in summer when you're wearing shorts. No, just no. Alone half the tablet to hold the phone to the ear, 188g heavy ... No, again no. Nothing for me ... (matter of taste, no question ...) 4. Same design, old technology, where is the innovation?! I always smile when I look at the Apple Keynote on the iPhone. People are blinded by such massive improvements, especially compared to older models. More speed, better CPU / GPU blah blah ... What itches me! Anyone who already knows an iPhone knows exactly that they always run fluffy and never hang! I have never noticed a really noticeable difference. Benchmark back and forth - it does not itch me anything, because you hardly notice it anyway, if you use it just as normal. Camera is the only thing that happens every now and then, if only minimally. But instead of finally integrating this ugly camera lens into the (!) Case, no, they remove the 3.5mm jack connector and only offer Lightning. It does not seem to matter that you can not charge iPhone 7 AND listen to music at the same time. Since you have to (no, you should) just for a sleazy 170.- Euro buy the new wireless headphones ... Yes no, is clear! Back to the camera lens, which still stands out the back, which in my opinion would be really better to solve (other manufacturers manage it): The only reason why the iPhone has not been thinner and slimmer so far, were 2 reasons: The 3, 5mm jack connection as well as the theme of robustness. NOW, I'm curious to see if there's something new next year and Apple finally gets the turn again - or if the scrape really goes on like the last years. I mean hey, that the jack-connection fell off I really do not care, but I want the iPhone compact, thinner, smaller and without a protruding camera lens, so you can put it on the table, without having to use a shell MUESS.The annoying! -Fact is, I will pay no Euro for the iPhone 7, if, then only at contract renewal, I should then get it for free. Because I'm not ready to pay so much money for such a crap. Please do not get me wrong, it may be technically top, no question. But I'm just concerned that people are blinded with tiny things and everyone thinks they have to have that, just because it's the newest iPhone. That in the 7er, however, to 50% the same hardware as in the 6S, nobody seems to bother. That's just not worth the money! One can argue about the size of the memory, I've always found this an impudence from Apple, but it has always been like that. At least they have now finally adopted the 16GB variant, which was really no longer timely. Because after iOS 9 or 10 were already 4-6 GB occupied, so you would like to have just under 10 GB for your own use. But that's a different story, where everyone has to decide for themselves, which one of the storage is ultimately worth or how much you need. I keep my iPhone SE for now, see no reason to pay the significant extra price, only to my neighbors, friends and acquaintances to show that I have the latest iPhone 7, so they all envy me so much. Find it a pity, especially since I take a lot of pictures and movies, I would have liked the new features of the camera - but not under these "circumstances". Who has the money, please. Loss of value at Apple is thank God very low, so that at any time an Apple iPhone can always sell well. The fact that some are currently offered back on eBay for over 1700, - Euro, just because you have to wait on Apple shows once again just the profit greed of the people ... Apple iPhone 7, how should I love you, you have really disappointed me , driven me away from you, you are indeed really chic, otherwise not wrong, but what you offer me now, it is not worthy to me. In my opinion, save the money and keep the iPhone 6S / SE, is just as good. But this is just my personal objective opinion, based on experience and facts.	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	miknkia	3	From the perspective of a former Android user	2017-07-03	de	For a week I own the iPhone 7 Plus and am satisfied but not enthusiastic. Previously, I only ever had cheaper smartphones (Android). But my last cell phone got on my nerves at some point so that I wanted to buy a new one. This time I wanted to treat myself something high quality. First, the choice should fall on the Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. Since I did not like the quality of the phone but I bought an iPhone 7 Plus.Bisher I had only heard good things about the iPhone 7 Plus and decided relatively quickly for me without informing me more. However, that was a mistake, because only afterwards I noticed the following negative points: - The Iphone has no back button (super-nervous, because you can never go back a step, if one has clicked, bad luck.) - The battery does not hold As long as promised, it will last a maximum of 8 hours with mediocre use. My Asus Zenfone, with whom I was not satisfied, kept much longer.- I can not delete a letter when I am committed to a word, but I have to rewrite the whole word - very time-consuming.- The Appstore has far not to offer as much as the Playstore.- the Iphone costs a whopping 850 ¬ and I see no significant difference to a 250 ¬ device. The surcharge is not worth it. What I've noticed positively: - the camera has a good quality- the operating system is fast- noble design- Siri and Facetime are goodies that are fun and that only exists on the Iphone. The iphone is in my opinion very overpriced and offers simply too little for the price, since other cheaper mobile phones are just as good. I would not get it again. The next phone will be an android again! Do not understand the hype around the iphone at all.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Benedictu	2	iPhone is pure consumerism, because again there is no good reason to use the latest model for more than a year	2017-02-26	de	Does one have to have the device, if one does not get it just officially made available? The new waterproofness, the increased computing power, the better camera, the larger memory are conceivable reasons for purchase. Who decides on the device, the film Belkin ScreenForce InvisiGlass screen protector (suitable for iPhone 7), which is perfectly centered in the Apple store, and the case Apple MMW82ZM / A iPhone 7 Silicone Case black for protection and preservation of value recommended (see photo), so he gets rid of it in good time before the iPhone 8 at a good price. In the telephony Apple has lost the connection to the top. The so-called SAR value, which indicates the specific absorption rate of mobile phone radiation in watts per kilogram of body tissue, positions the iPhone 7 virtually as the tail light of the competitor field. The SAR reading of the iPhone 7 is still a factor of 1.4 from the limit of 2 W / kg with 1.38 W / kg, but in fact six times as high as some competing models, almost a factor of 10 stay below the limit. Those who often need to make calls in places with poor mast coverage or good shielding will be inclined to wait for an improved iPhone 8 or higher. FAZIT Apple is a rational actor taking advantage of its opportunities. To blame them is therefore as pointless as criticizing a US president or a car brand because it produces polluting SUVs. Because it is always the little man who has set the course by his choice. So as long as consumers are so uncritical about their favorite brands and with rather inconsequential innovations, which are commonly referred to as product care, cheer with 4- and 5-star reviews as in the sports palace, instead of just waiting for the next or next version it will continue for a long time. Also to the detriment of the environment, which is mainly burdened by the production of unnecessary electronics. A high-quality, elaborately produced electronic device, which one can not operate satisfied and with good conscience for some years, but because of its shortcomings better one sees the first best opportunity to get each newer, is a sacrilege. My favorite brand Apple has less to be ashamed of than its uncritical customers.	0

iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	2	Handy = Well, service = flop	2016-04-06	de	I bought the iPhone 6S about 1month before Christmas 2015 and had to notice with astonishment (about 2 months later) that dust in the form of small black dots under the screen was visible. So I sent in the device and got it back after a whopping 7 WEEKS. The screen has been replaced, but there is again a black dot in the middle of the screen. I've really wondered (because of the 7 months and no real improvement) if people at Apple are unable to work properly! So for this price (€ 740) it was a total REINFALL!

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	TM	1	Design, Weight, iOS Bugs	2019-05-22	de	The design is beautiful, no question. Unfortunately, it needs to be protected, ideally immediately. Thus, the iPhone X looks with shell, like any other phone. Without a cover, this phone loves to slide down everywhere, because glass is smooth. And glass is heavy too. The iPhone X is very heavy compared to other smartphones. This annoys especially with prolonged use and in your pocket. Furthermore, iOS 12 is full of bugs. FaceID suddenly stops working. Screentime names of the devices do not match. Websites can not be scrolled. Text flickers. The quality of the camera is nothing special. Without additional apps, photos can not even equalize. The operation without Homebutton annoying. Again and again nan unintentionally triggers screenshots. Installation of apps with a double-click is cumbersome. If problems, the Apple support arrogance is hard to beat. In summary, no innovation for the inflated price.	0

The ladies quickly understood that everything went pretty stupid and have exchanged the phone for a new one.I can now call! For now it stays at 3 points, in 4 weeks there may be more ...

Many have already described the technical details here. I would rather comment on the size, handling and feel. Unfortunately, I had no influence on the choice of my new device. The phone is very big. Way too big for average big / small hands. Even in inhand mode, I find it hard to reach the upper left corner. I've been used to using the phone with one hand for years. The XR is a torment. Also, the weight is a disaster. If you put the phone in a bumper, it gets even bigger and heavier. Writing an e-mail is very tiring for the hand. Absolutely unusable. The change from Touch-ID to Face-ID was a bit hard to get used to. But over time, I find it not so bad. The case itself is processed properly. But the sides of the phone are very slippery, so you have to spend a lot of power on a cell phone, so it does not slip through your fingers. The heavy weight is still counterproductive added. If I could, I would send it back immediately.	0

IPhone 7 + 128 gb, in the beginning everything was great, until I realized that the microphone was not working properly. No problem I thought, sent in and the service announces the display was broken and I would have to pay 200 € for a new one. It was a small scratch that did not bother me, I told you that I want a new microphone and no new display. Refused, sent back! Then to the store, spent the whole day there, who said they would like to do it but they have a lock on it that they could not do anything. So again called service and clarify the final, they are stubborn and do not want to swap my microphone. Man has to imagine that, you have an 800 ¬ expensive phone with which you can not call! The bad thing is you do not care about the customer. I have 4 Apple products and they do not think I can offer a solution. I also told you nicely that I will no longer use Apple and disconnect me from it. Thereupon some sarcastic remarks. So man loses customers. That was the last time I buy such items. I am now standing there with a cell phone that I can not tel. Apple does not care that a bit. I advise everyone to buy any device that is worth nothing to the customer!	0

Despite the long phone call the damage was not completely repaired. Today, on 10.7.- well beyond the maximum delivery date set by the first - I received the package ordered. The amazon packaging appeared to be intact, while once the package was opened, the iPhone box was cellophane-free and empty inside. The cellular device was missing, the cables and everything else boasted in the description of the product. The package is - or maybe I should say ERA - sold and shipped by amazon. As written, I immediately called the call center, which told me that there was no ready and equivalent substitute. The package contained a gift for a degree, to be celebrated on Thursday. Currently the situation in which it is paid is the following: - inability to place a new order for the equivalent product without added costs - inability to order a substitute to the product without further disbursements - damage from delay in delivery - damage from non-gift (as Thursday I will have to present myself at the unloaded degree of this). I thank Amazon for the unpleasant inconvenience to which it has not been able to give prompt repair and solution. You have certainly lost a customer.

Everything else the display, this is LCD, what you do not mind. So dear providers, goes with the times, down with the price	0
iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Thomas K.	1	Headache and eye pain due to oil technique and face ID	2018-02-12	de	I had to exchange the Iphone X for an Iphone 8Plus because I got a headache while using the device. When I turned off Face Id it got better, but my eyes continued to seep when reading websites. I entered "eyestrain with Iphone x" at Google and lo and behold: Many users have this problem due to an unobtrusive flickering of the OLED display. In addition, the attention check of the face-id camera ensures that the face is regularly scanned with UV rays. That can not be healthy! Since I own the Iphone 8Plus I have no more problems with it.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Martin	2	windfall	2017-07-31	de	This is my last iPhone since Generation 4's loyal customer! Why? For me, the iPhone has always been a "state of the art" product far beyond the competition, Jobs put a lot of passion in the development of devices next to a status symbol perfection In the point of quality and customer service was clearly noticeable in the first iPhones that this is a premium product. But with Generation 6, I noticed clearly that simply no lifeblood is in the development of the device, camera lenses that "slip" "and allegedly not a reason for complaint are ... just as the service of me hard on technology manufacturer of discounter reminiscent. Positive thinking, but I have decided for the 7, in the hope that it is a mature 6er (because optically has changed nothing), but I already regretted that after a very short time: / Yes the device brings innovations in comparison to the 6 series: - a button that is no longer a button- Forcetouch- Faster processor (who notices it, I do not) - better camera (I notice only in very faint pictures) For it likes to hang up for a few seconds, which I had previously experienced on any iPhone. Sometimes it has also simply do not feel like talking on the phone, and then with "" Call Failed "" word. In these situations, man can enjoy the silence of life, because without the one notices it (network is connected normally), callers are as busy / or unavailable signaled, without which you can even note it. If that was not enough, has my wife, who bought the same device in a different color at the same time, the same Probleme.Für me is the "" fun "" iPhone by the end of next year to extend the contract. Because it no longer embodies what it once was and the competition has not overslept the last 5 years, here was tightened and there are now significantly cheaper devices available that are similarly powerful .... but you pay not here for the name or the bad Kundenservice.Zur rating: I rate here with 2 stars because I product and price link together. Hot, for 250 ¬ I would give 4 stars, because it is simply a "" standard smartphone "" is. At a price of about 1000 €, however, I expect premium and the device is in no wise fair. If my recession has helped you in the product, I would be happy about a "" thumbs up "".	0

It leaves a lot of space next to it and can not compete with Samsung and Huawai mobile phones. I have owned this device for almost a year now and it has become a bit slow. IOS 11 is the worst IOS I've seen so far. It is bended and often crashes the phone. In addition missing important functions, such as: WLAN and Bluetooth can be switched off only on the settings. The phone is too expensive for the performance it brings. I can only advise against it.	0
iPhone X	256GB	Silver	MD007	1	Beware this may be a used phone pretending to be a new one	2018-12-30	uk	I would put a zero star rating if allowed.

Apple support that nothing can be done to remove them from the phone without the password for those accounts - clearly that is never going to happen.  So I am now going to have to take this gift back and send it back to Amazon.  Hardly Christmas.  Completely unacceptable.	0

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Tina	4	Note on the colors silver and gold	2017-09-27	de	This is not a product review, but a reference to anyone who thinks to order the iPhone 8 online: I have pre-reserved the iPhone 8 via the Apple Store - and sent back immediately after delivery. Reason: I ordered it in silver, like all its predecessors. Silver is only the border, the back is white. If you know it, scroll through the close-ups and look closely, you can see it on the Apple website too. If you do not know it, the back looks silver. The same applies to the color gold. Only the black version probably has a film under the glass back and is therefore black. Maybe you should know that before ordering. Unfortunately, the note is missing from Apple or I have not found it.	0

On the box was a completely different serial number to see, as in the device. I had bought the phone in gold, the serial number of the device showed after checking the Internet on a silver model. The device was also already in use, when I turned it on nothing had to be set up and it was directly the home screen with apps to see. Even after reset to factory settings (in the process was funny to see the Android icon) I could not log in as usual from Apple step by step. I have sent it back right now. Stay away from this device and buy directly from Apple.	0

According to Apple (Apple Store) is not new, since 2017 for the first time registered with Apple in the US, so the warranty is extinguished. In the context of customer satisfaction, Apple exchanges the phone for a surcharge of 50 € against a new device. I would avoid this seller. The phone itself is top!

iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	Marcel	1	Usury prizes for what Apple now gets the receipt	2018-12-03	de	It is a joke what Apple now calls for the iPhone! Not without reason, the sales go back significantly and I agree with the full! One think: There used to be the iPhone 8 and 8Plus for about 700 and 800 euros then came the X where many thought wooow a completely new premium iPhone for an extremely high premium price .... I bought it and must also say that I am completely disappointed with the processing ... I am an iPhone user of quasi first hour but that with a 1150 euro expensive smartphone on the back one side is sharp-edged than the other side (if one of the glass on the frame touches noticeable) is a NO GO! And now it is so the Apple again brings a Preiskracher and that XR the "cheap version" for the price that used to cost the premium model and for the normal model XS offers for over 1100 euros and the hammer! The big one for about 1200! Earlier IPhone 8 = 700 Euro model comparison XS = 1150 Euro8Plus = 800eueo XSMAX = 1200 Euro. As Apple has now finally overstepped the arc and this revenges itself now also on the basis of the new sales figures and that is completely deserved! Price so outrageously expensive then this will be my last iPhone sein.Und I have already heard of many people ... All the best with your usury strategy which slowly no longer rises what by the way applies to other Apple products. The competition is now at least equivalent and much much cheaper. Until then and goodbye Apple!	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	Matthew	2	I love Apple but hate this iPhone model	2018-11-04	us	I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6, which I had no issues with at all, other than it being antiquated. In fact, I loved the phone and all of the features. I'll make this review easy by simply listing the pros and cons.Pros:-Waterproof (allegedly)-Larger screen and better graphics-Better camera quality than ever beforeCons:-Insanely expensive-Facial recognition is not that great. It works about 70% of the time and doesn't work randomly, for unknown reasons-The processor is supposed to be faster but it is constantly lagging when using apps and I'm nowhere close to capacity-With the home button gone, you have to swipe up from the bottom to close apps. This is problematic when using certain apps because I often inadvertently swipe up (when playing a game, for instance) and close the app-The battery life is supposed to be better than previous models, however I don't notice a difference. The phone also takes a bit longer to fully charge	0

A deformation is not really visible on the photo and certainly not the reason for the error, which is why I have asked the support for a recall and made my objections. The employee told me that Apple always repairs ALL errors of a device and one (which? ?) Deformation is accidental damage, which is why the warranty is not given.

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Alex1282	1	the service...	2016-10-10	de	The iPhone 7 has actually earned 4 to 5 stars, this has been written a lot. However, for me is also a good service for a € 870 mobile phone and Apple can no longer deliver. I had problems with my iPhone and went directly to the Apple service. The error could not be solved even after 3 complaints. The service seemed incompetent and dried up. Again and again, the same phrases of the employees used, without a solution to bring about. Consumer rights regarding the warranty for defects under German law were eroded and ignored. The Apple warranty is a priority, even if I would be better off under the warranty. This is very alarming, as a group over the law and law sets. As I was then more and more acidic by the ignorance of the concrete personnel, one has noticed correctly how the employees have the invisible arrogant "" Apple coat "" dressed and no longer argued goal-oriented. Granted, I was a little upset, too, but rightly so. I never became dropping, offensive or personal. With which arrogance but it has to do with a non-functioning 870 ¬ phone at Apple, is absurd and no longer of this world. By the way, was exactly this service at Apple a few years ago, still exemplary. Today, this is often sluggish and bureaucratized. If Apple does not change here soon with the amount of staff and especially well-trained (professional, non-religious;)) professionals, the case will probably deep in the medium to long term, because then lacks the backing in the fan base, the Apple still has today. One should hire more IT people in the service and no theologians;)	0

Super part of this part can tell me when I have to move, can me with one or the other hardware from Apple my pulse Announcements, can pay with it & in two years it will probably breathe and revive people. It puts every value on other things, but that Apple sells smartphones for this price, which does not even trivialities (transfer pictures, download one or the other) without the 30 tutorials and 12 apps must load is worthless in my opinion! I am disappointed that this mega-group is going to lift such a hype for something that is not worth a penny more than any other mobile phone! Nice that this thing can play so much future music, but fails with the simplest things!

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	RUBIMAX.fr	3	For your health, limit the use of GAFAM!	2018-03-24	fr	But good when we develop software for pro and must work on any type of support, and that the fan of Apple are so whew in their head that they can offer you old models iphone + 500 € second-hand, bah we add a few hundred euros and at least we have the last iphone blablabla, then it goes well in customers .... (pfff poor planet ...) But let's be realistic, even if the product is beautiful and that the quality is there: it's not worth that price! The battery life is to die of laughter compared to my Nokia Lumia that easily holds 3 days, this iphone without doing anything special in the day is 50% his battery in the late evening ... I found some freeze in some settings which surprised me since saying that their machin-BSD like is so effective that it never happens blah blah ... Also what is awful it's the reliance of Apple's services, it would be nice to stop put handcuffs like that (icloud among others) I still managed to completely disable the icloud service, but there are actions to do to disable all that ... Good in the end: I needed an iphone for the work, not for the fad, and I'm still happy with it.	0

iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Anonymus	1	Top smartphone, gruesome phone, performance strange	2019-07-04	de	I try to keep it short and sweet. The smartphone itself is great. Valuable processed. Display on my part completely sufficient, performance impeccable and service also great. I come from the Galaxy S8 myself and was a little disappointed with Samsung's battery packs as well as the abysmal update policy even on Google's Pixel phones. But why am I going to pull a shipping sticker to return the cellphone from Amazon? Permanently comes a jerky, loud Schmatzgeräusch. This is only noticeable on my side, regardless of VoLTE and occurs only on phone calls and not on Whatsapp or Facetime. My interlocutor does not hear anything. The basic function of the phone does not work, that's just not to understand for me in such an expensive device. Repeated full reset without backup did not solve the problem. Other sim no solution. If one searches "" Iphone X / XR / XS Crack "" one finds also some threads both in Germany as well as with linking in the USA where the problem is described and also Youtube videos exist. So it is not an isolated case and repeated exchanges are described there as unhelpful. The Apple support itself knows except "" ... give it in the repair "" no advice. Furthermore, a significant stuttering or judder is noted when Apps are re-opened and you scroll in a newly opened menu item. This affects Whatsapp, DB App, Instagram, settings, images ... speak it is not specific to the app but overall. Here, too, search for iphone stutter and you will find plenty. Update: Exchange device knows at least so far no pop / smack or jerks when telephoning. Will show if this remains so. A relatively loud background noise remains. The Iphone6 ​​or Samsung S8 is completely quiet in comparison, both when not said and when spoken. Luck or stutter when scrolling through newly opened pages (contact list, Whatsappchat, Instagram, settings list ...) still available. Supposedly IOS13 should run better in the beta but honestly, I would not like to test it out now and should be half a year after release sowas already solved.Update 2: Ploppgeräusche are synonymous with the replacement device with Vodafone, Otelo and Telekomsimkarte. I'm sorry but there I grab my head and evaluate another star.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Lars Wisotzky	2	Phone is okay, iOS for me an absurdity	2018-08-19	de	My first IPhone, provided by the company. With, it was clear that it would be a change. But I did not expect that much regression. After 4 months, my impression does not improve. Especially since the operating system is inflexible, inconsistent and not very user friendly. And that's what most Apple users did. The keyboard of Apple zb. Is inaccurate, makes less clever correction suggestions, special characters only with switch. This can be done better. Siri, well. Acts somehow like beginnings of assistance. Back Button is on the top left, often swipes (but not always) and other apps is built back down somewhere. Experience with Amazon Music: Music download in the app is blocked by Apple. Well, congratulations. Furthermore, I notice that inapp purchases are often more expensive than Android. Myibidder costs nothing on Android per bid, with Apple 50 cents !!! To the phone: basically the hardware succeeded. Display good, camera very good (the shots with weak light are bad). Face recognition good, annoying in the car holder. Banking release with face recognition great. Battery okay to very good. Sometimes empty, sometimes it lasts forever. Wireless charging works great and is convenient. My conclusion: who uses and likes assistance systems is wrong here. There are many restrictions associated with the phone. If you like the Apple world is certainly well served with the hardware.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Marco	1	Apple has served its time	2016-10-24	de	I was actually a happy Apple user. Had always IPhones, MacBooks and IPads. Above all the reliability and stability of the software as well as the optimal software tuning on the hardware let me buy again and again a new Apple product despite the clearly higher price compared to competing products. Also, the compatibility of the profucts was very good. In the meantime, I have bought laptops and smartphones from other manufacturers with the software Windows and Android, due to a significantly better price-performance ratio, but I am always returned to Apple products mainly due to the simple and reliable condition. After I had the iPhone 6S exactly 1 year, started several massive problems at the same time. The iPhone 6S crashes completely for no reason despite the simplest applications. It always switches off at a battery charge of 20 - 40% and goes on (if at all) only briefly for a few seconds again. The software is of course always up to date. Resolutions did not solve any of the problems mentioned. Also, I exclude a misuse and handling of battery or charging. What a coincidence that these problems exactly 1 year after the purchase of the product (840 € im Apple Store) while Apple is still as good as all other electronics manufacturers ONLY 1 year warranty on its products instead of the usual 2-year warranty, as practiced even by the cheapest no-name manufacturers. A rogue who thinks of planned obsolescence? I will not now as planned, the new IPhone 7 grow and buy no other iPhone. There are some alternatives and fortunately I am not "brand fixed" which makes me open to all manufacturers. Recommend everyone to do the same, because as we know: "" Competition gives wings to the market "".	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Dinin70	2	Unjustified price ...	2018-07-05	fr	Purchase not checked because received for work.Les plus: - it is pretty-the screen is very beautiful, nothing to complain about. The colors are vivid.- excellent reactivity of the screen. But nothing transcendent, any smartphone half the price has the same responsiveness / fluidity - the battery is long. Two and a half days in high use but no games.- sync mails / outlook / contacts less broken head than on Android.- excellent camera.Level of flat keys: - no micro SD- no button. Extreme slowness at the level of manipulation. We want to close an application? Press for a long time at the bottom of the screen, long press on the window, wait until the small red crosses appear, close one by one applications.- without buttons it is also necessary to do additional manipulations to navigate from an application to the other, to go back on a web page etc.- nice facial recognition but if it does not work (glasses), you have to wait until recognition does not work, wait to put the code etc ...- obligation to go through iTunes to listen to music.- headphones without jack cable. So you have to either discard the iPhone headphones and use the jack cable adapter to iPhone, or have two pairs, one for the iPhone, one for the computer ... To conclude, the battery, the screen and the camera is really at the top, but tedious navigation (what is faster to do anything on an Android ...), the headphones unusable other than on the phone, and the lack of flexibility at the level of music and storage make the price is absolutely not justified and is there only to give some exclusivity to its owner, which is ridiculous.Je have not had other phones too high-end but I'm certain that for € 3-400 less (which is extremely expensive) you can enjoy the same quality without having to suffer the limitations imposed by Apple	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Sivan A.	3	Either I'm pretty unlucky, or Apple can not build mobile phones anymore!	2018-01-13	de	It's just amazing. At the beginning of December, after three years of using an iPhone 5, I bought the new iPhone 8. I looked forward to it so animalically, and felt emotions during unboxing, which I had never had before! I was completely satisfied and set up the device. As stupid as I was, I did not pay attention to the outside ... Only the next day, I noticed processing errors on the device. The gaps between glass and aluminum frame on the back were quite large. On the sides they were o. K., But above all a clear gap was felt. I then made use of my right of withdrawal and returned the device. Then I ordered it elsewhere, because it was cheaper there ... Also, this device had similar errors. The gap dimensions were not quite as big now. On top of that, however, the mute switch rattled quite a bit when he was in the top position. I sent it to Apple this time because I thought they would know what to do. But then came the disappointment: they simply sent the device back to me unprocessed. Was added a remark that the device is flawless. But that was not it. I then researched the Internet, and found that other iPhone eight models have this gap. However, I also had an iPhone 8 Plus in my hand, which did not have these problems. Also the problems with the mute switch had two devices that I did not have in my hand. I then really tried to live with these annoying problems, and to accept the whole thing. Now comes to the fact that I noticed now after a few weeks of use, that in the video recording with the main camera a crack in the sound can be heard. But this has only occurred now, in the beginning this was not heard in video recordings. I do not know what to think about it. Apple did not do anything, and now I'm sitting here with this faulty device. It's fast and looks fancy. You have to leave that to him, but somehow I wish I had never switched to the iPhone 8.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Boris	1	Rather a status symbol than a workhorse	2017-05-28	de	I wanted to get my age rather mature iPhone 4s replace a newer model. Since I use a MacBook to work with the usual compatibility among the devices was very important. So a new iPhone had to come from. Meanwhile, I use the new phone for about 4 months. Positive: -optimal display size-Touch ID is very handy for unlocking the screen-waterproof housing-a pretty good camera-the system runs very fast (although the difference to 4s but not so enormous is as I have imagined) Negative: -GPS is quite inaccurate (seems to be a known problem of the 7 models) -Akka performance is not optimal. After 2 days not so intensive use (GPS, e-mail / write, surf, phone) the battery is quickly empty. Unfortunately, this is not enough for me, considering that these are standard applications and not resource-hungry games. Unfortunately, older headphones can only be connected via an adapter. Conclusion: With the iPhone 7, you get a modern but extremely overpriced device, that with scores some features but also has some weaknesses. As far as the price performance is concerned, the cell phone did not convince me. Although I can understand that one pays the brand name here. But with the price level you expect something more. And the difference to an older model like the 4s (built in 2012) is not that huge. If you are not dependent on Apple products and do not necessarily need a mobile phone as a status symbol, you will be better off with much cheaper Android phones. # Update 2018 #After over 1.5 years, the phone is completely greased. The display simply went off, since then failed all revival attempts. According to the report, there is a hardware defect. Something I did not expect Apple device now! The Amazon Marketplace seller CVV is no longer responsive after the return. The money is gone!	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Malabulaba	1	Excessively overrated product with many disadvantages	2019-01-04	de	For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Use only if the phone with the display is up on the table Warranty / Guarantee: The iPhone XS is indeed high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Apple gives on its products generally only 12 months Manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the price policy actually almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone from the top My rating of one star refers exclusively to the criticisms mentioned above.Note: Factual comments I am willing to answer, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and not with criticism to be able to deal with!

At full volume on the smartphone you just heard something (quietly) of music / video / call. When background noise (city / sports center) you heard even less of what is being played (Spotify, Youtube, iMusic, etc.).

iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Reynolds	3	Great phone but it WILL break.	2019-03-21	us	My first Apple product. Lots of neat features in handling like face recognition and password/login applicability.Very cumbersome with many artificial limitations doing email attachments through the mail application and even through the gmail app.Casing is HORRENDOUS. Looks cool for 4 days but is so slick and slippery that both cases on my phone and my wife’s phone shattered within 5 days. It will slide off your bed/counter/desk/out of your pocket/everything. Apple chose to make the case out of cheap glass. You will live in a state of anxiety given that the included cord is too short for practical use and is still heavy enough to pull the phone off its surface and to the floor several times a day regardless of the precautions you take.	0

Now comes the BUT, the battery leaves much to be desired. Already on the first day it turned off several times and indicated that the battery is empty although he still had at least 70%. After that, I was mad. However, it was strangely only when the phone was out in the cold for a long time. (When taking a photo etc.). Of course, that may not be synonymous ok but because of minus temperatures we currently have .. Well .. As soon as the phone but then again inside it had no more problems and worked flawlessly. I give the phone a little bit of time now vl just warned me of start-up problems and otherwise I'll send it back anyway !!!	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Nadine Laabs	1	SCAM! No new product! Warranty expired!	2018-09-15	de	Attention FRAUD! Seller: TI-Trade, purchase June 2018Ware was delivered quickly, 1. Delivery was defective from the outset, exchange was smooth. The second iPhone, which was delivered seemed to be in commissioning once in order. After four weeks of use, however, showed a defect in the microphone, caller could not understand me despite good cell phone reception suddenly; When playing back videos recorded with the front camera, you could hear noise. I've come to an Apple retailer to claim the 12-month warranty that's usually available on new equipment from the first activation. Based on the serial number was first checked whether the device is still eligible for warranty and to my horror was found that this had already expired. The device was already over 1 1/2 years old, so had no claim to warranty, but was welded sold as new. That's cheating! So I reset the device to factory settings, returned it and demanded my money back. It took a long time until the return was processed despite repeated requests, then the seller said, I did not disable the "iPhone Search" feature and he would now need my Apple ID and password. Haha! Luckily that could be done from a distance (without giving any passwords) and now, after three months back and forth, I finally got my money back. The whole thing has cost me a lot of time and nerves, countless e-mails had to be written and I did not get my money for three months (almost 500 €). I can only warn against a purchase!	0

iPhone 6S	128GB	Space Grey	alan carruthers	2	"Phone looks good, no battery life"	2018-06-23	uk	My phone was delivered promptly and packaged as described. The package contained all the items I expected. Superficially the phone is in very good condition indeed. I cannot see any marks or flaws at all. Regrettably the battery life is shockingly poor. New to me on an i phone there is information on battery performance and this phone arrived with 78%, this was its optimum performance capability. In reality that means I am getting less than two hours usage between charges which is not good by any standard, given this is a refurbished phone it would have been useful for such vital information to be included in the advert. I am now forced to obtain a new battery which makes the initially attractive cost of this phone greater than I had hoped. An almost perfect product ruined through lack of information by the seller.	0
iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	MG	1	The weaknesses of the iPhone reveal themselves in detail.	2019-01-19	de	Well, I'll try to make it short. I owned the following iPhones: 3GS, 4S, 6, 6s, 7 plus and this one here, which will be the end of the journey in the Apple Cosmos. Incidentally, I use an iPad and a MacBook Pro. I do not want to go into the technical specs, which is easier to read on technical pages. For me, it's about the shortcomings of this rigid and now completely unthinkable operating system. What used to be advanced is now dusty and regressive. Some details: Siri, totally useless - "Siri navigate me home" Siri: "here is home address: street name" She does not provide the simplest things Shortcuts, the new Apple app as an automator replacement for the iOS is just laughable. 4 useful shortcuts are available, everything else is not possible due to the restrictions. The settings are now scattered completely confused: automatic brightness of the screen is not found in the screen control / brightness, but under a submenu 30 kilometers away, because of Apple is intuitive. Nevertheless, iTunes is the basis for synchronistation on the mac and on the pc, the old Romans have already used it, and even they were already annoyed by it.Landscape mode does not work well and takes a lot on most apps unnecessarily Place away - completely embarrassing support of the top models. (Not xs related) Hand off (model overarching work) works completely unreliable, sometimes not for weeks, then again. Any individualization of the operating system is impossible. Turn off wifi does not mean: wifi off. Price is now unacceptable, even if the value stability Well, I could go on forever ... and that's why it will probably in the future, which is still far, a leak out of the entire Apple cosmos mean. Certain things are just too much of a good thing. Can others do better? Let's see .. but the most basic things you should already be able to trust the almost most valuable company in the world at this time - but this seems clearly too much to ask.	0

The 30 € to save compared to the store price, it was not worth it. Note: For returns on Amazon over 500 ¬ you have to make a sworn statement so you get the credit.

iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	FcBayernGrafBecker	1	Ugly, cheap and itunes heavy!	2015-10-18	de	Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!	0
iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Chr	1	Apple is the last junk	2018-04-17	de	If you could express the word police state with a cell phone, it would be the iPhone 7. As usual Apple not many customization options. A fingerprint sensor, and to the blast and probably the biggest selling point on the phone: A home button where you can set the minimum fineness, woow! What a senseless hipster shit. I would knock this drecks cell phone in the bin, if it were not my company phone ... The missing AUX connection is a joke. You need the annoying iTunes on the PC to download music to the phone. The power is supplied by something you once again only found in Apple, which is why it is not so easy to borrow from a colleague the charging cable. The phone does not seem very sturdy.	0

The new Mac High Sierra and IOS 11 operating systems for itune and iphone are real viruses for your devices over 2 years old! In addition, Apple Care is recruiting a team that has no technical skills to help you solve your problems. problems and will not offer you especially any commercial solution! "" Normal "" will you say, this is precisely their new branding strategy! The planned obsolescence of Apple products is a reality that I have refused to see until it impacts me directly. I am writing this post to prevent others from throwing their money out the window . I have an iphone 6 plus a Mac Book Air and a Super Drive (external DVD player). I had 2 weeks ago the unfortunate act of updating my iphone which worked perfectly on IOS 10 to IOS 11.2.5. Since my phone is less responsive than the one I owned 10 years ago. The applications take looooooooooyear seconds to open, take a photo quickly is impossible, sent a message remains possible if you are not disturbed by the fact that it appears only after you have typed 10 Phrases.I contact the assistance Apple (the story is abbreviated because it took me 9 calls of 2h including 1h systematic waiting, spread over 2 weeks, to obtain the poor result that I will describe you): The assistance tells me to restore my iphone to fix the problems. To do this, an update of itune is necessary, but in order to achieve the update of itune I must first update the operating system of my Mac because none of the sytems were compatible between them. I'm running (with you imagine it much trouble because nothing works as indicated by employees of Apple). After several nights of updates, my iphone is finally restored and all my systems are up to date. ... Finding: My iphone is still slow and my Mac on the latest version High Sierra no longer recognizes my Super Drive (which can not be updated) .I spend my last night on the phone with Apple who does not offers no solution and hangs up leaving me in total disarray (I forgot to mention that my interlocutors have all tried to charge me their package of assistance for products no longer under warranty). To conclude, Si you do not want to spend 800 to 2500 euros for a phone or computer every two years and buy accessories at an exorbitant price that become obsolete after 6 months ... FUY !!!!!! Any other smartphone provider is doing better than Apple now! Apple, I hope this post will continue to complete your reputation so that others do not get caught up in your vast scam. The only time I will lose with you now will be the one I need to propagate this message as widely as possible.KindlyAn ex-consumer.	0

Amazon Kunde	1	back again	2018-02-01	de	I have an Ipad, I am very happy with that, but the Iphone, no! we are now living in the 21st century, and just because it's apple ??? my apps, which I bought for my Android, are not transferable! You have to pay again! Great! 1 slot !! That's a joke! On my Android device I have 2 slots, for business and home, plus a slot for a memory card! Ok, apple has an adapter, of course, everything costs extra, and the iphone anyway almost 3 times as expensive as the Android .... etc. etc.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	NS	1	Received scratched	2019-02-19	it	I think it is unacceptable to pay a similar price and find yourself a scratched product even before using a new item. Quality control equal to zero.And the most absurd thing is that it is not the first time that strange / heavy inconveniences happen to me, unfortunately lately the quality level of the products on this e-commerce has dropped by a lot. The choice of certain couriers then it accentuates the deterioration, in fact I gave up and abandoned even my Prime subscription, in addition to buying much less since then you are necessarily obliged to return, finding yourself being called back, unjustly. I hope, for all of us, to be just randomness and not other.	0

iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Frank Haack	1	Bad customer service - expensive repair	2018-03-08	de	Since everything has already been said about the Iphone x, I would like to write something about the "" after "". After my Iphone x fell to the floor and the display jumped, I was in the GRAVIS store. A friendly colleague told me that he has not seen many Iphone X yet and he can not tell me if maybe a sensor or something similar has broken down and recommended that I go elsewhere! I then got the Apple Care Number (0800 ...) called, there they tell me for 4 days now that within a radius of 150 km around my place of residence in the next 8 days no more appointments are free. For more than 8 days, employees can not schedule appointments (in 2018). I was therefore advised to call early each morning and hope that I get an appointment somewhere. The repair of the display costs the way 320.00 €, which should be considered when buying synonymous! I will now sell my broken Iphone X on Ebay and buy a SAMSUNG phone again. Unfortunately my move to Apple was not a good idea.	0
iPhone XR	64GB	Black	ein kunde aus düsseldorf	3	I was forced	2019-06-01	de	As a long-time satisfied user of Asian budget smartphones, I was forced by my employer to buy this device due to "changed mobile standards". Dual SIM had to be on hold. Compared to my last cell phone, an almost historic Honor 4x, the much better Kamara and the very fluently running software stand out positively. Negative is the fairly high weight and - for me serious - miserable dictation function. Professionally, I am forced to dictate extensive texts in the worst specialist gibberish, which was not a problem at all with the Honor - and a Samsung Tablet used for comparison - quasi out of box. Unfortunately, the expensive iPhone only produces absolute garbage. Everyday language, of course also garnished with elements from the consumer and media world, runs great. At the moment I'm hoping for the system's ability to learn, but I'm skeptical.	0

iPhone 6S	128GB	Space Gray	Vijfcent	2	bad reception	2015-10-22	de	I am getting black right now. In the Apple Store, I ordered the iPhone 6S 128GB and put it into operation today. I use O2 Multicard and of course I have the old iPhone 4s lying next to the improvements directly to see. All fine; 3D touch, Retina display and of course a lot of nice gimmicks. The mobile reception is very sobering; Both iPhones have the decibel indicator (iPhone Field test) set up, and the age-old bone has a paltry 20dB better reception (see picture). The crucial difference between being able to make calls or not. I have been extra waiting for the "" s "" model since in this case most of the negative aspects have been improved. Of course, I have created similar circumstances. Comparable settings (mobile data on / off), both devices with / without case, etc. do not understand me wrong; I do not want to miss my iFuhrpark anymore, but dear hardware manufacturers (and I mean all of them), please make phones again with the phone is also possible again. € 1000, - for a gadget that scolds phone and can not talk on the phone is not OK	0

Data security also plays a role, but who knows ... I need a lot of the phone camera. This is clearly worse at Apple. At 35% battery charge and cold weather, the phone turns off after each photo. The 6S has to be loaded every day although I do not run any games, call or mile much. With Windowsphone the charge lasted 3 days.	0

iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Gray	May Jay	1	Speaker is very bad and after 6 months the battery is dead	2018-08-09	de	I needed an iPhone for work. Almost 240 € for an alleged exhibit I find really expensive, but I thought, then at least I get a well-functioning model. Unfortunately, one hardly hears me, when talking on the phone. It only works via loudspeaker or headset. This is really poor, since it is after all a telephone. The camera is really great and fun to shoot and take pictures with. Except for the bad speaker, I'm so satisfied. Even though I do not think the device was an exhibit. It looks more like used and badly repaired. If I had a replacement, I would have sent it back immediately. Next time I use another provider.6 months after the purchase, I can not use the device because the battery is no longer charged. Within 4 weeks, the performance decreased rapidly and in the end, I was not even allowed to remove it from the charging station because otherwise it would have gone out immediately. Now it is not even more. What else should I say? I wish I had invested the money elsewhere. That was a sad and expensive experience.	0

At 200-300 € there are android terminals that allow the user to do many more things, they are more versatile and above all they have an o.s. which has much less bugs than iOS (which carries the same problems from the 7.0 to the present day, absurd).

iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Marc Noack	2	Good but bad ...	2019-01-02	de	A good device, but I still forgive only two stars. I bought the iPhone in December 2017, so it has now "tested" a good one year. I think on the basic materials and on the software, I do not have eingehen.Was the quality Furthermore, the fact that iPhone scratched extremely fast, especially the frame, which is why I use an armored film and a protective cover, does not look sooo good, but otherwise the iPhone would not look good long. What the price / delivery / quality concernsThe iPhone cost 1,149 Euro and that's really hard. The package is nothing special included, I would have liked an alternative to the wired headphones in particular. In Decmeber 2018 it was time, the touch screen made great problems, hardly responded. From the next Apple authorized dealer, matching the problem, Apple has just launched a recall, waiting for the repair 1 month, there is no loaner. So you buy a premium product and then the service is, well ... If you now compare the iPhone with the Huawei P20 Pro (which costs less than half), the question is "what exactly is so much better on the iPhone now, what makes the enormous higher price? ". I can not answer this question, because other phones are at least as good. So the iPhone X is a good phone, but it is not better than others and it is worth the extra price by no means. For me it is therefore the last Apple product I bought, because I do not want to support this exaggeration.	0

So it is going back. Very disappointed in Apple, I thought that their product quality was one thing you could depend on! I was switching back to Apple as I couldn't get on with Android (Samsung).  So where do I go now?  Maybe I will just get a dumb-phone (Nokia) - I used to like the one I had in the 90s.	0

We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap!

A call to the Apple service line confirmed that fact, more than that, the warranty expired more than 2 years ago and the device was designed for the US market, making repairs extremely expensive and complicated. A complete sham package! I can only recommend to anyone here: Stay away from this seller! The phone itself would have been functional, the battery life but still under any criticism.

iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Shoppingphantom	2	Not as good as the 6s	2019-07-09	de	I've been using iPhones 3, 5, 6s, and now 8, which I did not buy from Amazon for years. But I think the Amazon is the best 'consumer channel' for a review. I've been using the phone for about half a year, and basically it's still a great smartphone but not as good as the 6s. But there are a few points that are really annoying: - The missing headphone input. Of course, there is a matching headphone and an adapter with it, so that especially perfectly organized people have no problem with it. Unfortunately, I can not bite, and of my many headphones fits now only one, and that, who is currently not there, and the adapter, I also constantly misplaced.- The GPS reception in the car is not working properly. It sometimes takes minutes for the phone to hear that I've turned off. It is probably a common problem with the reception, which is discussed on communities, I had so far only time to worry about it and have no solution- The new home button is also getting used to. He has no more resistance than at the 6s and often he just does not react. One presses desperately repeatedly until something happens.We still wonder that sales of iPhones is weakening. Perhaps Apple executives should increasingly think about whether they are acting in the interests of their customers. Incidentally, this also applies to the further development of iOS. Personally, I would wish for many features and Apple apps, the aspect of simple and straightforward usability back into focus. The two stars explicitly include the comparison with the previous one.	0

Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Amazon Customer	1	Robbed me	2019-06-09	de	The phone was nice at first. Didn’t like that it didn’t come with headphones but I knew that was going to be the case. It had some dents in it already when I got it which wasn’t the end of the world. But then after a few months the phone randomly overheated and the camera and flashlight stopped working. I tried to return or exchange it which they were willing to do but now it has been over two months since I sent the phone back and I haven’t received a fixed phone or my money back. Now I’m out a phone and a few hundred Euros! Avoid these guys!	0

My daughter was already a few weeks ago at the Apple Store in Munich, they have looked at the phone, but unfortunately could not fix it. That can happen.

iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Uwe P	2	Bad reception in the GSM area	2017-03-22	de	Actually, the iPhone 7 should replace my iPhone 4S. But unfortunately, nothing came of it. The device went back to Amazon today. Because of the miserable reception in the GSM area. (D2 network Vodafone with me). I live in an area with unfortunately weak mobile network expansion. Where I have with the 4S 2 reception bar, it fluctuates with the iPhone 7 between network search and 1 reception bar. Telephone calls without disconnection are unfortunately hardly possible with the iPhone 7 here. After more than 1 hour of extensive consultation and some checks with the Apple Support, the recommendation was made to send the device back. Since the technical checks of the support could not detect a fault with the device, it seems A reception increase by future software updates is unlikely and I can not guarantee synonymous Apple, so returns. In areas with weak network expansion, I can not recommend the iPhone 7! Where a good network expansion It may work. I have now ordered a 6S, which, according to Apple Support, should not have the problems.	0
iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Anthony	1	The loss of time and money is real	2018-10-10	fr	Hello, I usually do not write bad reviews in my life in general.

So I forwarded the item back and asked for a refund, Amazon told me that the refund may take several weeks !!!! (Nothing to do with the 2 to 3 worked cheeks information). Instead of making an exchange I had to, if not have a phone, recommended 1, or a total of 1560 €! We are on October 10th, one month after the receipt of my return and I am still not reimbursed.

iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	Luka	2	Works, like all others and more just not.	2018-12-03	de	OK, all in all. I had a Huawei P20 Pro in direct comparison and I have to say that Huawei makes much better photos especially the front camera. What I really want to criticize is the price is by no means worth justifying the device's regular lags, the camera is no better than the Huawei devices. Quick charger must be purchased seprat. AUX adapter is not included. I will sell this smartphone again and get the Huawei P20 Pro. Because of the audacity of Apple nothing to do for his customers and because of the better price-performance ratio. Conclusion after 4 weeks: Face ID does not recognize my face, face can not be reconfigured ... I'm glad if the part is gone .. ,	0

iPhone 8	256GB	Space Gray	A.D.	1	Not so good.	2018-10-05	de	Not so good! Have the iphone since March and am shocked how sensitive it is against scratches and cracks in the display and housing. Without a protective cover it should probably never be used. Software is also weak, the preinstalled card app ranges e.g. I do not need any additional apps from the competition. Very little compatibility with other products, sometimes even with those that should be made especially for Apple. Photos of the camera are in good light very good, in low light quite bad. With the standard camera app hardly any settings possible. I will hardly buy an expensive second camera app. Why are not photos taken the same size as the display? There are always edges, with videos it fits. In the beginning, wiping across the screen did not always work properly, which only got better after an update. Actually, I like the device only the performance, until now it runs smoothly and fast. There is just one star. There are deductions for the price, which is far too high. Trigger for the sensitivity. Deduction for software errors that the support will fix late or not. Fingerprint sensor does not work on slightly sweaty or wet fingers. I've read the same finger three times, now it's okay. In advertising, the man drove his skateboard through the lawn sprinkler, in reality, he would not get it unlocked ..... I'll stop writing, otherwise it will be too long.	0

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Kyoshi	4	Not revolutionary but a good smartphone anyway	2017-10-10	fr	A good smartphone but nothing revolutionary.That's the summary of reviews in general.So ... Not where to start? Often considered a simple evolution of the iPhone 7 (aesthetic very close except the glass back of the latest model), the iPhone 8 brings a few changes: - Faster (thanks to the A11 chip) - Better photo processing (you will find several tests on the net) - Compatible with the Qi charge ... And this is the novelty. Indeed, you can now charge the iPhone by putting it on a charger Qi ... No need to connect the iPhone.The nice thing also is that the memory capacity starts at 64gb (64gb or 256gb in fact). ... Despite this little change, the iPhone 8 (Plus) is a very good phone and we find the qualities of the brand.The screen is very good, the overall finish is very good, powerful and made beautiful photos (Obviously ... Accustomed to SLR ... Difficult to judge a smartphone on it ... But to troubleshoot, I find it convenient). Autonomy is good from the comparisons that we find ... Sorry ... I do not buy an array of Smartphone to compare:) ... Although I am amazed at the autonomy of my Samsung A5 2016 job that I only charge twice in the week (except for Cisco Spark and checking mails ... The use is only by telephone). Speaking of battery life ... The battery capacity is down compared to the iPhone 7 but it is obviously inconsequential ... Good ... For those who know the developments Apple, you will know that there is more to jack jacks (but the adapter is provided ... note that it can not be used wired). Several other brands have followed the movement ... Even Google who have made fun of Apple on this point ... By cons ... the iPhone 8 Plus is a heavyweight office compared to its competitors.If I compare the iPhone 8 Plus (offered to my wife) and my OnePlus 3T ... We feel the difference.Why so few changes? Just because of the iPhone X that will be released soon to write these lines.Quelles differences? Here is what I selected (in favor of the iPhone X of course): - Better screen resolution - Screen that occupies the entire surface before (or almost) - Facial identification.A still note for this last point, what the facial recognition of the iPhone X has nothing to do with that of the last Samsung that you can unlock with a simple photo (bravo security). Indeed, if I do not say nonsense, he There are 30000 IR control points on the iPhone X ... So, if you are in the dark, you put glasses or change your cuts, it will work (theoretically for now ... seen apart at the Keynote where we saw it in action ... And again ... There was a loupé ...). So ... Buy or not this iPhone 8 (Plus)? Ben ... Clearly, if you already have an iPhone 7 (More) ... The interest is minimalThe Smartphone is very expensive ... Damn ... 900 € !!! Well ... It is true that given the time that people spend above ... It's prorated more profitable than a lot of other things.The Smartphone remains a recurring budget for more and more people.The real question will remain ... iOS (the Apple system) or Android (a huge choice and for all budgets)? These are two different philosophies ... For my part, we chose an iPhone (and more specifically iOS) when: - we want to be quiet with a stable system - we want a smartphone turnkey without having to search right and left this or that application - we want to keep a system up to date (with Apple, when a new version of iOS comes out ... The update is available on all iPhone versions at the same time time...Except for the models of 5 years ago) - it does not necessarily hack his phone (easier on Android). I have the following iPhones: EDGE / 3GS / 5 / 5S and my wife the 4 or the 4S.This works ... Never had any particular problem (small bugs exist but it is rare and does not last) .Good, the only thing that can be boring is that we do not really feel to change the phone from one iPhone to the other. There are of course several improvements systems, etc ... A better responsiveness and everything ... But the system itself remains the same.On may be trying to go elsewhere ... But we are not necessarily conquered elsewhere ... My wife went on a OnePlus One after her iPhone ... She is not a fan of Android at all (and the phone has made the soul so good ). It has chained a number of problems ... Two trips / return service ... And more ... Just after the last service, the phone still has a problem ... But since the guarantee was passed and obviously at OnePlus they do not guarantee their repair (which had just been realized ... Two weeks ready) ... Not wanting to fight any longer.She is happy to have an iPhone again.My ... After my iPhone 5S, I went to Android with a OnePlus 3T.Pourquoi? Because of the price ... Do not hide the face.Some things irritated me on Android (to manage several mails ... A pleasant and free client ... Apart from BlueMail who did not always recover my mails automatically ... Pay to have a calendar in CalDAV while it is native on an iPhone, etc ...) but I'm not disappointed either. It's nice to be able for example to manage its downloads as if you were on your computer ... Or to add music without going through an application ... Have dual SIM (to manage the SIM card of work and that perso), etc.I will definitely go back to iOS for my next phone.That's my opinion ... :)	0

iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	David	4	Read the description carefully	2019-01-03	us	I bought this iPhone before they changed the title and added [Locked to SimpleMobile]. The title exclusively said (unlocked) so I purchased this expecting an unlocked device.On arrival I unboxed the phone, the box was not open or damaged so it was a pretty decent experience. The trouble started when I put my T-Mobile SIM card in only to get the invalid SIM card message. I couldn’t get to the home screen or anything.I went back to Amazon to closely inspect the description, and sure enough at the very very bottom it said it was locked to SimpleMobile. No surprise here, but it was strongly misleading when the title stated it was UNLOCKED (hence why they finally changed the title now).But besides that it’s a brand new phone, no other complaints. Comes with all the original accessories. Only word of advice next time is to read the entire description carefully (at least skim it over)	0

The Touch ID was definitely more practical, I hope they find a way to reinstate it.	0

iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	Nam D.	1	Is the iPhone worth the money?	2018-12-14	de	Wondering if it's worth spending so much on an iPhone XS? No!!! I am an Apple user myself and have a MacBookPro and an iPhone. I still tolerated it on the MacBookPro, but not on the iPhone XS at all. It's already as expensive as the MacBook Air, which can do more ... processing or not ... the iPhone is a cell phone and has no 4GB of RAM / RAM. I think nothing of the internal memory, which can be up to 512GB. One does not use the mobile phone for 10 years, in order to use so much. No app eats up so much memory and you could not enjoy it either. I would rather wait until the iPhone is downgraded to a reasonable price that you can afford. If you want to buy a € 1,000 + cell phone, ask yourself what you want to do with it. If you just want an expensive cell phone that looks and is processed well, buy it. If you want to have a status icon that shows you can afford expensive things, the phone would be ideal. If you use a mobile phone to play, talk on the phone, chat and watch movies, you should wait at least 1 year or look for another phone. At a price of 800 € or max 900 €, I could understand it (I would always not yet worth it).	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	ML	1	New iPhone defective - problems with the battery charge	2019-04-07	de	Premium Price - Premium Product? Unfortunately no.My new iPhone XS 256GB, freshly unpacked, charges the battery only sporadically. The Lightning connection often has to be put in and out several times, it's just a matter of luck. Overnight, the battery was e.g. only about half charged and then the battery charge was interrupted with the Lightning charger plugged in. With another out and reinstecken it went on. For a smartphone beyond the 1000 € an imposition. I was with the device at the Apple dealer site, there the problem was also recognized. On-site software updates were performed, smartphone reset, restarted - nothing helps. It was offered to send the 2-day-old iPhone for repair - I refused and made use of the right of withdrawal. After a short googling that does not seem to be an isolated case.	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	Abe Addler	1	No Manual Functions on Video Camera	2018-10-29	us	I got the iPhone XS and returned it 3 hrs. later. I'm a filmmaker by trade and thought this could be a breakthrough in filmmaking especially with a high-end 4k camera on board. I got the phone home anxiously opened it up and went to the camera functions right away since that's all I care about, a phone is just a phone otherwise. Well, I shot some 4k footage, looked nice but now I need to see how creative I can get. I looked for the manual shutter speed control, there isn't one. I looked for the manual white balance, there isn't one. I looked. I looked for the manual ISO setting, not there. I looked for the manual aperture setting, doesn't have it. So basically its camera is not intended for any kind of production, it's really a point and shoot. The HDR feature is nice but again, no manual settings. Not production friendly at all. 3 hours later I repacked it and returned it and got the LGV40.

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Stefan80339	4	Great phone, expensive repairs, frustrating Face ID	2018-12-21	de	In principle, there is not much to say about an iPhone. Nevertheless, a few comments: - same day delivery in Munich has not worked-the first model came to a fault and did not turn on. Amazon was very fast in exchange and has already sent a replacement before I had given up the old.- Compared to the 6 or 7 model, the phone is really heavy-glass repair costs are really expensive, 591 Eur if front and back are concerned. - I do not have the home button, one-hand operation is virtually impossible - Face ID only works moderately. This one must look at the phone pretty directly. Does it not, because it is e.g. lying flat on a table or in a handsfree, then Face ID is not. Does not work on wet hair, head half in the pillow, etc. Otherwise, of course, it is a sensational phone with great camera and mega display.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	TeaLow	1	No more Apple innovation and way too expensive!	2018-10-03	de	I have now switched back to Android with a larger display. The only two positive things I liked about the iPhone X were the look and feel and the ability to sync with my other Apple devices like Mac and iPad. Otherwise, the device is just snot. Battery life is not intoxicating, I do not like the operation synonymous, the camera is not better than other, much cheaper devices. In some situations, it is even worse. I find it absolutely ridiculous, why Apple does not finally extend the camera mode times ... professional mode, new filters, etc. All wrong. At IOS, I miss so many opportunities and simplifications that I have with Android, such as Always on display, splitsreen, mirror-share or mirror-screen, fast closing of all apps, etc. For Android, my device connects to e.g. directly after switching on e.g. with my Bluetooth speaker, the iPhone can not do that and I always have to connect the device manually. What bothers me so animal is that always Bluetooth automatically turns on ... what is this shit? I would like to determine if and when I turn on Bluetooth. Did I already mention the missing fast-loading part ?! Since Steve Jobs is no longer with us, it's not really progressing any more and the new iPhones confirm that absolutely. Since one wants to let now the last loyal Apple customers bleed properly, with up to 1600 € for the new devices. Absolutely ill. I do not need to write about the endless problems with IOS and Apple hardware, you can read about it almost every week on the net. So I can only advise anyone from Apple, who would like to do something more than phone calls ... oh yes, there was not something with the reception problem ;-) And if there is now the argument ... at Apple, you get yes for years updates ... may be, but with the blatant weaknesses, I prefer to buy every 2-3 years a new Android Phone for half or a third of the price and then always have the latest software and the latest technology.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	Stefan Kretzschmar	1	Steve Jobs would turn in the grave	2016-01-23	de	I changed from the 5s to the 6s, so I'm used to Apple. What strikes me are the small nuances that creep in. This starts with the shorter battery life and continues with the scratching and shaking of the original Apple EarPod plug when I plug the device into my pocket or touch the connector. Sure, I could use my Sennheiser headphones but I do not want that and was not necessary until the 5s because the original accessories reflected a basic quality. Other nuances are the protruding camera, which does not bother me since I use an original Apple leather case. However, it represents a design carver that would have been impossible with jobs. The case shows further changes. The case no longer encloses the whole device but leaves the lower part of the speaker, Lightning and Micro open and unprotected. In addition to the fact that the two lower corners visible not as complex Complete as the old case of 5s leaves it with the overall appearance of a strange taste and makes it appear less high-quality altogether. The only thing that is still accustomed Apple is the price. In conclusion, disappointing for me. The zenith is over. Apart from my remarks, it certainly remains a solid device that its lovers will find. I do not belong anymore and will give it back despite financial loss and hope that my 5s still works.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Fireball3	1	After a year sudden device dead	2018-09-14	de	About a year ago I bought my wife an iphone 7 with 128GB. The said mobile phone looks through the careful use until today as new. Nonetheless, the phone suddenly became boiling hot (source of danger) and has stopped working since then. The warranty expired a few weeks ago - and goodwill is a foreign word at Apple. For a mobile phone that only lasts for one year and is almost injured, the price is in no way justified. We will turn our backs on Apple after this experience and get a device with better value for money - prestige is not everything in life! However, until the said day, the mobile phone has worked well, albeit no better than comparable competing products.	0

Not only did I lose 65% of all the songs I painstakingly burned and created playlists for, but the headphones end connector has changed as well .  It is non-universal so you will not be able to use the new headphones on planes or other devices like tablets or computers. The music I lost wasn’t pre-cloud.  Nevertheless, Apple Support was very nonchalant about this loss.  They say they are “pushing” all users to subscribe to Apple Music!  Shame on you, Apple!  We’re switching to another product.	0

After use, I have found that the Mute button on the side of the device has more play, until, for example. from silent to loud, as with the iPhones of my colleagues. Say it wobbles easily if you run a finger over it. After a conversation with an Apple employee, it turned out that this button should normally be rock solid and should not have a game. He also said that as long as it does not restrict functionality, that's not bad, yet a minimal assembly error. It may sound fussy, but with the price I expect 100% quality on a new device.	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Karl	1	The missing headphone jack is a K.O criterion	2017-08-09	de	I have been a big fan of Apple's iPhones since iPhone 4. My last iPhone was an iPhone 6, which I gave away about a month ago, because I received the new iPhone 7 in 256 GB with a new mobile phone contract. For all iPhone 6 converters: the switch is not really worthwhile. The camera is marginally better, the processor is probably faster, but in practice you notice nothing of it. The only other change: the missing headphone jack. This is not an improvement, but a total failure! I think about it every day about the iPhone 7 exchange. The battery lasts a day very difficult. Most of the time I have to recharge during the day. However, this leads to the fact that I always have to take a break when using, so that I can recharge. I talk a lot, listen to music or watch videos from time to time. Then I have to stop in the middle of everything and start charging the phone, because the iPhone does not last the day (with normal use). Really great is the case of calls, where I must either put on speaker or the phone must always hold my ear, because I can not use a headset when charging .. Of course, you could buy an adapter, but is that really useful ?. The provider makes the phones expensive and leaves a connection away. To make up for this, you have to buy an adapter for a lot of money and carry it along permanently, as long as the Driite provider adapter works reliably, because Apple is very rigorous. It hardly has to upgrade iPhone 6 / 6s, but it has a huge disadvantage in everyday life so noticeable that you get the push, you would buy a cell phone for 30 ¬, in fact it is just under 1000 €. Apparently, Apple does not think about that ... I am definitely disappointed for the first time in a long time.	0

iPhone 6S	128GB	Space Gray	Pfeiffer	3	Fast smartphone, unfortunately very unreliable	2017-01-29	de	Basically, the phone does almost everything it should do. However, the iPhone has problems with a headset, even the original. It just happens regularly that I do not understand people and they do not understand me when I talk to them. Then it only helps a complete reboot, which makes the phone slower and more uncomfortable than any other smartphone. No idea how to afford such aberrations and still be so successful .... Well, otherwise I like the iPhone very much good and does what it should. It has very often and a lot of connection problems, but this can also be due to the telecom. I'd rather get the 6s needed today and be happy instead of throwing my money out the window and being annoyed.	0

I am a little surprised, because the seller has received good reviews and I therefore ordered. Maybe I was also sent a wrong device. Pity!	0
iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Andre K	1	Fast processor and what else?	2017-10-20	de	Actually madness for the device to spend so much money. The bad thing is the LG and Samsung already have borderless displays and I should pay even more for the botch. If I want rimless Apple, should I buy the apple X and pay double the sls at the competition? Fingerscanner simply missing, because you did not get the housed? Sorry apple gave my contract out directly sold. This is murks and next year, all Apple models are guaranteed to be borderless except for the Se.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Ben The Tideline	1	For the professional life now completely unfit	2016-12-06	de	I travel a lot for work and talk a lot. Since the "" Upgrade "" on iPhone 7, it is at some point always a fight between quickly reload and phone. Bluetooth handsfree would be a possibility, but not in the well-known headphone quality. With the headphones, the phone call is so pleasant that the called often does not even hear that I'm in the car. Thus, for professional frequent travelers - and not suitable Telefon.Update - after one year in use, the battery hardly an hour. No wonder, Apple simply turns off disabled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Even if you make it out. Ridiculous.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Anonymiker	4	Lots of light - a little shade	2015-12-30	de	As a longtime Apple user, I would like to break no lance for or against Apple products, but especially on the improvements or deteriorations - compared to my previous device the iPhone 5 - go in: The strongest contrast is first in the larger phone - and the larger screen. One of my big worries was that fact: would the cell phone not be too big for me? ... I've heard from some people traveling around that they wanted to have their old device back at once. For me, exactly the opposite effect occurred: I had already grown in size after 5 minutes, that I was seriously considering whether the iPhone 6S + would not have been even better. Only rarely do you get to a corner not as well off as in the past - but what you gain for additional vision makes up for the 10x. Here's a very big PLUS. The next big thing is the fingerprint scanner. Of course all those who have an iPhone 5S or newer already know that - but for me it was a big news. Unfortunately, it is not quite mature yet. I used to work classically with the message center. Say: the first push of a button showed me the time - with the second wipe I was in the message center. Today I can hardly avoid that I am automatically logged on ... and (and then you realize then that the phone has got bigger) to wipe from top to bottom, you have to stretch his hand already uncomfortable. In addition - and this is also a small disadvantage - I need now longer to get into the camera mode, because always only the registration takes place. Thus I miss the one or the other nice snapshot :-( But - and I find that considerable - the iPhone 6S keeps longer with the battery than my iPhone 5 although it has a larger display, many more sensors and also constantly scanning my fingerprint .Eas ugly I think the on / off button to the side to lay in. Sure - you get better off ... BUT: if you want to take a screenshot (and I do that more often) then you get very often in parallel to the volume buttons - and that prevents the screenshot.Last small defect - of which I do not know if it is only on my device or at all: the sockets for the charging cable and the headphones are a bit sharp Sensitive as far as my fingers are concerned - but I'm used to something else from Apple in this regard, and I suspect that it's because all the edges on the iPhone 6S are rounded - this keeps the fingers from touching If I find that this "" error "" only on my device is present, I will add this here.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	TaXi	1	Defective battery! Apple finally offers exchange program	2017-01-07	de	First: I am actually a peaceful-friendly Apple Iphone user since the Iphone 4. Only since the 6s started the trouble. Somehow there is now the worm in it and the whole Apple experience came to a halt, also thanks to lack of Inovation. Right annoying is the battery error: My 6s turns off in a light cold immediately (whether walking, running / jogging, photos at the customer to attempt). I asked the telephone support for clarification months ago and they have actually admitted that there are massive problems (allegedly because of incorrect programming) but my battery would be - according to remote maintenance - in order. Then I was in Centro Oberhausen over Christmas and I'm there in the Apple Store. Behold! There is now an exchange program (found on the apple page and support and then at the bottom "" 6s turns off "" Check here if your phone is affected - Yes of course it was das.Ich could leave the Iphone there and then pick up in 4 days ... erhh yes tips idea.Since I live not in the Centro Oberhausen I have called a Gravis Store in my city. Currently, so many phones are affected (so here can not be the case of individual cases!) that I have to wait three weeks for the new battery, because Apple does not exchange or send out new batteries - NO - first my phone has to be sent in and then there is the new battery - well, what am I doing with my customers in the meantime? Or no matter what, do private individuals who would like to have a cell phone in time? Why Apple offers nothing for (replacement of the cell phone - you should repair it and then resell or take back the scrap and give us a new one). I think it's not ok anyway a cell phone which 800, - EUR now costs to open and reinsert the battery in a service building. This has m.M.n. then nothing more to do with the quality directly from the factory and is still a real Entwertung.Also be careful at 6s - I would not buy it anymore. Make your own picture and google for the battery problem that is very common.	0

My family has been using Apple phones for a while, but not me. Nobody could really convince me so far to buy an Apple device. Although there are also regular updates for the devices but these only cause problems. Starting with shortened battery life up to suspended IOS. And I had to judge it again and again as an old Android root user. Have screwed around on these iphones often and I can only say one thing: Save the nice money. Apple should finally start to develop better devices for this price range. Highend devices with Android operating system allow more options, that goes with Apple only with the annoying Jailbreak variant. Apple devices are in my opinion for users who prefer a very simple operation or are simply overwhelmed with Android. Anyway, Apple has not convinced me so far. This has nothing to do with the price, because you get at Samsung and Co simply more.	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Susann Roßberg	2	No chance against Samsung!	2017-04-16	de	My personal opinion about the iPhone 7plus 128 GB results from the handling with the device. I was already disappointed in the unpacking, because the device, from the point of view, was clearly below my expectations. The device can not be used without SIM even! The next sobering point. A device for 900 ¬, which can not even activate via Wi-Fi and a SIM for the initial installation requires is already brazen.The reception was at the same location 2 bars (points) worse and instead of LTE, there was only 3G. Audio files from the PC could not be transferred to the iPhone because the phone is not recognized. A Syncronisation went only over iTunes Store at the PC. At the same time 3 albums have completely disappeared! The device has the very good and bright display and the decent sound via headphones, which unfortunately can only be connected via the cheap adapter. Simultaneous headphone operation and charging the battery does not work. The launcher can also be personalized by far not as in Android devices. The missing "" return "" button was the k.o. Argument, because you just push away apps but not really close. The device goes back. My first iPhone was sobering! Where does this hype come from?	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Sebastian R.	1	Poor performance and hazardous to health for a high price	2017-02-10	de	I use the iPhone 7 for nearly three months now and have a first opinion about the device formed. Unfortunately, I have to say that the disadvantages predominiegen.Mir is incomprehensible how to use the camera of the iPhone 7 even as a start as well or with those The competitions in the dark or at night have an extreme noise, which can not be mitigated by the very limited setting options. In addition, the extreme restrictions and restraints which one submits to the use of an Apple product, for someone who previously an Android device was used, a nuisance. Contacts from the phone book can only be sent to other users of Apple products. When talking on the phone heats up extremely over the entire side of the holding the smartphone, the use of the headset is highly recommended and saves Kopfschmerzen.Ich received the device as a business phone which is why I do not care about the extremely overpriced inappropriate price. No doubt there are also two positive points. The finish and feel is definitely unique in the market and great.2. Apple gives the user a sense of security for their own data and while using Apps.Ich would get me no more iPhone, because you have more disadvantages than advantages in comparison to the competition.	0

During the request for identification to the server, he does not recognize any more the serial number because there is an error every time, after screen sharing with most remote assistants at apple, full of problems, be sure that they pause when you put your password ... because he always finds ways to distract you to integrate on your device, if you bought your device on the internet, the risk is 80%, because they took your serial number, all applications are problematic, you will certainly have the same people without you noticing to help you when you are down. It's a scourge, I have two iMacs and iPhone, everything is contaminated with a single cloud cloud ID , so-called uper well protected, but not all purchases made on a private site are all gone.

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	1	Chris	2017-11-03	de	Unfortunately, little innovation. The fact that you can no longer paden the battery at the same time and listen to music with headphones is just as much a joke as the homebutton, which no longer recognizes moisture or light dirt on the finger and thus unlocks only after five failed Versucgen. So nothing for craftsmen or people who like to bathe. The third joke is the supposedly sapphire crystal, which of course is none. The iPhone has dropped me twice from low altitude and twice the display has jumped. Too bad.	0

Thus, of course, the warranty has already expired and it is therefore not new. In addition, was missing in the packaging, which was rewelded incidentally, the adapter from Lightning to Aux.

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	nexus-hh	1	They are crazy, the Californians ...	2016-09-25	de	The iPhone 7 has now been delivered directly from Apple, but goes back again. It's brave to bring such a smartphone on the market and then not even available, statement in the Apple Store Hamburg Jugfernstieg, "" Since you have just daily from 6 clock watch online, if you can reserve one, we know not, when or which ones come "". And after this statement, the disinterested hip staff was already gone again. The iPhone 7 sounds audible, not only when you hold your ear directly, but also from a few centimeters away. The display has a slight yellow cast for me, does not look brighter than the 6s. The smartphone will be warm, even when it is not busy, in a software update even hot. The missing headphone jack is annoying, as previously assumed, the sound with adapter slightly worse. The included headphones have always been out of the question, who gets those things properly in the ears, the sound and the quality are miserable anyway. The display edges are still incomprehensible too large, Apple is giving away a larger display area. Battery life is bad as usual. In addition, the phone rattles like crazy when you tap lightly on the back or it touches in the upper part, loose parts? In 2016, I find only HD resolution and no fast charging cable too brave. It is outrageous Apple to offer a smartphone that is not available for sale and that has so many (quality) problems. Quite apart from the completely overpriced price, I therefore advise: Stay away. In addition, the fingerprint sensor also works miserably.	0

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Mik217	2	From iPhone 6S to XR? D rather not!	2019-04-29	de	First of all to me iPhone 4, iPhone 6S- Usable features: One-hand mode by double tap, 3D touch, Touch ID, opening the camera via control center, power saving mode permanently on.- large hands- Most used apps: Snapchat, Whatsapp, Facebook , Instagram, various games, news appsPlus: ++ Design, case size, weight +++ operation + touch ID criticism at 6s: --- very low battery life (at least 2x load a day) (now 77% battery power, but power-saving mode always on + Stromfresser like Bluetooth and Wlan switched off on the way) - screen size too small- speed, resolution, camera not up-to-date (but personally I do not find sooo annoying) - soon no more updatesThese annoying problems have moved me to pick up a new model for some years now One day I had the iPhone XR in use and can say the following things (not purchased on Amazon) ++ Battery life top (very much use: games, Bluetooth and WLAN perma nent on, rumprobieren, etc.) and had 10h use still 40% + speed: the apps open much faster, and the display recognizes the inputs much faster. + Of course, the camera is better than my old 6s + color and optics (Back side): the matt aluminum frame and the darker black look very good. + I did not miss the 3D touch as the haptic touch covers 90% of the functions. But now on the negative aspects: first, the ones that bother me less: - Design (front): The Notch I personally do not like, if I hold the XR transversely to watch videos. The thick edge makes the iPhone appear a bit cheap in my opinion - I personally like the fingerprint sensor better than Face-ID, since you always have to raise the phone to unlock.- The cases for the XR on Amazon are so thick that of there can be no question of transparency. Very thick, milky and make the iPhone additionally unhandlicher.Nun to the annoying stuff in my view- As I have already mentioned very large hands, but I consider the XR including sleeve with one hand to use as catastrophic. It's heavy (weight), with the thumb you can never reach the top edge (open control center) and activate the one-hand mode (with a wiper down) does not always work or quit alone before you could perform an action (especially in Snapchat conspicuous) - I have a constant feeling it falls out of my hand.- The low resolution compared to the Xs or X (pretty much the same price) does not justify the high price. Conclusion: After a day, the XR migrated without signs of wear and polished back, because immediately shell and protective film were attached. Even if the display is nice and big, the camera / speaker notch reduces the feeling. The most important thing with my smartphone is a simple and fast operation with mostly one hand. That was impossible with the XR. For such a price, I expect more. In some places you can still notice that the software has not quite adapted to the notch. Furthermore, I personally miss the home button, due to the one-hand mode. And with hindsight I could have dealt with Assistive Touch. And maybe that's just my impression, but somehow the display seemed cheap. I like to use my iPhone 6S and am a fan of the operating system. I now have some concerns about an X model (due to much better battery life, updates and better resolution). Since the X is smaller than the XR, I think the handling will also be easier. Unfortunately, the XR failed with me.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Vivi	2	Worst interaction with IOS	2017-09-06	de	After almost a year now, I can finally explain myself able to write a reasonable review of the iPhone 7. It will certainly give some text. First: After my initial dislike of Apple years ago, I realized at some point that the products essential cleaner and problem-free than any other device on the market. For years I was very satisfied with my Apple devices. As far as the iPhone is concerned, I've never been so disappointed with an iPhone. I have had so many IPhones among all IOS versions but the iPhone 7 is a real disaster. Not because of some nonsense because of no jack connection, etc. --- People will move with the times and if you do not want it then just do not buy it. One also moves into an expensive apartment that you do not like and then just moans around. --- The problem is not even the hardware but definitely the software. From Apple, I've always been used to holding a product in my hands, which is fully mature. Meanwhile, this is far from the case. I own the iPhone 7 in rose gold with 128GB of memory, which is already an exchange product from Apple - but unfortunately also has the same Fehler.Zu beginning: I never had problems with Finding of mobile network etc. The sound is very nice, the display of the display is clean and pleasant, and the camera works perfectly - all things I can expect for as much money as I think. Now to the mistakes that Over time, I'm getting more and more annoyed and force myself to hard-reset the iphon almost every day. The IPhone had problems with Bluetooth from the start. Sometimes it connects, sometimes not (with different devices mind you). If you're lucky, there is a perfect connection, if not you have crashes every second and may be at the car radio, for example. Look forward to music that sounds only every second second. Both my first (purchased from release), as well as the exchange device makes (t) en this problem. Then: Unexpected snagging so that no action is possible for a minute. Neither display nor buttons react then. Also: Constantly crashing the most diverse apps. Some do not even start anymore. The battery runs incredibly fast even though it is not old and should actually last longer than before (I'm not a cell phone user and have a normal daily use - sometimes a WhatsApp message, sometimes Googling, sometimes on the Watch calendars or weather and occasionally write notes - depending on the day sometimes more and less use but not exaggerated) - Well the battery sometimes does not even hold until the evening and although I volllade.Updates lately also made without as of I'm set to hang on the charger?! Insufficient accuracy and function of the display ... and since the last IOS update constantly problems with the synchronization of emails (and as I said, it is far from my first iPhone, the usual setup errors or connection errors I exclude confidently) I have to get rid of how frustrating that is. I'm glad when I get my iphone 7 finally going on. Wait for the keynote from Apple to the iPhone 8. If I should like it and the budget does not blow up (which I assume, however) I will upgrade. If not, I'll downgrade and get a 6s, 6s or 5s again, which would be much better. Too bad I never thought I'd ever be able to give an Apple product only 2 stars. But there I have to stay objective, that is simply an impertinence I was never used to from Apple. I hope there will be a lot of improvement with the next models.	0

A German charger was separate. The device had a Spanish default and otherwise a rather "" wild "" basic configuration. A bill with VAT ID card was also not there, so that I can now draw no input tax, which makes the device by a whopping 19% more expensive. Dear Amazon, I trust as a customer actually that you protect me from such unpleasant surprises and list only sellers who either supply the goods, which I can expect or who clearly point out deviations in their description. We only kept the device because we needed immediate replacement because of theft, otherwise we would have sent it back. After all, the delivery took place within 24 hours.	0

It's not really the problem it's just that if c is not written we do not know and it is disappointing if one day we come to resell it will be complicated without the box	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	H. Michael	2	Ingenious mobile phone minus sound quality minus radiation minus price	2017-01-11	de	Well, I'm doing it very briefly. I'm in principle very convinced by Apple and I'm not deterred by the lack of headphone jack. It would in principle be a great smartphone + chic design + battery is ok (could be bigger but is enough) + great performance + iCloud and iTunes Convenience + feel engine and 3D touch complete the whole very good as far as 5 stars from me Now come the problems that raises the iPhone with which I honestly did not expect.- 1 star due to the price. I knew that and I expected that, but the purchase still hurts. Unfortunately, my old iPhone was broken unexpectedly, so I needed a new one and thought then I want a "" current "" device. If you then informed and the high-end smartphones of the competition looks like with similar (some better) features for half of the price offered you have to swallow-1 star because of the problematic sound quality ... The adapter ensures losses in the Sound quality and Bluetooth is unfortunately not implemented as you would expect, especially from Apple. Bluetooth is fine with the Bose system. Before that it did not matter because Aux was always available. Now you need a good wireless connection. Unfortunately, e.g. not a decent Bluetooth Aux find adapter, since Apple does not support the apTX standard (Bluetooth in CD quality!) - 1 star deduction because of the high radiation value, I have read randomly online. The radiation value is in the cell phone is well above the values ​​of the competition, Partial Factor 4! Apple himself says you should not hold the device to the head ... More you have to say at this point I think I do not think I'll sell it and get me a 6S or something. Maybe I also dare to jump to Android. Mainly because of the audio quality :(	0

However for the price I would have liked a higher quality processing. Glued parts of the case were not really glued fit. The longevity of the case leaves a lot to be desired. For me breaks after the short use since the plastic of the holder for the smartphone. The iPhone has never fallen down. The phone is generally in my hand, on the desk or in my purse.

iPhone XS	256GB	Gray	Leonardo	2	Iphone Xs with aesthetic defect	2019-05-03	it	I state that Amazon is and will remain synonymous with guarantee for me even after this experience. Unfortunately I find myself making this negative review for the following reasons: I purchased an iphone Xs 256 GB gray sidereal about 10 days ago. The smartphone will arrive on the day and without even turning it on, I apply a previously purchased protection film. I configure the phone restoring my backup and migrating all the main applications, losing half a day. The day after the purchase, handling the phone, I notice a kind of bulge / draft in the upper right part of the iphone. I call support, explaining what I found and promptly sent me a new phone (I love Amazon for this). I put the phone back in its packaging and after a few days of waiting I get the new phone. Same scheme: as soon as I open I apply a New film ( repurchased) to the new smartphone. I put more than half a day to reconfigure everything and reset the first smartphone to make the return. After doing everything, convinced to be okay, I look at the phone and I realize that the new one has the same defect (see photo). from a smartphone costing more than 1200 euros you expect perfection, and instead ... I decided to keep it anyway, because I can't lose other days between backup / restore and mail waiting for the return. However I feel very dissatisfied and above all disappointed for Amazon and Apple (I wonder where is the quality control?) I take this opportunity to ask a question to those who maybe know more than me: but can such a defect affect the physical characteristics? (impact resistance).	0

Apple did not know what to offer except to send the phone for repair (75km from home, so 150 round trip), so I sent it back to Amazon. Now I'm waiting for the refund from Amazon, which takes 10 days worked (so for them, 15 days) from the date of receipt of the package. For 499 euros, it's a somewhat disappointing experience, even painful, I do not know if there was a better way to find a new phone, now I'm without phone> _ <. The few 10 days during which j I was able to enjoy the phone, it seemed very well designed, perfect ergonomics, impression of power very correct for my use, its only defect compared to current phones is in my opinion at the level of sound (mono, a little too much in the treble, not very nice to listen to music or watch a movie). I only made a few pictures, but they looked good, clearly above the old iPhone. To put in perspective for the most advanced users because I am not a "" power user "" (no games, no gourmet apps, no 4K video), I did not notice any particular weakness. it is a phone that is not at the forefront of technology, but is very nice to use for those who do not want to complicate life, like a Mercedes automatic that would have 100 or 200,000 km. The price (nine) is in my opinion too high for the technology.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Peter Assfalg	1	No help, just rip off	2019-06-13	de	Unfortunately, I have had very disappointing and bad experiences: After a few years and two android phones, I decided again for an Apple iPhone and bought me in September 2018, a new iPhone 8 for around 650 ¬. I was completely satisfied and fell in love again with the surface, the handling, the operation and the shape. I could not have imagined a better phone ... Until in May 2019 suddenly my outdoor camera stopped responding, my flashlight stopped working and the mobile phone often reported a simcard error. Over a three-quarters of a year, I was very careful and handled the phone carefully. I never fell down and was protected all the time with a solid case and a protective glass. So I thought: A clear guarantee. After a short phone call with the AppleSupport the phone was picked up for repair at my home and was already in the repair center at Apple 2 days after the phone call. In the phone call, I was told that Apple repaired any damage or repaired no damage at all. After a few days, I got feedback from Apple: On my phone, another defect was found, which does not include the warranty and thus expire. There were pictures of the corresponding "defect" attached. These were my loudspeakers, in which was dirt, lint, etc. of my trouser pocket. I already knew that. Anyway, Apple declared this as a defect and demanded for the total repair of my eight month old iPhone a contribution of 317,02 € + tax (!!!!). I feel pulled over the table and unrestrained abgezockt.Warum I pay 650 ¬ for a telephone, which has eight months after technical failures, then I'll even crappy for my warranty and on top of that also roughly ¬ 350 as repair costs for damage that is not in my responsibility is to pay? Why should one still buy Apple products there? For 350 ¬ there are now android phones that have at least as good a performance as the iPhone 8. What I find almost saddest: not a coworker has my actually problem, the defective camera or the flashlight ever accepted. Neither at the 'repair' nor on the phone. It was always about the speaker "defect" and about the fact that I alone have to pay for the repair. I have the cell phone returned unrepaired and have visited a local mobile workshop. I have during the Apple "repair" almost 14 days to give up my mobile phone. An indictment of a company like Apple. Here, as a customer as I have now found, just ripped off. To offer the customer help stands at Apple probably now at the bottom. That would never have been in the sense of the inventor. I am very disappointed.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Berki	3	Many things are out of date	2019-03-24	de	After some android I wanted to switch to an iPhone again. I deliberately chose the iPhone 8 because I wanted the home button again and a fingerprint sensor instead of Face ID. For optics and processing, you really can not say much, Apple stop and definitely beyond any doubt. What I noticed only in the setup and the test in the first few minutes that much of the IPhone is just not up to date anymore. The display is a really blurry and lifeless, if you before Samsung, Huawei etc. has used. Even the display edges are simply unacceptable for a late 2017 outgoing smartphone. In addition, I noticed that the wireless reception is very weak. With my Galaxy S9 I have some areas of the apartment still had two lines reception, whereas the IPhone has no reception at all and the WLAN does not even find. By contrast, the video camera is very good again. I can not say much about the battery, since I only had it in operation for about 30 minutes and then reset it again. On the whole, unfortunately not what I expected and therefore must return.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	rumpelstielchen	3	My first I Phone ... maybe the last one ...	2018-02-03	de	To prehistory: I have previously used a Microsoft Lumia 950 Dual Sim phone. That was just convenient because I only had to lug around a cell phone with me and was separated professionally and privately just clean. In addition, the compatibility with the company software was given, which then animated me to buy Lumia. Meanwhile, my company switched to I Phones. Since there are no Apple Dual SIM variants (why probably only Apple) and an Android phone for me was out of the question (very bad experience from the past), so I decided to buy the I Phone 8.The first surprises I experienced while transferring the data from the old phone to the I Phone. Without I Tunes or I Cloud nothing works ... Whats App Backups from Windows transferred ... Pustekuchen. That was a lot easier with Windows ... The operating system seems a lot more complicated than WIN10 mobile. Example: I tried to write a mail and in parallel to look in another mail what ... does not work ... or I'm too stupid for who knows ... But there are of course also positive to report: The feel, the speed, the camera and the stability of the operating system as well as the hardware processing are really great. But you may also ask for a price of over 700, - €. Overall, I understand the hype about Apple products but not quite. For my part, I feel already bothered by the compulsive defaults that Apple partially makes (software use, memory upgrades, battery, etc ...). Whether I will stay with Apple will show the time. Too bad that it has not understood the leadership of Microsoft, to gain a foothold in the mobile phone market ... From the handling was my WIN10 mobile by far the most ...	0

iPhone XR	64GB	White	PEPPE BIT	5	what to say: ALWAYS APPLE ALL LIFE	2019-02-24	it	Maybe because I have been buying APPLE for 18 years, it will be that I loved STEVE JOBS since it only sold products that nobody bought, but this XR was a surprise. . he had asked me why all the classmates had that brand that made FICO. Then, every night, he always asked me for my APPLE 8 PLUS and left the new one on the LUNCH table. AT THE END he asked me to change it with the XR. LESS EVIL THAT WAS AMAZON PRIME !! SAID DONE: returned the product and purchased the XR. Revolutionary product compared to my 8, total screen, brightness and colors unattainable for my DEVICE. It reads everything like a KINDLE for clarity of characters and contours of letters and images. Different gestures in the access phase to the screens but, as always with APPLE, immediate and intuitive. MACHINE photos at the level of my 8 even if in my humble opinion still my terminal if the PLAY with the XR in terms of depth of field and brightness of the lens. The last advantage of the XR is that it is very long but narrower than my 8. So WE READ GOOD chat and FB and ONLINE NEWSPAPERS without having to keep scrolling down the page given the screen size in length. BUY NOW WITHOUT DOUBT	0

And I love big phones! What would you recommend? Which of the 3's? Please only give some tips that have the respective IPhones :) that would help me the most !! I would buy the iPhone and not here in Germany, but in Switzerland:) To a lot of cheaper, of course, connects one then with a holiday :) or rather the other way round: Please ask for tips.

Thus, it was not a new device as stated but probably only to an already returned and re-sold iPhone. Otherwise, the iPhone worked quite well. By iOS11 could only see that the battery was already at 90% wear. IPhone went back for the simple reason that it was not new.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Dirk G.	3	With one hand, unfortunately, no longer in the upright format to use	2018-11-01	de	The iPhone 10 is unfortunately bad in one hand and the control panels are no longer reachable with the thumb. The now "virtual" homebutton is located at the bottom of the iPhone. In order to achieve this, the iPhone has to be gripped at the bottom, which then, due to the extended design, unfortunately leads to the one tilting the iPhone backwards out of his hand. The control center is now stored at the top right of the display, so far away from the homebutton. Both functions can only be reached via constant embrace. This is complicated and annoying. If the iPhone is turned from high to across, the screen rotates as usual. Unfortunately, it is now the case that due to the camera list in the upper part of the display, it looks like the display is defective in this area. Not nice either. With shocked I have now heard that the new iPhone 10 r is even longer, so the upright operation with one hand even less is possible. Face ID is stupid in the car: Previously could simply be pressed the homebutton to unlock the iPhone now must While driving, the iPhone will be properly aligned for faceid to work. This is actually impossible if the phone is in a rigid mobile phone car holder ... Otherwise, it should be mentioned here, the display, the camera, the photo software and the performance is breathtakingly good.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	Loris	1	Worst iPhone I've ever owned	2016-02-14	de	I had an iPhone 4, 2x 4s and a 5s and I have a MacBook Pro and Apple TV is so familiar with Apple products and actually appreciate the quality and ease of use of the products. The 6s is the first iPhone, which I am very disappointed. For one, it does not bring any meaningful novelties and bores through it. It's the first iPhone that I do not think wow cool part. That alone would be a pity, of course, but not a real problem. What on the other hand is a problem for me is that after just 4 months makes problems that I know otherwise only from hearsay other smartphones. The battery of the 6s discharges faster than any other iPhone. In one day, the battery has 40% and it just goes out and requires power. On another day, it consumes between 60-80% charge within 6 hours without a charger. Even my 4 year old 4s lasts much longer. As if that was not enough, the 6s has so many software problems, like no other of my iPhones before that. Even a 1/8 Huawei Y550 works better, probably because Steve Jobs is no longer living. The first iPhone after his death, he had probably still been involved or Apple still had ideas of him in the bag, but they seem to be used up. In the meantime, I have the feeling that you only pay for the name at Apple and not the wonderful uniqueness and quality that an iPhone once had. Of course NOT a buy recommendation!	0

It's shameful, then we will continue with iOS 10 and all its slew of bugs, fortunately the iPhone 7 is not too touched but there are still ... Fortunately, it films very well and the autonomy is strongly on the rise, the 3D Touch and the Home button are super practical and apart from the screen it is really very good. I put only 3 stars because the shot of the screen with 2 scratches only 1 month after the purchase makes me angry, it is just inadmissible to pay a phone as expensive for a glass of such low quality!	0

Well, we all have enough free time for it? Take care that the battery NEVER gets really empty. Why? Yes that happened to me twice and 3 of my friends too. If you do not power the smartphone within the next 30min it is DEEP DOWNLOAD, well with everyone it is different, my colleague had it on stream 14h so it showed signs of life again has at the other about 20h and with me even over 35h. now 35h without a cell phone where everything is stored inside and you can reach without replacement cell phone anyone is shit! FOR A SMARTPHONE THAT HIGH CALIBERS SHOULD HAVE MAXIMUM 1-2 HOURS OF DURATION AND NOT DAMAGED 2 DAYS. The same happened to me Iphone 6 and I have directly bought an IPHONE 7 and lo and behold, the same problem. As if that were not enough, they arrive with their stupid safety. One can use his Apple ID nirgens because the whole time want to somehow code what was sent on the defect device. You will not get an appointment online without a ID in this store. My tip: do you buy this, never let the battery go empty, and buy iphone 6, because there is not a big unteschied. I used both and wasted money unnecessarily.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Scotty	1	Why Apple?	2018-05-01	uk	The IPhone was doing well up untill the 6S and was beating Samsung but not any more...Apple are verry good business people and could stick there name on anything and people would still buy it like the Air Pods! See just buy removing the headphone Jack they want you to spend more of your money.The question you are wondering ""Is this phone really worth £1000?"" NO IT ISN'T!Here are the reasons why-1) It says it has the best display on a phone yet it isn't as good as Samsung displays from the S7 onwards. Even worse why did they cut some of the screen out for the notch when they should of just placed it above in all black so you atleast get the whole screen when you are watching videos.2/3) Crap Battery life compared to phones half the price of this! Also your gonna constanly need a power bank but that means you can't use headphone when charging so you will have to use bluetooth earphones that won't last as long as normal earphones.4) The dual Camera looks like a rubbish version of Wall-E5) It will slow down next year with an even worse battery meaning you will have to buy another £1000 Phone.If you have sense just don't buy it!	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Client d'Amazon	2	A little disappointed	2018-11-10	fr	I received the iPhone X but unfortunately I realized that the phone is not new: it is a phone surely reconditioned or used, but it was not specified on the ad, it was written "NINE" and not "AS NEW" (suddenly even if I recognize that the external state of the phone is impeccable it still impossible to determine the wear of the phone, its components ...). accessories delivered with are not official (not the Apple brand), besides the headphones do not work.I confess to be disappointed ... Result for a phone to almost 1100 euros I tell myself that the quality / price ratio n is not terrible.	0
iPhone XS Max	256GB	Space Gray	Malabulaba	1	Overvalued product with many disadvantages!	2019-01-26	de	For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Use only if the phone with the display is up on the table Warranty / Guarantee: The iPhone XS is indeed high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Apple gives on its products generally only 12 months Manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the price policy actually almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone from the top My assessment of a star refers exclusively to the criticism mentioned above.One note: I am willing to comment on factual comments, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and with criticism can not handle! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.	0
iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	mario	3	matter of taste	2017-11-28	de	Three starsWhy? Technique, equipment and the certain step to be ahead of the others earn 5 points. I have been an iPhone user for several years now and I am thrilled with that. However, I like to leave the exact test reports to people who seem to have their own test lab at home. For the price ...... Wienn I buy at launch the top mobile phone of the competition and to a top memory card with 256 GB, then I am on an equal footing financially. If I sell a cell phone of the competition after two years, then maybe I get 200 euros. I sell an iPhone after two years, then I get half and more. Now that ..... and that's my own tasteThe missing home button and the display are for me an absolute nogo.Beim display I do not mean the technology , Rather, I mean the look. The display looks like a screen protector. On the left and right higher than in the middle, I personally do not like that at all. That's why I decided against the x and the 8plus.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	M.K.	2	not the best phone I've ever had	2017-09-30	de	After years of using Samsung, I took the step in the direction of Apple and regret it in several points. Very poor reception no matter wlan, mobile data or normal Telefonienetz.Ich I switched from a Samsung S5 on the Iphone 7 and had directly bad reception. It did not get any better after replacing the sim card. With further searches on the Internet turned out that many people have the problem. What brings me a cell phone where the basic functions do not work? Optical and the operation really top but I live half in the country half in the city and have problems the network problems ( which I did not have before with the S5) Especially with a over 600 ¬ Handy the basic characteristics should work but unfortunately you do not.

iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	sm	1	Beware of 'UK Supplies'	2017-03-07	uk	New phone ordered Friday, arrived Tuesday, and appears to be genuine and new, happy with all that. However after opening I noticed a sheet in the package stating that the phone will work with any network but once a SIM card is inserted the phone is then forever locked to that network, going on to say that if you are not happy with that then send back for full refund. That information should be in the description before purchase not a surprise on opening. And in any case I had already opened the phone. That is not what is generally understood by 'SIM free' and the answers to the questions that have been asked do not mention this locking so definitely deliberately holding back information. Nul points from me.	0

But honestly ..... I miss Touch ID. Face ID works fine, but I personally liked Touch ID. With Face ID the Lockscreen still has to be searched up to land on the homescreen. One should not be too far away from the camera so that it is unlocked at all. These 2 points meanwhile go to the biscuit and lead to a point deduction in the review.

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	1	Vendor flop, Amazon top	2018-07-19	de	I ordered the iPhone 7 last November and was very satisfied at first, until I took the first pictures. I noticed that the camera often could not fix properly and the image quality was pretty much for the A ****. It was very strange to me, just because Apple is known to have a good image quality. Nevertheless, I was able to live with it. Exactly 6 months later, however, my reservations were confirmed, the iPhone was out, despite loading it could not be switched on anymore and I must add that I treated the mobile phone like in cotton wool (was not exactly that either not much I paid for it). It never fell off, did not get wet and I tried to load it as seldom as possible. I immediately contacted the vendor and unfortunately I just got a standard message in reply, which really disappointed me. Luckily I did not throw in the towel right away and turned to amazon directly. I have to say, Amazon sent me a return slip immediately after my message (without any shipping costs), with the statement I get the full money back , Except for a longer wait and a short response from my side, everything ran smoothly afterwards and I got my money back. Thanks again to the customer service of Amazon, you can really rely on it! The direct provider, however, is more likely to be one Flop .. the Apple devices do not seem to be 100% original and not high quality either.	0

iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	▂ ▃ ▅ ▆ L U K E ▆ ▅ ▃ ▂	1	Excessively overrated - Expensive is not perfect	2019-05-16	de	■ Purchased version:  iPhone XS Max • 256 GB ~ Space Gray ■ Hello everybody, I also want to briefly and briefly because much has already been written in advance, say a lot to what has annoyed me as an Apple Fan Boy animal. I did not buy it because of the price here on Amazon. I was very pleased with the new iPhone XS MAX. Purchased, and intensively tested here is my result in a compressed version. I was stressed above all because of the camera and battery! Much of the negative experiences I can underline here. My first impression: looks like a grown iPhone X out. And for the many money, of course, very chic and beautiful. Very noble, very good workmanship! • UNBOXING: Despite high-end price of proud 1600 € lacks u.a. a part of the iPhone X was still on board - also: no quick charger and no Qi charging pad. Impudence! So Apple has abruptly abolished wired jack headphones completely. If you want to have the adapter, you can pay a hefty 10 euros when you buy it directly from Apple.Otherwise, there is the usual stuff: a Lightning cable and a power adapter and ear pods with a Lightning connector. • PERFORMANCE: Apple's highly acclaimed performance did not really blow me away. Overall: way too slow, maybe a bit faster than my iPhone X (40% faster) .Apps also do not open faster. There is no leap forward. As far as surfing is concerned, I'll save it, it'll be silly with Safari. People who can see a little bit worse could get in trouble with it. What I found very funny though, was that despite the huge display many apps that did not exploit. Of all this, I especially liked the huge OLED display. Really first cream.BUY: Keep still in mind that this device costs 1600 €. • OPERATION: The operation altogether was not a problem for me personally. For people with small hands and newbies here are some problems with the operation before programmed. The screen diagonal could be too good for some: With the one-handed operation, as already written, not all areas of the display can easily be reached. • CAMERA: As a hobby photographer, I love to capture pictures in nature and sometimes at night Unfortunately, here some people are not 100% happy, they are silky, they take it that way! Honestly not better than my iPhone X..Why? The pictures are very natural! No question, BUT: compared to the high-end product from a well-known manufacturer, what my colleague, his pictures are much better. Because just in the low-light more light on his sensor zulässt.Und the automatic often disappears and creates The VIDEO camera! Very nice and supple shots. One should still keep in mind that this smartphone costs 1600 €. • FRONT CAMERA: The front camera can Why: Even here are selfies of the competition compared to a top model from Appleum far better, both at night and during the day. • AKK UDisplayhelligkeit00 clock out of the house, on the go music heard- from 8 - 17 clock: 5 x approx. 5 min. Videotelephony - 5 videos of 30 min each viewed - almost 1 hr on YouTube - 4 games gambled - each about 10 phone calls from average 10 min carried out - WhatsApp = At ​​the end of the day at 20 o'clock I still had 18%. The competition is a little better and more economical: Here the competition had a battery value of 31% at the end of the day • SPEAKER: Are super, mega. Rich sound much better than my iPhone X. To be honest, I was very surprised. Also with the bass I was very surprised. POSITIVE: + Display + Speaker + (VIDEO) Camera + Top ProcessingNEWRAL- Disappointing delivery- Price = Sheikh class- no real performance boost- No jack adapter, - no faster charger- Some apps do not use the large display - Disappointing Battery Disappointing development • FAZI TFo 1600 € you should give at least for its loyal Apple customers more in the scope of delivery. But Apple thinks of course in this point what: Who Apple wants to pay Apple and accessories for the small money as well I also hoped that this iTunes will finally get away and come in a different way (more innovative) used. Nothing. It remains the constant connection on iTunes.For the money, the competition is much better in my eyes. Since Steve died, one of his very good iPhones died with him. For me it was .... Thank you for reading my review! Hope it was a help in the purchase decision! If so, I would be very happy about a helpful click.	0

iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Dirk u. Antje	3	Now IOS? From Symbian to Android to iOS	2016-05-28	de	I'm changing from Symbian to Android now iPhone.Also the iPhone never crashes completely. If, then it is more of a program that hangs. But I miss the real fm radio. That's not the case with Apple. The support for memory cards and stick are not really no not here. No automatic redial when busy and no additional apps no speed dial. At Symbian gabs already sprachwahl and read from messages offline !!!!. That does not exist anymore. The compatibility with other Android devices is still not available via Bluetooth. With apps, data can be exchanged via its own hotspot. Videos can generally not be uploaded to the iPhone without the help of a PC, unless you take them In the Appstore, the free apps are very limited or provided with a lot of advertising, these are sometimes very intrusive.For Android, there are in my opinion a lot more free useful apps that makes life easier. But who wants to have a secure device is well served with any iPhone. However, one is definitely a bit more restricted with its traffic.	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Keine gekaufte Meinung.	1	What a disappointment	2018-12-20	de	After the drama with the iPhone X and their display problem, I wanted to give the newer version again a chance. To put it briefly, better take an older model which also works. Apps are mostly not optimized for the screen. iPhone crashes again and again. In the middle of phoning for example. Face ID did not work after the 2nd week, not a new configuration was not possible, more possible because the iPhone did not even recognize the face. Furthermore, the keyboard was displayed in the home screen although no input was required. Calls were superimposed on the home screen. Taking off was not possible. In these cases, only a deliberate restart of the iPhone helped. In this price category just a no-go. And I know iPhones since the 2nd generation (pictures will follow)	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	Alejandro	4	Is it worth buying it?	2018-10-20	it	* UPDATED * I purchased this new iPhone on the Apple Store online, just to try it out a little, having already an iPhone X; personally, I don't think it's worth buying, if you already have an iPhone X. This is the much-anticipated version "" S "" of the iPhone X. Let's try to understand what changes compared to the previous version and whether it's worth buying or not . Let's start by saying that there are NO big changes compared to the previous device. No news is resounding this year. The S version, as is well known, only goes to improve some aspects. Moreover, unusually, the most expensive and large "" Xs Max "" version has nothing different than the iPhone Xs, except for its size. We do not find more powerful processors or improved cameras. It's just a bigger iPhone Xs with more battery (and power consumption). I will continue to update this review as I use it. DESIGN: The iPhone Xs does not bring significant changes in design, except in the lower part where the symmetry of the holes, having added an additional antenna, to allow an enhanced reception, also given the novelty of the Dual Sim, which will be discussed later. The rear camera has been moved slightly a few millimeters higher, so the covers of the iPhone X will NOT be fully compatible with the new device. This year we also have the Gold variant. The design remains essentially unchanged, this device achieves an IP68 waterproof rating (6 indicates the maximum degree of dust resistance and 8 indicates a degree of impermeability and resistance , in case of contact with liquids, but especially with fresh water, for 30 minutes and a maximum of 2 meters deep). The guarantee of NO manufacturer, recognizes the damage caused by liquids, so it is better to refer to these specifications, considering ONLY soft water, being the liquid that causes less damage. The resistance to water and dust decreases with 'usury.PROCESSOR: The new iPhone Xs features the brand new Bionic A12 processor (retains the same marketing name as the previous A11 Bionic), but is the first smartphone processor to be built at 7 nanometers. It is equipped with 4GB of RAM, compared to the 3GB of the iPhone X, it is always equipped with 6 cores (2 high-performance and 4 high-efficiency), it has a second-generation neural engine (8-core) capable of performing 5000 billions of transactions in a second (against the 600 billion of the A11). The GPU is designed by Apple and has 4 cores against the 3 of the X. The 2 high-efficiency cores are dedicated to everyday operations, such as social media, apps, games. The 4 high-efficiency devices, on the other hand, are designed to save battery power when performing simpler operations such as chats and messages. However, when all the processor power is needed, iOS dynamically calibrates all six cores to deliver incredible performance (same as iPhone X). Thus, while performing heavy apps, such as augmented reality games or video editing, performance will be greatly improved. I do not find significant changes during everyday use compared to X. Probably, it also depends on the new operating system (iOS 12) not yet fully optimized on this new device. Both are very fast in all operations: multitasking, photos and videos, opening the app and, of course, in games .. BATTERY: Rightly, one wonders given the performance, the battery capacity. iPhone Xs is equipped with a 2658mAh battery (against the 2716mAh of iPhone X); iPhone Xs Max, on the other hand, has the largest battery an iPhone has ever had, that is 3174mAh (against the 2691mAh of the iPhone 8 Plus). iPhone Xs has less battery than iPhone X? Yes. Does it last less? At the moment, I have to say that the duration is a little lower than X, but I also think this depends on the software. FACE ID AND CAMERA: As I wrote above, the cameras are the same as the iPhone X, always with wide angle and telephoto lens with aperture focal length respectively of 1/1.8 and 2.4 / 2.4. Despite this, Apple has added some features on the new Xs / Xs Max, in my opinion, for pure marketing. In fact, both these models (but also the new Xr, with single camera, released at the end of October) are able to adjust the depth of field of a photo both before shooting and in post-production and have an advanced bokeh effect . These effects are also possible on the iPhone X via the Focos app, since the cameras are identical. Change the quality of the photos in low light for the better, since the sensor of the camera has larger pixels and, we also have the smartHDR that goes to perform more shots of the same subject, combining the best parts of each shot as a result (light, movement reduction, colors); according to Apple, this, the depth of field and the boken effect are possible thanks to the new processor able to perform more operations. Nothing that the processor of the iPhone X is not able to do, but anyway .. Even the sensors of the Face ID are identical to those of the previous model, but Apple reports an improvement in the algorithm of the Secure Enclave (separate processor to encrypt biometric passwords) which guarantees a faster unlocking, despite not being a second generation Face ID. Honestly, the speed seems to me to be the same as the iPhone X, which thanks to iOS 12 is even faster and more precise in unlocking. I am absolutely satisfied in this sense.DUAL SIM: We pay attention to this very important detail. The 3 new iPhones will NOT have Dual Sim functionality in Italy. This is because it is not possible to insert 2 physical Nano Sims, since the cart can contain only one physics, unlike the Chinese version that will have two. How does this system work? A sim will be physical, the second sim, instead, will be based on the "" Dual Sim Dual Standby "" technology that allows you to simulate the second sim in a virtual way. This is the future, as this system will make it very easy to change the telephone or operator offer. Unfortunately, at the moment, no operator in Italy allows this function. Probably Vodafone will be the first to catch up with this technology, but not for now (also because this feature requires iOS 12.1, for the moment in beta testing). CURRENTLY PRESENT FAULTS: If you have heard of the ChargeGate, know that it has been resolved with iOS 12.0.1 (did not allow reloading if the screen was off). According to some users, there is still a Beauty Gate that applies a sort of "" beauty filter "" automatically to selfies; in this way, the details of the face will be minimally captured, making the face look like that of a barbie. It seems to have been a bug that has just been solved with iOS 12.1. Some users also complain about an Antenna Gate, especially on the Xs Max, with poor reception in 4G / LTE and in WiFi. The WiFi part was resolved with 12.0.1, while the part concerning the antenna was solved with iOS 12.1. Obviously, in the event that this last problem occurs, Apple will replace the device, free of charge. I hope I helped you with the decision or clarified your ideas. If you have any other questions, please write me in the comments! :)	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	C. Lampe	1	Face recognition is an impertinence	2018-09-06	de	First off: Of course, the iPhone X is as good as all the iPhone's before him plus various improvements. The missing button is sometimes really missing, but one has got used to the operation by means of finger gestures quite quickly. Why then 1 star? Because the face (not) recognition drives you to madness. It is already stupid enough that you can not unlock the phone - like the one with finger-touch - directly at the elevation. But that would be bearable, if the facial recognition would work at least at the frontal superiority to 95% plus x. In fact, the rate is below 50%, the immediate detection (as in advertising) even at most 20%. If one can believe the traditions, Steve Jobs would have run in the face of such a worsened product probably in the headquater Amok, so it must be enough that he probably turns permanently in the grave. In any case, I have never owned an Apple product that I had to annoy every hour - to the iPhone X. Apple: Put, 6.	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Michael Merfels	1	IPhone, American scrap	2017-06-21	de	Never again iPhone junk. I ordered an iPhone 7 Plus with 128gb, the phone arrived pretty quickly, but sent in a joke package from Amazon itself, as one would expect from a 900 ¬ article, cheap and in no way appropriate , I opened the packaging and had to notice that on the phone the minus button was pressed to adjust the volume and could not be pulled out. And with a brand new phone for 900 ¬, no idea how something with Apple comes through the final inspection. I sent it back immediately and I'm curious how it works with the refund. But the very best is coming first. I thought that somehow it could happen and ordered the same phone again. After a week, the article was delivered, however, since I was not at home, to the neighbors. When I picked up the package, also in the same lousy, cheap Amazon packaging in the evening, I immediately noticed that the box was open at the side. I opened it now on the zipper and on the Handykarton the protective foil was not any longer off, but lay crumpled beside it. After opening the cell phone box almost hit me to sleep, the accessories were completely available, but the phone was stolen from the box, was probably taken out of the side of the cheap packaging and put back after removing the phone. After several phone calls and e-mails with the Amazon Hotline I was told that Amazon does not replace the phone because they allegedly sent the article properly! I have turned my lawyer on and now things are going to court. So if you think Amazon would be a reputable store I have to teach unfortunately a better. I will continue to report	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	HerrHeerHerr	2	Hach, the good iPhone X;)	2017-11-12	de	Who did not look forward to Apple's new innovation? When I heard about the iPhone X, I stole the order of my iPhone 9S and flew extra to the United States to be one of the first to buy and hold such a gem. I also only had 8 days to go to the Apple Store campen.Zwar I lost my job as Minister of Defense but that was worth it in the end. Because one of the new, innovative features, such as the FaceID, with which Apple has enriched the entire future, was for me the main reason for buying the iPhone X. I'm too lazy to just unlock my phone with my finger. Although you do the phone with your fingers but the sole unlocking me completely aus.Vllt Apple is so innovative and soon developed a new iPhone, which you can control completely only with the eyes, better by telekinesis or thoughts. Would be useful for People who have no hands. Another factor would be the well-known and innovative-bristling OLED display, which is literally soo "cool" that it is sensitive to cold. In order to test this I am even together with NASA and SpaceX traveled to the distant dwarf planet Pluto, where the temperatures are below -600C.- It came out that our spaceship and all supplies froze, the iPhone X, however, ran FAST perfectly. So it was already stable, but it would have at -5 more What to consider as a counterpoint, would be Apple's pricing policy: The phone is me (unemployed) that way too cheap.Denn alone this cool and äuße most useful animation, if you push the widget aside, is in my eyes a fortune of at least € 9999 worth.

iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Kenny Maciver	1	Two replacement iPhone X's in 2 weeks ; Big Unresponsive screen Issue	2019-01-21	uk	I got an iPhone x at Xmas but began using it two weeks ago. On the second morning 15 mins after taking it off the overnight charge, the phone froze with the little spinning wheel in the middle of the screen. It rebooted itself, a process that took 10 minutes. It did the same on the second, third and fourth day, then on the fifth it did not reboot and the screen was totally unresponsive. Calls would still come in and the phone would buzz but not ring but could not be answered. Took it back to Vodafone and they replaced it.The same thing happened with the replacement and Vodafone admitted that they were experiencing similar problems all over the place. In fact the call centre lady said they must have received a bad batch and she herself had just decided to go for an alternative to the iPhone X. I happened to be in London on Saturday and took my dud phone to the Apple store in Covent Garden. Technician ran diagnostics which showed a power failure and he admitted that they were having serious issues. he kindly replaced the phone there and then.It is now Monday and horror of horrors the little spinning wheel showed up this morning, with the phone rebooting itself. I guess it will happen again tomorrow and on Thursday/Friday it will be dead again, just like the other two.The brand is getting damaged. Very expensive phone to buy that has a major screen issue. Can still use it for accessing the internet on my iPad!! The good thing is that it gets replaced with no issues and I could now write the manual on how to transfer data across from my old phone. Come on Apple we deserve a better product for this price.	0

Even with display calibration can not even set in the beginning so that it has just as a nice display as my 8 -er. In Media Markt, where I bought my XS, I compared it to other XS and X models. All the same problem. When activated by True Tone yellowish. My 8-er, as I said, is natural and not yellowish at True Tone. Incidentally, the 7, 8 and even the new i phone xr model which all have a lcd and not this new oil panel as the x, and xs models, all have not the problem with yellowish displays. Apparently I am so highly praised oled technology to lie, because although they have a perfect black value, but in contrast to Apple's lcd panels have no perfect whiteness in (self-search on the Internet) Sound: wow !!! Very audible improvement for comparison with the 8-er. Note 1 They sound full, and have good bass in the meantime iOS operating system: in itself good performance, nothing jerks running apple typically fluid, update policy more than top !! If not meanwhile these many bugs since Ios 11 einschleicjen! Apple you must those prices that you demand, will be much better again! Battery life: very clear opinion - no! In a € 1350 expensive "toy" me to deliver a battery life, at a much larger battery than the built in my i phone 8, then brings a soooo short battery life with it! No! My 8-er yes the small mind you and not the 8plus model, had in my very intensive use a battery life of 1-1 one-and-a-half days. The 1350 ¬ expensive XS model with significantly larger battery already had in the early days already so 25-28% !! Grade 6 Conclusion: I have it unfortunately to an almost 500 ¬ loss at rebuy buy and I will buy in spring / March 2019 a i phone XR, which (even convinced in the media market) win beautiful lcd panel with natural-looking colors, no yellowing gets when reue rone is activated, and in contrast to the XS model is not only much cheaper but also loud tests, you can also read the internet, has a much longer battery life than the XS models, even better than the xS ma x model and the X model from the previous year! Thank you for your time of reading, it is honest words of a normal working man, neither a so-called apple moch android "younger"	0
iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Yang	1	PHONE UNLOCK FRONT	2018-11-04	fr	We do not know if it's a new phone because the Apple warranty ends on January 26, 2019 so the phone has been activated before, normally the warranty lasts 2 years. Compared to the Apple site, it leads us to think that the Apple warranty is via the activation and deactivation. How should we take his information?	0
iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Meier Herbert	1	Never in my life an egg donor Igitigit.	2016-01-26	de	Bo Ey! What a junk scrap !!! A cell phone that bends in your pocket. For music or movies from PC on only with Eiertunes possible? Only with the control of Appel.Komisch my fun machine Galaxy S7 Edge I connect to the PC and the phone is run as a drive and invite gigabyte way drauf.Ohne any Software.Da you can see how you are ripped off by this Appel consortium .No in mine I will buy myself an eggphone.Igitigit this unit design. Against a Samsung S7 will never come along with an Appel Phone. The phone is a real fun machine. Pictures and video quality of the finest. Haptics and processing only the best. Maybe also have a look. 1 × Galaxy and you never want to return the Appel electric garbage	0
iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Grey	James	1	Beautiful phone with rubbish software	2017-06-23	uk	I got this phone as a free upgrade and it lasted 4 days before I sent it back. First thing I did was upgrade to iOS 10.3. I work on the road and my phone is everything. I installed hear maps which I always used on my s5. Voice navigation did not work. Installed Google maps, voice navigation worked for 30 minutes and only when I was on the exact route. Set a course for London from Ipswich it completely failed. Notifications had no sounds most of the time. I tried calling my provider and selecting the options on the ivr , selecting the numbers on the phone did nothing. Getting an s7 now. Like buying an Alfa, blinded by beauty but rubbish reliability under the bonnet. Never again.	0
iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	ani	1	Part u. Serial number does not even know Apple.	2018-07-23	de	What can I say that is positive, it actually came an iPhone 8 as ordered. BUT: not intended for the German market as so often (in product description and in response to customer questions) promised by the seller. To camouflage that was "sent "Placed a sticker, I called as a precaution Apple and not even knew the codes on the back. Was then too delicate and I got the phone (still original packaging, therefore no idea if it works or not) sent back. Borderline in my opinion to fraud, especially because here the identity is deliberately veiled and advertised with "mobile phones for the German market." Funny Funfact: I have waited comparatively long for the refund and therefore called Amazon. If you return a higher-quality article - even though it has arrived completely - you have to sign an affidavit first. For every nonsense you get an e-mail. I would be informed about this on demand. Which, of course, the seller now can not do anything, this point affects only Amazon itself.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Dan	1	Don't own the phone but I troubleshoot tech for it	2018-08-15	uk	So I have only used the phone around work and messed with it and at face value it's a pretty decent smartphone. But I work for a mobile company on the phones doing tech support and I have never faced so many repairs and insane issues for a phone in my life. Motherboard overheating within a month, screen repairs being £280 with other damages up to £556, camera lens after camera lens cracking, iris scanner not working and if Apple can't repair your phone in warranty you don't even get a new one you get a refurbished one. Avoid this phone at all costs please, it is a waste of money just try an S9 out or even the new Huawei (Hew-Way) phones are doing it on par with less issues and less cost.	0

Apss, which were installed about 2 years ago, can no longer be used. The developers can not expect it to adapt 3-4 times a year their program. Has Apple ever heard of a compatibility mode? Now I'm sitting on countless apps that are no longer running. THANK YOU APPLE! Not a single penny will you see more of me.	0
iPhone XR	64GB	Black	T.S.	1	More Pleasant Apple Fan	2019-04-09	de	In a nutshell: The technique of this device is the lowest cannon. I switched from an ip7s to the xr and am still disappointed 4 months after purchase. The disappointment is also getting bigger, the more software problems are added. Where should I start ? Face ID: she does not recognize me when it is too dark, when the phone is too far away from the face or when I wear sunglasses. Too: is feeling worse than from the 7s, many movements and gestures are barely or not recognized Incidentally, this device has no more 3D touch, where I think with the flashlight function you could have used this well here ... pity Resolution: if a friend shows me samsung for 150 ¬ less, sometimes I could just cry. I use and I can only warn at the moment !!! Apple says it was due to the software, but already for 3 months? Very often, one of the two Sim's.his disabled, there are no calls or text messages' But as long as you do not want to send or dial out via this number, you just do not notice it and wonder why nobody answers. The reception is still displayed normally, so there is no way to be aware of it , When the device restarts the problem is fixed. The first month everything worked and since the 2 month I have to restart the device every 2-3 days.	0

Now I have had it for a couple of months and it is working quite well, the only thing is that it overheats every now and then while I use it and I can't understand if it's a normal thing about the iPhone7 or if it's a problem with this phone in particular. I am rather unhappy with the company: I had to write over and over again before I received the receipt, and when I wrote asking what to do about the overheating problem, my question was almost ignored. In the same way I am struggling to get a precise answer on how to return during the warranty: when I asked how the additional guarantee of them works (at the time of purchase I was assured that there is a one year Apple warranty and a year with their company) they only told me to send them the phone, completely ignoring my repeated questions about the address and the procedures to follow in those cases. Is there perhaps little transparency? In any case, the phone works quite well, for now it only got me down once and I hope it's normal and not due to the model.

iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Alejandro	4	Is it worth buying it?	2018-10-20	it	* UPDATED * I purchased this new iPhone on the Apple Store online, just to try it out a little, having already an iPhone X; personally, I don't think it's worth buying, if you already have an iPhone X. This is the much-anticipated version "" S "" of the iPhone X. Let's try to understand what changes compared to the previous version and whether it's worth buying or not . Let's start by saying that there are NO big changes compared to the previous device. No news is resounding this year. The S version, as is well known, only goes to improve some aspects. Moreover, unusually, the most expensive and large "" Xs Max "" version has nothing different than the iPhone Xs, except for its size. We do not find more powerful processors or improved cameras. It's just a bigger iPhone Xs with more battery (and power consumption). I will continue to update this review as I use it. DESIGN: The iPhone Xs does not bring significant changes in design, except in the lower part where the symmetry of the holes, having added an additional antenna, to allow an enhanced reception, also given the novelty of the Dual Sim, which will be discussed later. The rear camera has been moved slightly a few millimeters higher, so the covers of the iPhone X will NOT be fully compatible with the new device. This year we also have the Gold variant. The design remains essentially unchanged, this device achieves an IP68 waterproof rating (6 indicates the maximum degree of dust resistance and 8 indicates a degree of impermeability and resistance , in case of contact with liquids, but especially with fresh water, for 30 minutes and a maximum of 2 meters deep). The guarantee of NO manufacturer, recognizes the damage caused by liquids, so it is better to refer to these specifications, considering ONLY soft water, being the liquid that causes less damage. The resistance to water and dust decreases with 'usury.PROCESSOR: The new iPhone Xs features the brand new Bionic A12 processor (retains the same marketing name as the previous A11 Bionic), but is the first smartphone processor to be built at 7 nanometers. It is equipped with 4GB of RAM, compared to the 3GB of the iPhone X, it is always equipped with 6 cores (2 high-performance and 4 high-efficiency), it has a second-generation neural engine (8-core) capable of performing 5000 billions of transactions in a second (against the 600 billion of the A11). The GPU is designed by Apple and has 4 cores against the 3 of the X. The 2 high-efficiency cores are dedicated to everyday operations, such as social media, apps, games. The 4 high-efficiency devices, on the other hand, are designed to save battery power when performing simpler operations such as chats and messages. However, when all the processor power is needed, iOS dynamically calibrates all six cores to deliver incredible performance (same as iPhone X). Thus, while performing heavy apps, such as augmented reality games or video editing, performance will be greatly improved. I do not find significant changes during everyday use compared to X. Probably, it also depends on the new operating system (iOS 12) not yet fully optimized on this new device. Both are very fast in all operations: multitasking, photos and videos, opening the app and, of course, in games .. BATTERY: Rightly, one wonders given the performance, the battery capacity. iPhone Xs is equipped with a 2658mAh battery (against the 2716mAh of iPhone X); iPhone Xs Max, on the other hand, has the largest battery an iPhone has ever had, that is 3174mAh (against the 2691mAh of the iPhone 8 Plus). iPhone Xs has less battery than iPhone X? Yes. Does it last less? At the moment, I have to say that the duration is a little lower than X, but I also think this depends on the software. FACE ID AND CAMERA: As I wrote above, the cameras are the same as the iPhone X, always with wide angle and telephoto lens with aperture focal length of ƒ / 1.8 and ƒ / 2 respectively.4. Despite this, Apple has added some features on the new Xs / Xs Max, in my opinion, for pure marketing. In fact, both these models (but also the new Xr, with single camera, released at the end of October) are able to adjust the depth of field of a photo both before shooting and in post-production and have an advanced bokeh effect . These effects are also possible on the iPhone X via the Focos app, since the cameras are identical. Change the quality of the photos in low light for the better, since the sensor of the camera has larger pixels and, we also have the smartHDR that goes to perform more shots of the same subject, combining the best parts of each shot as a result (light, movement reduction, colors); according to Apple, this, the depth of field and the boken effect are possible thanks to the new processor able to perform more operations. Nothing that the processor of the iPhone X is not able to do, but anyway .. Even the sensors of the Face ID are identical to those of the previous model, but Apple reports an improvement in the algorithm of the Secure Enclave (separate processor to encrypt biometric passwords) which guarantees a faster unlocking, despite not being a second generation Face ID. Honestly, the speed seems to me to be the same as the iPhone X, which thanks to iOS 12 is even faster and more precise in unlocking. I am absolutely satisfied in this sense.DUAL SIM: We pay attention to this very important detail. The 3 new iPhones will NOT have Dual Sim functionality in Italy. This is because it is not possible to insert 2 physical Nano Sims, since the trolley can contain only one physics, unlike the version intended for the Chinese market that will have two. How does this system work? A sim will be physical, the second sim, instead, will be based on the "" Dual Sim Dual Standby "" technology that allows you to simulate the second sim in a virtual way. This is the future, as this system will make it very easy to change the telephone or operator offer. Unfortunately, at the moment, no operator in Italy allows this function. Probably Vodafone will be the first to catch up with this technology, but not for now (the function has however been enabled by Apple with the version of iOS 12.1). Certainly it will take a few years, as has already happened with the LTE feature of the Apple Watch Series 3, arrived in Italy after about a year (Apple Watch Series 4) and supported solely by Vodafone. We will see future developments. CURRENTLY CORRECTED DEFECTS: If you have heard of the ChargeGate, know that it has been resolved with iOS 12.0.1 (it did not allow recharging, if the screen was off). According to some users, there is still a Beauty Gate that applies a sort of "" beauty filter "" automatically to selfies; in this way, the details of the face will be minimally captured, making the face look like that of a barbie. It seems to have been a bug that has just been solved with iOS 12.1. Some users also complain about an Antenna Gate, especially on the Xs Max, with poor reception in 4G / LTE and in WiFi. The WiFi part was resolved with 12.0.1, while the part concerning the antenna was solved with iOS 12.1. Obviously, in the event that this last problem occurs, Apple will replace the device, free of charge. I hope I helped you with the decision or clarified your ideas. If you have any other questions, please write me in the comments! :)	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	MRG	1	Volume knob broken at the factory	2019-01-13	de	After I had decided to spend 1220 EUR for an iPhone XS Silver, I was looking forward to the new device. Recently, I had an iPhone SE. The device makes a good visual impression, but turned out quickly that the joy will be short lived. Because the device was delivered from the factory with a broken volume knob. So if I'm currently unintentionally adjusting the volume for music or calls, there's no way to fix it. Apple has suggested sending the device and sending it back in 10 days. They would even pick it up. Alternatively, I'm allowed one day to go from Apple's election to a store and talk to a technician there. However, only at 10 o'clock in the morning. Sure, "who else is working if he can buy an iPhone for 1220", is probably the logic. I'm terribly disappointed with Apple. Only good that I ordered from Amazon: get in 2 days a replacement device and then only have to move everything again, but always have a device available.	0

This super mega-sharp Oled display can not be true white and black. It has a strong yellowish tinge that is unacceptable to me. Of course I have turned off True Tone and all that and even worked only in the shades of gray over the color filter = yellow! .All of my photos I made in SW with my Canon 5D mark4 have elaborately edited in Photoshop, are now yellowish. The SW effect of these images is now totally meaningless. Likewise, I find the reading on my iPhone 7 easier than the XS, since the contrast is clearer. Of course, I realize that the resolution of the OLED display is much higher, but this difference takes the human eye was not more.This not yet mature 1249 ¬ mobile phone I send back and I will buy the iPhone 8 mitguter old quality.	0

Function of the iPhone up to the diagnosis perfectly. So sent in and waited. After careful examination of the Apple technicians a defect of the motherboard was found. Cost of repair 330, - €! That at a time when Apple is no longer allowed to sell Iphone 7 and 8 in Germany and break the sales figures. A rogue who thinks bad things! The theme of Iphone 6s has done for me.

iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Néo	2	Iphone? I'm coming back, and that's the big disappointment ...	2018-03-09	fr	My first i-phone, and bin ouch ouch ... the last ... Nice player, I start with its 5 qualities: + fingerprint locking is top: instant, 100% good "" reading "", no more mishandling in the pocket (AP, sms, calls). All my tel will now have this system + the quality of the speakers! A very good surprise! The 7 finally had 2! Essential for the quality of calls in places a little noisy, and for listening to music. And the one from the top is towards the front (logical but not systematic!), But the one from the bottom is towards ... the bottom :( Do not understand that the quality of the sound is so neglected on ... phones! (Their basic function , no?) + waterproof IP67 (but if worry, the SAV refuses to take under warranty if they find water in it! Not honest on their part ... You are warned (e)) + autonomy (holds a day even very loaded) + application permissions: whew, as soon as they are installed, we are asked if we want to share things, and if so, it's often only when the app is used. I hated androïd for that, it seems that there has been evolution since my last androïd (went through the OS BB meanwhile: the top that disappears unfortunately) .Passons the many defects: - Speaking of BB10 precisely (including the intelligent writing system was learning my common words, correcting even a typo), the SMS writing system is really nil at Apple ... Emojis that replace words: gadget. We can not press "" in "" a word to correct it, we must go to one end and then move in the word "" sliding ""! Serious ?? And then propose 3 words only !!! As for the manipulations to just make a point, a figure ... Waw, the zero degree of practice. (and no, I do not want "" sms "") .- The camera (which I use often). Uh, yeah ... "" Live "" useless. Flash and zoom in sales. For 600 € the piece, it deserved better eh ... (only +: low light without Flash). A little worry for me I still have to take a fingertip ... That the one to whom it never happened to me launches the first stone (or a BB KeyOne, I would prefer) - The small switch on the top left sometimes puts himself alone on Silent in my pocket ... Just raging this thing. If still it was configurable ... Lamentable.- taking lightning owner ... Practice because without meaning like usb-c, but this sometimes poses problems (example: when you want to get the battery repaired by someone one that has a micro-usb charger, so common ...). It's like we have to use a different fuel gun at a gas station because we have an iCar ?! I'll have to explain the interest ....... Lamentable.- Itunes ... Who invented this thing ?? Whether for music or photos, it MUST go through this system. No choice since there is no SD player! Lamentable.- absence of led to signal the arrival of a text message, so practical yet ... Lamentable.- no induction charging on this 7.- the iphone have so many delays on androïd ... The 8 to l induction, yeah; it will be necessary to wait until the 14 to have a reader Sd? the 16 for an intelligent sms writing ?? the 24 for a led-sms ??? What joke ! Even their iphone X is missed. Steve Jobs must turn in his grave.Au final: I do not recommend at all this product, nor all iphone for that matter (opinion objective and argued: I am not a hater). Too many non-parametrible stuff, too closed (itunes, no SD player, lightning plug:), non-removable battery, too much stuff on a daily basis ... The only +, other phones on other OS the do too.

iPhone 6S	32GB	Silver	Bob Jacobson	1	Buy this phone and you prov	2019-01-26	us	Bought this model via Verizon. A piece of junk. Headphone setting woouldn’t release.  Apple couldn’t solve the problem, Apple Store replaced the phone.  Just past rhe 90 day warrantee, same problem returned. Apple Store offered $300+ examination, especially as the dial pad was now generating error messages. There is no sure remedy, however. N fact, as a knowledgeable tech guy, I found Apple’s approach and evaluation superficial, definitely NOT confidence-building. The phone still doesn’t work. A multi-hundred dollar piece of junk. You’d be nuts to buy this phone and, I suspect, any iPhone. You pay more upfront and you pay more in the longer run.  Unless you get lucky with your Chinese gear. I use an Android phone and I am sorely tempted to get a Google Book instead of a Mac. What a ripoff.	0
iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Kman	2	Produktionsengpässe? Fail.	2017-11-04	de	The alleged production bottlenecks are rich marketing tricks to make this overpriced price seem normal. Only the 1st batch may be a bit tight. If you could not pre-order one at 3.11 on the 27.10, you'll get one. 21.11 delivered. If you order now after 1 week or after the release only at Apple, it also gets from 21.11.It is the first time that the user experience has deteriorated significantly in an iPhone, because the removal of Home Button brings significantly more disadvantages with the omission of the jack connector. The 5.8 "" display on the paper is even larger than 8plus with 5.5 "". In practice, most apps / videos are not adapted to this stretched ratio. Anyone who has become accustomed to Plus devices, the X-display would be much too small, because areas at upper and lower edges can be hardly used effectively. In the area 5G (if 5g as planned from the end of 2018 standard) X is far behind Note 8 and Huawei mate 10, future-proof in 1 or 2 years, the device is not. With such a 1149-1319 euro device it is already a bit poor. Clearly many problems can be eliminated in the future via software update, if the app developers are already, extra time for a single device variant to invest, nevertheless X is in actual form really no mature product. In China, reseller prices are already just below OVP. It will not be long before the customers come to their senses again and realize how overpriced this Protype is and can not even sell for 500 euros in half a year.	0
