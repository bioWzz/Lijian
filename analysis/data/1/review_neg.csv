I changed my iphone 6 by the XS. In my opinion, the technical characteristics are a bit below my expectations. Parcel simply deposited in the mail, considering the price is light, especially "delivered against signature" at the time of the order.	0

I was pleased but as soon as it is put into service, it does not work. I can not turn it off or turn it on. I have not had the opportunity to use it. Very disapointed.	0
Phone supposedly new but already configured and Dutch !!! So already lit. And when we reset the phone we discover a remote access guided application. Which means they can handle the entire phone remotely. The worst thing is that the app does not work and the touch does not respond at all. The seller's answer (the phone is under warranty go to the nearest Apple Store) phone that is supposed to be new but has to go directly for repair. Seller to run away !!!	0
Extremely disappointed, certainly Iphone arrived in time for Christmas but fun spoiled. The iphone has stuck with my personal data, obviously part of a company fleet. I have never seen that ... and Apple either!	0
flee APPLE flee AMAZON I had a problem with my phone XS MAX after 1 week of use it work more I send it for a repair he asks me to pay 681e for an oxidation I find it inadmissible for a phone that is said to go under the water while I just took the rain the warranty does not take into account suddenly the phone comes back to 2000th fuyezzzzzzzz !!!!!!!!	0

Product bought November 28 it arrived very quickly and the price was very interesting. But very quickly the phone went off on its own for no reason ... So I went to an Apple store where it was found that there was a problem in the motherboard where the only solution was to make a total exchange of the phone ...	0
Big disappointment, it was supposed to be "" like new "" and "" in perfect condition "" ... In fact, and in many places, it is really marked, the steel is scratched or depressed. see frankly and that feels when you put your finger on these places! So, big disappointment.	0

I should have bought it from Amazon and not from Orange ... this smartphone is overpriced for outdated technical specifications, so buy the 8 cheapest XR in comparison has no interest. the image quality is well behind that of the Xs and especially samsung and Huawei, Face ID is a calamity, 3 times out of 10 you have to do its code while it was so simple with the thumbprint and the central button . finished double click on the central button to see his apps open it is a complicated gesture that must be done 2 to 3 times and gives seasickness ... it is painful. When weight is the volume, it's a truck! very heavy and difficult to handle, only positive thing the battery holds the day (would miss more than that you say!). the "truck" escaped me from broken screen hands, the cost of repair announced by Apple store operated 329 € because of the famous Face ID. In short Apple is not what it was, I do not really like Google and its intrusive side but frankly it does not make sense to buy an XR. Rest a good OS and service, the best is to buy on amazon a 7 or 8 until applle recovers, unless ...	0
Deplorable	0
I was used to my SE and hoped for more visual comfort with the Xr. The screen is certainly much larger but too heavy to hold with one hand so ultimately not practical at all. I come back happy to my SE that works just as quickly.	0
The product is very good, it works perfectly and conforms to the expected characteristics of an iPhone X. However, when I ordered this phone, the description indicated that it was a new product (its price indicated it also), but at the reception I had some doubts and went to inquire directly in the Apple Store, where I was told that this product had already been used ... I then tried to contact the seller, but impossible to reach him ... for months I'm trying, no way to reach him.	0
Reconditioned product, at this price there may be required a new as announced in the description! And delivery made to a neighbor ...	0
The reception was well done, package well packed no problem in delivery but after a few days of use I start to notice something quite vicious. I did not notice the first few days but after being attentive to the details I realize that on the 3 outputs of sounds one does not work (the one at the bottom left of the phone) the same battery discharges much too fast compared iPhone that I previously had while the use is the same. Very strange for "new" iPhone. I'm waiting for a refund!	0
Reconditioned product	0
Too late and it did not last long	0
Very fragile materials and slippery coating. Color of lumiiness rather yellowish .... Apple and me, it's really finished! Too expensive for a gadget that does not ultimately grancesse thing. Can be animated emoji ?!	0

I bought this iPhone X saying "" new "" and it was damaged by water, afterwards an expert certified me that this phone was a reconditioned. I do not recommend.	0
Iphone returned under scello, no refund for 34 days. Thief, legal proceedings planned	0
My iPhone was supposed to arrive there 4 days ago, but I still have no sign of my package. A MAJ will be made when I have the iPhone in hand.	0
Acceptable lead time, other than that the packaging is mediocre! pack in a simple bubble wrap the phone could have been shocked at any time, the phone itself is in a very average condition, scratch more wear on the side, is the height and the charger iphone included with is a vulgar cable adaptable iphone chinese quality. it is inadmissible in view of the price of the phone of nearly 700e even if it is used to receive and see this type of thing. I do not recommend the seller at all. The phone is delivered alone, without box, earpiece, charger, and instructions. (only with a cable that I do not advise to connect with)	0
NEVER RECEIVED	0
I received both broken protections. Product return...	0
A short time after buying the phone, part of the screen stops responding, and the salesperson told me: I'm sorry to learn for your phone, go to a manufacturer's store to run the warranty. 'y go and the Apple Store tell me that the warranty does not work !! I return an email to the seller hoping that now it does something !!!!!!! FOR THE MOMENT SELLER TO FUIR !! FUCK POOR CRAZY !!! ^^	0
Empty package in the invalid mailbox	0
Bought at Smart Tech Electronics, 100% scam, empty packaging with some kind of paste in it, no phone or accessories	0
This product buve a week after receiving it: black screen at times, speakers sizzle when I mounts the sound (call or music), I hear badly by phone, facial recognition no longer works and for unlock it is very long. The seller took a long time to find a solution (and to respond to AMAZON agents when they wrote him an email to do the necessary). The first complaint for defective product is early July, we are August 14, I visited that same day in an Apple Store (Bordeaux) who confirmed that there was an anomaly of facial recognition: they told me traded in 20 minutes against a new one. Thanks APPLE!	0
I received the iPhone X but unfortunately I realized that the phone is not new: it is a phone surely reconditioned or used, but it was not specified on the ad, it was written "NINE" and not "AS NEW" (suddenly even if I recognize that the external state of the phone is impeccable it still impossible to determine the wear of the phone, its components ...). accessories delivered with are not official (not the Apple brand), besides the headphones do not work.I confess to be disappointed ... Result for a phone to almost 1100 euros I tell myself that the quality / price ratio n is not terrible.	0
He sells refurbished phones and not nine fingerprints visible more he does not answer claims to escape absolutely ....	0
Super I bought this phone 15 days ago, since I have people hear me very badly when I speak I thought it was due to the thickness of my protective shell and I just call AppleCare who told me that my microphone is defective !!! I just contacted Amazon to make a file and I hope that the seller makes me exchange very quickly because the price of the phone is unbearable ...	0
I kept my iPhone X a year and I resigned myself to return to a model with digital recognition, I never adapted to the facial recognition. The unlock is almost instantaneous on an iPhone 8 by pressing the Home button on the screen. iPhone X must: 1- that the device understands all one wants to unlock it by analyzing the movements of the device, often either he understands nothing at all, or it triggers facial recognition too early. 2- You have to catch the small tab at the bottom of the screen and put it up so as to indicate to the phone that you want to use it (I never understood why they put this step) If we add the many editors of apps that have not updated their apps for the screen of the iPhone X and the repeated bugs of iOS on iPhone X, I can say that it is with undisguised joy that I return to the iPhone 8.	0
No box, no earphone, no AC outlet. Green the phone is in good condition and works. But in the end there is a scam on the price. Because to sell it is dead ...	0
Unacceptable. The phone received today leaves for refund. FaceId does not work, the phone once activated is not recognized for the guarantee, moreover, the blister packs the iPhone is not the "real" apple.	0
The iphone was new as indicated / complete box / however series of the iPhone faulty at the battery level so the same evening after recovering the iphone was no longer working ... Apple store / depot / new phone nine after 8 hours - impeccable apple service!	0
The phone arrived in a cardboard in poor condition and we are certified that it is new when he was not even in blister! It's a scam	0
He sometimes drunk	0

The phone has a defect of assembly.The join between the glass and the metal hangs to the touch.A device at this price there! In addition, for the delivery one makes you pay 10 euros To have it at a precise date what was not the case!	0
The phone is good overall but breaks very fast is it is too big.Il not more and the memory wears quickly	0
I already bought with A-MONTAIN the same product in black and I had no problem. I do not understand I get a fake iphone x (very well done) I quickly recognized I asked refund and I would not order more with this seller because I am really disappointedMes arguments: -barre down and up (he should just have black in the center at the top and there are everywhere) they want us to believe that it is a real by putting the little black tip on the wallpaper-the assistant touch in the form of round (it must be square) -and the reminder for lack of battery that is not at all apple-noises (lights / screen / photo / low battery)	0
A shame, a so-called new iPhone is actually reconditioned and failed after three months of use without perceiving shocks!	0
It is not the iPhone obviously that is a pure gem, I bought it at the Fnac, it's safer.NO, IT IS A SCRATCH THAT SEATS ON THE NET VERY SKILL BY OFFERING THE 256 GB CLASSIC PRICE, EXCEPT THAT THE SMARTPHONE DOES NOT ARRIVE.AMAZON PREVENTED THE HOPE I ESPEREAMAZON ALWAYS REFURBISHED "" RUBBISH ON THE NAIL	0
Purchase not checked because received for work.Les plus: - it is pretty-the screen is very beautiful, nothing to complain about. The colors are vivid.- excellent reactivity of the screen. But nothing transcendent, any smartphone half the price has the same responsiveness / fluidity - the battery is long. Two and a half days in high use but no games.- sync mails / outlook / contacts less broken head than on Android.- excellent camera.Level of flat keys: - no micro SD- no button. Extreme slowness at the level of manipulation. We want to close an application? Press for a long time at the bottom of the screen, long press on the window, wait until the small red crosses appear, close one by one applications.- without buttons it is also necessary to do additional manipulations to navigate from an application to the other, to go back on a web page etc.- nice facial recognition but if it does not work (glasses), you have to wait until recognition does not work, wait to put the code etc ...- obligation to go through iTunes to listen to music.- headphones without jack cable. So you have to either discard the iPhone headphones and use the jack cable adapter to iPhone, or have two pairs, one for the iPhone, one for the computer ... To conclude, the battery, the screen and the camera is really at the top, but tedious navigation (what is faster to do anything on an Android ...), the headphones unusable other than on the phone, and the lack of flexibility at the level of music and storage make the price is absolutely not justified and is there only to give some exclusivity to its owner, which is ridiculous.Je have not had other phones too high-end but I'm certain that for € 3-400 less (which is extremely expensive) you can enjoy the same quality without having to suffer the limitations imposed by Apple	0
product reconditioned slow and scratched .... disappointed by my friends I went to Samsung and I took the s8 I did not have a hard time doing I am very satisfied qualities to go for a lot less cherune ex-consumer	0
Disappointed by the quality / finish considering the price	0
Unbeatable price, 100% brand new iPhone (verified on kelpom.fr which also gives the date of manufacture) ATTENTION SEE MORE BASIPhone bought on Amazon in August and manufactured in May of the same year so very satisfied! 1 year standard Apple warrantyYou can darker! Edit of 04/09: my iPhone is a reconditioned APPLE (serial number starting with C7): I had the chip by ear seeing the 2 screws a little worn by the screwdriver. The serial number confirmed it to me on chipmunk.nl, which I did not find 'right away.	0
Hello I am amazed to have an iPhone 8 Plus 256g and have received an iPhone 8. The title of the Amazon ad is perfectly clear. Even the return of the product is under the label "iPhone 8plus 256g" How is this possible? And just a return for such an error ... I'm stunnedI put a star by obligation	0
It's anything, I was given an iphone 8 and not an 8 plus, the screen is tiny and not a 5.5 inch screen	0
I have a problem with my camera bloke when I take a picture before I try to reach you but it's in English I do not know how to do it	0
Scandalous !!!! After 3 months, the capacity of the battery is already down to 95% which is not NORMAL. She loses 1% broken every day for 3 days while its price is still very high !!!!! Knowing that I charge my phone 1 time a day and especially never at night not to damage the battery. Unfortunately even with his efforts, nothing makes it look like a refurbished phone. I did not buy an IPhone to almost 700 € for the battery to be dead after 7 months.	0
It is not about Iphone 8 Plus but a classic Iphone 8! The title of the product is misleading and I still have no news of my return product after more than 15 days! I strongly advise against!	0
We do not know if it's a new phone because the Apple warranty ends on January 26, 2019 so the phone has been activated before, normally the warranty lasts 2 years. Compared to the Apple site, it leads us to think that the Apple warranty is via the activation and deactivation. How should we take his information?	0

This is not an iPhone 8 Plus, but an iPhone 8 that has been sent.	0

Defective item after a year and a half (battery HS) and seller (RH Mobiles) that does not respond to emails for the warranty. Apple can not do anything and Amazon does nothing!	0
A REAL CATASTROPHE !!! Everything seemed to be fine. I got the phone and everything was fine until I tried to use the camera that did not work. Amazon asked me to send it back using their return system. It's been more than a month since Amazon received the phone in its warehouses and since the customer service does not hang in my face, I'm asked to justify sending, that the package was not empty, now that the phone has not been replaced by another. In short, I'm called a thief and a liar without explanation. I am a good Amazon customer usually but here I will stop everything.	0
iPhone top, but he died after 1 year to the day ... damage	0
Product received nickel but very unhappy because the iPhone does not work impossible to light .. Scam !!	0
A little disappointed knowing that the sound does not work.	0

It's been a month since I bought the iphone, but I have the impression that there is something weird on the phone ... first, the ecrin is already scratched (not normal for an iPhone) and secondly ... the apeles FaceTime cut off all the time, I will try to play the guarantee ... because the stripes have no place to be, I always had iPhones, and it is the first time I see this! ... it makes me doubt the authenticity of the product	0
Hello, I do not know if this is an error or a scam but I have only received headphones and a phone charger instead of an IPHONE8.Can I enlighten quickly?	0
If you have like me received via Amazon an Iphone 7 or 8 that does not have a model number in ZD, for me it was Russian RN! So find any fake excuse of malfunction in Apple store and the shop will exchange it directly !! And then you will have an Iphone in ZD instead :)	0
From the unpacking, I could see that there was a pb because the film on the phone was dusty.Once the protective film removed I could immediately see two scratches at the bottom of the screen! So here is obviously used phone / refurb sold as a new phone. Direct return to Amazon who refunded me within ten days.	0
No comments because I keep a very bad experience on the delivery method.Du Blanc-Mesnil (delivery center); in Stains, it's 20 minutes by van.	0
I received the open phone with less accessories.I am really not satisfied with this device okay j	0
I just received the package this morning (Saturday), The big surprise: I open and I do not find my Iphone 8 but a pack of powder! I am very angry and disappointed and I feel scammed! The delivery failed twice (Thursday and Friday) on the pretext that the driver finds the door of the building is closed (like all buildings !!!!), without even try to call me. Then I call Amazon on Friday to tell them that the driver does not call me to open him and they schedule a new delivery on Saturday. Saturday morning I stay at home and wait for a while and I will check my mailbox in case and boom I find the package! Without even I sign it drops! so glad to receive my iphone 8 I do not pay attention to this detail .. and I go open the package quickly to be surprised by its content! powder !!!!! a packet of powder with a net pea of ​​500g! Calling them, Amazon can do nothing for me since it is the weekend and I have to wait until next Wednesday! I do not know what to do anymore !!	0
I bought this iPhone at the beginning it worked well, just after the screen Bug, the microphone is defective, disaster saw the price I expected better and more customer service	0
Hello, Why in the description of this model phone is marked micro sim card, but the phone works with a nano sim I ordered my micro sim card and it does not fit, so I had to order another. Remember to mark consistent information in the description, thank you	0
I do not know if it comes from the fact that it is unlocked, the screen of the iiphone suddenly became black and does not turn on for days. However the home button vibrates but the screen remains black.I do not know if I have to send it back to TBE or ask notice at Apple to find out if it is under warranty ... An iPhone cheap of course, but problems by afterwards very sad to have lost 680 euros	0
Hello, I usually do not write bad reviews in my life in general. But today my discontent is strong, I ordered early September this article. Already for starters I received a Hwawei P10 instead. So I forwarded the item back and asked for a refund, Amazon told me that the refund may take several weeks !!!! (Nothing to do with the 2 to 3 worked cheeks information). Instead of making an exchange I had to, if not have a phone, recommended 1, or a total of 1560 €! We are on October 10th, one month after the receipt of my return and I am still not reimbursed. It's shameful, Amazon should pay LAO ....	0
So I attribute the rating of a star, for the simple reason that the iphone is not new! Box already open, so really disappointed for a product priced.I therefore recommend the purchase , mistrust.	0
Do not change the other iPhone 6.7! If you want to change, go for X, which is different because of its novelty and its design.	0
This is my first iPhone bought three months agoSo there I was satisfied but I encountered a problem the front camera does not work anymore ... Damage to a smartphone "premimum"	0
The iPhone 8 meets my requirements I am very happy against the seller announces a model number that is not at all the one received from or the wrong rating. I received a template for Eastern Europe. I hope I do not have a warranty, it does not reassure me	0
Thank you Amazon for this beautiful Soviet IPhone, you should make it clear that the phone is basically destined for the Eastern European market. But no it's true, you'd have a lot fewer customers. This is the last I buy an iPhone on Amazon.	0
Product very well received, very fast but big problem I left the laptop charged 1 full day and the batteire remains at 0%. I tried the charger on another laptop and it works well. Please tell me the procedure to do thank you	0
As "Hikaru" says in his comment of January 31, 2018, I also received an iPhone 8 model (MQ6G2CN / A) for the Czech market, shipped and sold by Amazon though. On the characteristics it is noted that the product is for the French market according to the model number (MQ6G2ZD / A). I ​​tried to contact the customer service in vain at the time of writing: no answer despite several mails !!! I have to put the product into operation next weekend because it is for my daughter and I do not know if this model will pose a problem of use in France and what it is of the Apple warranty. In summary, very disappointed, and yet I have been a good customer for many years; I wonder if I will not return the article ...	0
Still not received my phone yet to order on July 12th. That's great	0
Hello, I order an iPhone 8 Plus Gray sidereal and I get an iPhone 8 GOLD! A huge difference in price and a nice waste of time (2 weeks with the return and refund time) I'm totally amazed! (without word games with the phone's colors)	0

So how did I evaluate a product that was not delivered to me? I think it's a bit complicated no? In any case on the picture, it looks really good.	0

Order not received. It's just theft.	0
Hello, I must say that I am very disappointed or angry to the extent that I bought 779 euros this iPhone 8 Plus and today, by clicking on this order for a friend, the iPhone is now at 753 euros, 26 euros less than just two days ago, I have the impression of being a victim of dishonesty.	0
I received a model of iPhone 8 (MQ6G2CN / A) for the Czech market, shipped and sold by Amazon I specify.So after the follow it comes from Germany, and yet on the description card it is well noted that the product is for the French market according to the model (MQ6G2ZD / A). It's not serious!	0

Apple, commercial practices more than abusive but still legal! The new Mac High Sierra and IOS 11 operating systems for itune and iphone are real viruses for your devices over 2 years old! In addition, Apple Care is recruiting a team that has no technical skills to help you solve your problems. problems and will not offer you especially any commercial solution! "" Normal "" will you say, this is precisely their new branding strategy! The planned obsolescence of Apple products is a reality that I have refused to see until it impacts me directly. I am writing this post to prevent others from throwing their money out the window . I have an iphone 6 plus a Mac Book Air and a Super Drive (external DVD player). I had 2 weeks ago the unfortunate act of updating my iphone which worked perfectly on IOS 10 to IOS 11.2.5. Since my phone is less responsive than the one I owned 10 years ago. The applications take looooooooooyear seconds to open, take a photo quickly is impossible, sent a message remains possible if you are not disturbed by the fact that it appears only after you have typed 10 Phrases.I contact the assistance Apple (the story is abbreviated because it took me 9 calls of 2h including 1h systematic waiting, spread over 2 weeks, to obtain the poor result that I will describe you): The assistance tells me to restore my iphone to fix the problems. To do this, an update of itune is necessary, but in order to achieve the update of itune I must first update the operating system of my Mac because none of the sytems were compatible between them. I'm running (with you imagine it much trouble because nothing works as indicated by employees of Apple). After several nights of updates, my iphone is finally restored and all my systems are up to date. ... Finding: My iphone is still slow and my Mac on the latest version High Sierra no longer recognizes my Super Drive (which can not be updated) .I spend my last night on the phone with Apple who does not offers no solution and hangs up leaving me in total disarray (I forgot to mention that my interlocutors have all tried to charge me their package of assistance for products no longer under warranty). To conclude, Si you do not want to spend 800 to 2500 euros for a phone or computer every two years and buy accessories at an exorbitant price that become obsolete after 6 months ... FUY !!!!!! Any other smartphone provider is doing better than Apple now! Apple, I hope this post will continue to complete your reputation so that others do not get caught up in your vast scam. The only time I will lose with you now will be the one I need to propagate this message as widely as possible.KindlyAn ex-consumer.	0
The price is excessively expensive, it's the same aspect as the iphone 6, there is just the chip a11 that boosts performance and a better camera but it is not worth this sum clearly not, prefer an iphone 7 plus or the iphone 7	0
This is absolutely not an iphone 8 anymore. It's an Iphone 8. So I have to send it back.	0
Before buying, I told amazon that I was assured that it was the iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB, because the picture corresponds to the iPhone 8. The ASIN code also corresponds to the iPhone 8.Je I still bought it.The 256GB model is not the 8 Plus.It is the normal version of the iPhone 8. Amazon did not believe to have received the iPhone 8 instead of the Iphone 8 Plus. He opened an incident for confirmation. I returned the article. I'm waiting for the refund I hope everything is fine	0

I write this comment 1 year after receiving my phone. It is broken down today. I wanted it repaired by Apple since it was still under warranty but since the product was not bought in France the warranty does not chew on him! I do not recommend buying it here if you want to be able to repair it!	0
My iphone 7 m 'has cost 681 euros, bought at Topprice24. After 13 months, it does not work at all, and it is no longer guaranteed! The Apple warranty only covers the first year, and the seller does not guarantee the second year, although it is European !! I would have liked to know before buying it. So salesman to flee !!!	0
May be bad luck but the phone received worked 1h before turning off permanently.Apple does not want to exchange because electronic parts have been changed .... But no worries with amazon for the return and refund	0
Bad experience with this seller PURE IT COM !!! To flee	0

Very bad product after only 3 months of use the phone does not work as it should beug to repetion and other problem	0
Barely two months of use and I already see anomalies on the phone. It does not lock (programmed to 3min yet), it blinks ... yes yes never seen that!	0
My first i-phone, and bin ouch ouch ... the last ... Nice player, I start with its 5 qualities: + fingerprint locking is top: instant, 100% good "" reading "", no more mishandling in the pocket (AP, sms, calls). All my tel will now have this system + the quality of the speakers! A very good surprise! The 7 finally had 2! Essential for the quality of calls in places a little noisy, and for listening to music. And the one from the top is towards the front (logical but not systematic!), But the one from the bottom is towards ... the bottom :( Do not understand that the quality of the sound is so neglected on ... phones! (Their basic function , no?) + waterproof IP67 (but if worry, the SAV refuses to take under warranty if they find water in it! Not honest on their part ... You are warned (e)) + autonomy (holds a day even very loaded) + application permissions: whew, as soon as they are installed, we are asked if we want to share things, and if so, it's often only when the app is used. I hated androïd for that, it seems that there has been evolution since my last androïd (went through the OS BB meanwhile: the top that disappears unfortunately) .Passons the many defects: - Speaking of BB10 precisely (including the intelligent writing system was learning my common words, correcting even a typo), the SMS writing system is really nil at Apple ... Emojis that replace words: gadget. We can not press "" in "" a word to correct it, we must go to one end and then move in the word "" sliding ""! Serious ?? And then propose 3 words only !!! As for the manipulations to just make a point, a figure ... Waw, the zero degree of practice. (and no, I do not want "" sms "") .- The camera (which I use often). Uh, yeah ... "" Live "" useless. Flash and zoom in sales. For 600 € the piece, it deserved better eh ... (only +: low light without Flash). A little worry for me I still have to take a fingertip ... That the one to whom it never happened to me launches the first stone (or a BB KeyOne, I would prefer) - The small switch on the top left sometimes puts himself alone on Silent in my pocket ... Just raging this thing. If still it was configurable ... Lamentable.- taking lightning owner ... Practice because without meaning like usb-c, but this sometimes poses problems (example: when you want to get the battery repaired by someone one that has a micro-usb charger, so common ...). It's like we have to use a different fuel gun at a gas station because we have an iCar ?! I'll have to explain the interest ....... Lamentable.- Itunes ... Who invented this thing ?? Whether for music or photos, it MUST go through this system. No choice since there is no SD player! Lamentable.- absence of led to signal the arrival of a text message, so practical yet ... Lamentable.- no induction charging on this 7.- the iphone have so many delays on androïd ... The 8 to l induction, yeah; it will be necessary to wait until the 14 to have a reader Sd? the 16 for an intelligent sms writing ?? the 24 for a led-sms ??? What joke ! Even their iphone X is missed. Steve Jobs must turn in his grave.Au final: I do not recommend at all this product, nor all iphone for that matter (opinion objective and argued: I am not a hater). Too many non-parametrible stuff, too closed (itunes, no SD player, lightning plug:), non-removable battery, too much stuff on a daily basis ... The only +, other phones on other OS the do too. My first and last iphone.	0
The iPhone received a problem at the speaker level next to the camera, the sounds seem to come from behind the phone, even with the sounds thoroughly, test with multiple calls ...	0
I am really very disappointed it was a nice gift for my son but it's a horror the phone is just bumble and the screen is just to freeze it is not worth it	0
I ordered an iPhone 7 and received a poster from Justin Bieber. What is this joke. Right away I returned the article.	0
Brand new phone under blisterA few days of use my battery does not hold the charge 50% of charge lost in one night without wifi or Bluetooth	0
I received the iPhone with a box in the box not a French sector! It's a shame, fortunately I had what it takes	0
Device delivered in a plastic bag, without its box and without accessories contrary to what is indicated. A large scratch at the top right of the screen that was not indicated. I still paid 500 euros !!.	0
Too expensive for the price of the phone offers a better life for much less expensive I would never buy apple again	0
I order the iPhone and after 2 weeks of use not even the microphone does not work when called me jentent what I am told and we do not lie I'm not satisfied with my purchase	0
This iPhone works well. But his autonomy was really catastrophic. The energy is discharging too fast during the night, about 60% each night, although it is in airplane mode! Another thing I do not like is that there is a small task in the camera on the back. In any case, I changed a new iPhone to Apple Stores	0
Two iphone bought, one was defective. We had to go change it at APPLE. Disappointing for a new products a few weeks ago	0
iPhone died after 13 months !!! And the warranty is only a year !!!!! So I am very disappointed.	0
I bought this phone and I am not satisfied. The camera, it works so bad, feeling bad to choose the seller, totally dissatisfied with the phone camera	0
The phone itself has good but against since I had this phone I got hacked my account at least 4 times so I changed my card from. I advise people who want iPhone to take it in store is better much better	0
450 iPhone 7 ?????? I see that there are comments but have nothing to do with the buyers of the product you offer.Moreover, YOU do not respond to messages left about the request for more information ..... an iPhone 7 at its new release, it does not exist .... scam? Amazon should check this ...	0
I do not recommend at all the phone is actually reconditioned despite the mention "nine" amazon, it just refurbish the appearance and blister, they recover old phones and just change the outside, I strongly recommend the battery is bad everything is changed, nothing is original except the outside.	0
RENDERED, MISSED THE SHEET, AND IT WAS THE COMMANDER ..... DOMMAGENous we made the product, and in town, less interestingBelle journéeMONA	0
second purchase in 24 hours of a reconditioned iphone, two galleys!	0
I have always been a fan of Apple, but now, the competition is very strong. At this price we have a much more powerful smartphone on Android with an onboard screen. Today when I released my iphone 7 I felt like I was going back 5 years. Apart from their incredible operating system, the rest is paid marketing at the price of perfumes.Il is more real innovation since the death of Steeve Job, and yet iPhones increases, Samsung benefits and increases the But beware of the Chinese competition !!! Samsung has for him the most innovative design but pain with overcoats. Except the last at first sight!	0
Iphone 6 and 6s make the same pictures of the same quality !!, have the same autonomy! , have a speaker that does not shake the whole phone !!! and have a much nicer home button that does not vibrate half the phone for nothing! Save several hundred euros by keeping or taking an iphone 6 or 6s! iphone7 returned and refunded	0
iphone 7 received well on time but big problem there is no manual in French, really bad considering the price of the iphone.	0
Like an iphone 6 except that, as there is no jack, forget the fact of listening to music with good quality dessus.adapter jack is bad, I had some very good headsets, nothing to do, with the adapter the sound comes out wrong, no depth, unpleasant, without roundness, ... a sound a little typed beats now that I think, ie violently Really badI still do not understand how they make to sell as expensive this phone, it's my last I phone, next such I go to Samsung, Sony or Huawei	0
A real stole bole, already it takes 2 years before having a real change with their marketing con the famous "" s "" involving their slogans: "" 2x faster 2x more powerful "" iPhone 3 = > iPhone 3GSiPhone 4 => iPhone 4siPhone 5 => iPhone 5siPhone 6 => iPhone 6sIt ​​is not necessary to be in a hurry with Apple before having a revolution! And now they are charging us with an iPhone 7 that is only managing an iPhone 6 / 6s improved ... as digit as usual, a little more powerful here, a little more powerful by the ... and here is the new iPhone! But where is the break, or is the change of design , or is the revolution ??? Let us dream, put us on the screen curved, borderless or even flexible ... 3D, picoprojection, phone extra fine. In short, finally created a break !!!! My conclusion for the iPhone: A disappointment, a rail rattle.	0
I did not encounter any problem with the phone itself. I was aware that the phone was a Refurbished however I found that there was a lot of blow to the contours of the phone. On the description you are told that the shots are minor and does not interfere with the operation it remains very vagueThat was not clarified that we would not have the phone box and the original charger and taken to put wall. Instead we had a simple charger to connect to USB .... that will probably not work long In general when we see a phone is the box there frankly I do not understand too much.I asked the seller he replied that he did not speak very good French and that considering the price of the phone it was normal that they do not provide the box and charger. It's not really the problem it's just that if c is not written we do not know and it is disappointing if one day we come to resell it will be complicated without the box	0
I ordered the IPhone 7 Plus, the phone dropped me after 2 months not even! The battery does not hold, the screen has started to drop, I send back the phone!	0
I bought an iPhone 7 Plus unlocked for Christmas at this seller.But in fact the phone is blocked at a German operator.It is not possible to use this iPhone with a French SIM.Ca looks very close to a scam of the seller who proceeds in this way to sell the phones a little cheaper.I contacted the seller who confirmed that the phone was blocked, he offered to wait for the date of release of the operator planned a month later ... It's just outrageous.	0
Since the purchase of this phone I note small annoying bug which leads me to wonder if the phone is new as shown on the advertisement!	0
Hello I can not activate liphon there is saa that his spell on the screen	0
Cell phone problem of sound	0
A little disappointed My phone bug so much! That I have to make an appointment at apple for a repair.	0
Adept of the iphone for ten years, For this price, it is lamentable. Price / performance do not even deserve a star.Since the SHIFT mid October 2017 = 11.0.3, it's a disasterMulti bugs, and to reset, whether with itune, icloud, a real gas plant. only with software tier (anytrans) that I was able to reinstall a backup, But it is impossible to retrograder in IOS 10. ... which worked very well. Mine is still guaranteed a week, I went in a apple center which informs me that a change of MAJ will be available end of October, But they lost my confidence, it is irreversible.For the price of the iphone, I bought my children two galaxy S8 more. more beautiful, powerful and the photos are more beautiful. moreover we do what we want, it is not locked as apple.Après warranty I jailbreak, like my old iphone, a real breath of air.I wrote to the seller, basically it's dammed you with apple. IS MY LAST IPHONE? NEVER AGAIN !!!	0
Pay so much for his?!?! It is distressing whereas much cheaper smartphones are largely better and performant like the honor 6x pro for example. Apple places a lot of emphasis on the camera in ads when it's only 12 megapixels. It has only 4 hearts while other much cheaper in 8. In short 900 € for old components, I laughed well	0
I learned a lot if the box is equipped with a charger English sector it is just wrong! Open safari and you'll see open settings and information and you will see that it is iOS 9!	0
Jack adapter not supplied with the phone	0
Iphone 7 plus bought just a month ago for a fortune, it is a refurbished device given the problems: you type on the screen a sms, it suddenly opens an application, the battery is discharge in a few hours, so we must switch to battery saving mode, ie the same features as an Iphone 5. The screen remains frozen in panoramic mode, well, in short, the list is long ... When you contact the salesman you are told: "" address yourself to Apple "". Kind nothing to do with your fate after you have cheated.	0
I bought for my daughter an I-Phone 6s with the mention "" NINE "". After 2 weeks, the device breaks down. Going to Apple's Genius Bar, my daughter learns that the device is a refurbished device and that any repairs are at my expense. It is therefore a very negative experience and a false sale. I will send it back and ask for a refund. The seller is not reliable.	0
Battery does not hold the charge. Insecure screen and impervious dust seal. Total scam. Products does not correspond to the description. Nothing works properly	0
I bought this phone for my 16 year old daughter.Quality of the camera disappointing device out of order after 6 months.I let you imagine her disappointment.	0
My iPhone is brand new and yet it bug very oftenI wonder if it is not refurbished	0
Very disappointed with the battery lifeI think I sold a reconditionne and not a new one	0
Total dissatisfaction! I bought it new at a high price in February 2019 or 3 months and it overheats. Indeed, it has a manufacturing defect. I brought him today to Apple who changed me for a refurbished. So I'm disgusted I will not buy iphone on Amazon anymore.	0
I bought this phone with confidence given the fact that it is an AmazonRecu certified seller in perfect condition, nickel installation, but with the activation of my GSM chip? , no network ... Call my operator, This is a black phone listed ,,, so stole somewhere and resold as a phone reconditioned by a thug on Amazon ..... Dishonest or unscrupulous seller ... .. do not buy here !!	0

The phone has stopped working after 3 months of use	0
I do not recommend iPhones .. Their batteries do not fit. I have an iPhone 6 and I changed the battery 2 times in 3 years. My phone has been bought nine. Some iPhone fan will tell you because c ' he let it plugged all night etc .. and bin no I let him charge 3 hours max to reach 100%. Here I am watching a video of 10 minutes and I find myself at 93%. I go on facebook 10 minutes c the same in less than 2 hours I find myself in energy saving mode (- 20%) .Good courage otherwise.	0
It is a very good device, full of vices hidden since its purchase, all the time hacked because we give the personal info supposedly obliged to be assisted. During the request for identification to the server, he does not recognize any more the serial number because there is an error every time, after screen sharing with most remote assistants at apple, full of problems, be sure that they pause when you put your password ... because he always finds ways to distract you to integrate on your device, if you bought your device on the internet, the risk is 80%, because they took your serial number, all applications are problematic, you will certainly have the same people without you noticing to help you when you are down. It's a scourge, I have two iMacs and iPhone, everything is contaminated with a single cloud cloud ID , so-called uper well protected, but not all purchases made on a private site are all gone. The network of all these problems is in the Isle of France.	0
very good condition but broken rear shell tips	0
Not at all satisfied with my purchase, and for good reason; drums !!! indeed in standby mode it does not last much more than 45-50 hours.Other functions like the ID key that has almost never worked (2-3 days) and so on !!! In any case I do not will not recommend it ....	0
Iphone 6s 32gb SilverI order this on Wednesday night around 20h. I received them on Friday morning! it's fast !! For me it's a FALSE IPHONE. (The little writing on the back of the box and the FLAKE OF COLOR BIZARD.The photo camera has beug of the 2nd day .. But I can be wrong) Apart from it requires a different SIM card (very small apeller NanoSIM). And I had 24.90 euro delivery fee! Personally I will be reimbursed!	0
This IPhone that I buy there is less than a week frankly I expected better! Apparently it's a new device but now I have doubts, I have not worked for Apple or salesman in an Apple store but I know recognize a new iPhone! The battery of a new iPhone that behaves as if the phone has been repackaged! Antennas that show signs of friction! And the phone that heats up as not possible ah no! A star considering the work that has been done on the laptop to make it new!	0
iPhone 6s plus nine, but unfortunately there is something that moves in when I use the vibrator	0
This Iphone is sold at the same price (879 €) on the Apple website and not 1079 € (indicated by Amazon as recommended retail price by the manufacturer). Process denoting incompetence or dishonesty.	0
Article arrived late, the system is working properly, but the mobile is struggling to put the problem in the socket, the cord provided with does not work and the screen is scratched ... I'm not happy with my purchase go your way	0
The shipment was moderately protected. the phone only lasted a week. protected with a tempered glass and a shell, the touch has no longer responded with zebra for the end no longer light up	0
Bought new from Amazon, my iPhone 6S Plus has died for no reason after a dozen days - impossible to restart it, more load possible, black screen and no restart possible. Apple did not know what to offer except to send the phone for repair (75km from home, so 150 round trip), so I sent it back to Amazon. Now I'm waiting for the refund from Amazon, which takes 10 days worked (so for them, 15 days) from the date of receipt of the package. For 499 euros, it's a somewhat disappointing experience, even painful, I do not know if there was a better way to find a new phone, now I'm without phone> _ <. The few 10 days during which j I was able to enjoy the phone, it seemed very well designed, perfect ergonomics, impression of power very correct for my use, its only defect compared to current phones is in my opinion at the level of sound (mono, a little too much in the treble, not very nice to listen to music or watch a movie). I only made a few pictures, but they looked good, clearly above the old iPhone. To put in perspective for the most advanced users because I am not a "" power user "" (no games, no gourmet apps, no 4K video), I did not notice any particular weakness. it is a phone that is not at the forefront of technology, but is very nice to use for those who do not want to complicate life, like a Mercedes automatic that would have 100 or 200,000 km. The price (nine) is in my opinion too high for the technology.	0
I state that Amazon is and will remain synonymous with guarantee for me even after this experience. Unfortunately I find myself making this negative review for the following reasons: I purchased an iphone Xs 256 GB gray sidereal about 10 days ago. The smartphone will arrive on the day and without even turning it on, I apply a previously purchased protection film. I configure the phone restoring my backup and migrating all the main applications, losing half a day. The day after the purchase, handling the phone, I notice a kind of bulge / draft in the upper right part of the iphone. I call support, explaining what I found and promptly sent me a new phone (I love Amazon for this). I put the phone back in its packaging and after a few days of waiting I get the new phone. Same scheme: as soon as I open I apply a New film ( repurchased) to the new smartphone. I put more than half a day to reconfigure everything and reset the first smartphone to make the return. After doing everything, convinced to be okay, I look at the phone and I realize that the new one has the same defect (see photo). from a smartphone costing more than 1200 euros you expect perfection, and instead ... I decided to keep it anyway, because I can't lose other days between backup / restore and mail waiting for the return. However I feel very dissatisfied and above all disappointed for Amazon and Apple (I wonder where is the quality control?) I take this opportunity to ask a question to those who maybe know more than me: but can such a defect affect the physical characteristics? (impact resistance).	0
I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND	0
The iPhone is the iPhone. There are those who love him and those who hate him. I love it. Unfortunately, however, this specimen arrived with a sign + a scratch on the display (see photo). I do not think it is the seller's fault because the phone was perfectly packed so maybe it came this way.	0
Purchased "Used" - As new - The item is in its original packaging, but the packaging is damaged. "", When it arrived the product actually looked like new, without the slightest scratch, fluid software and undamaged battery. that the Face ID worked, pity though that browsing in the various features I found that the Animoji function did not work, oh well I could also fly over because I find it not very useful, BUT the most serious problem is the malfunction of the "portrait" mode of the iPhone , initially with the rear camera I hadn't noticed, thinking it was me who hadn't set something, but as soon as I switched to the front camera, the image became fuzzy (as shown in the image attached to the review). Contact Apple immediately, the which, following a diagnosis, detects a malfunction in the TrueDepth camera (then Animoji and mode "" portrait ""). I will return the A-device as soon as possible mazon.	0
I didn't expect such a thing from the warehouse. In addition to having arrived without a battery cable or headphones or anything already inside the box he spoke alone and once opened looked impaled. Moreover, without even pulling him out of the case he had a defect on the screen .... it took me nothing to decide to return it. It was cheap ...	0

Received as a gift 20 days ago. 10 years I have Apple phones. Extraordinary (even if it's not worth € 1200) until, from nothing, I touch it on the bedside table and feel it boiling. It is off and does not turn on. The phone was not charging and I had used the hotspot up to 10 minutes earlier. I try to cool it, even with water (I know it's waterproof), but it continues to heat up. Nothing, it has never turned on again. Official Apple "impeccable" assistance: they will receive me BETWEEN ONE WEEK. I am disappointed for the umpteenth time by a company that, since Steve is gone, guesses one every five.	0
Purchased in February, after 3 months of use it goes to block, and I am forced to use headphones because the audio volume is non-existent. I withdraw for replacement denied. Maximum disappointment, insufficient product.	0

I write this review to show the photos of the display of my Iphone XR just arrived, box closed, all new with film and everything, as soon as I opened I tried to turn on the phone and nothing, I thought it was flat the battery, but it wasn't like that, I made a forced start in CFU mode and after a few minutes you are logged in (which I didn't like) I started to notice this black spot on the lower right, but I thought it was something of the settings, I configured everything and this spot always visible , I searched the forums and saw that it's a flaw. I'm sorry because I'll have to stay without a cell phone another week :(	0
Product arrived Thursday 6 June. Just turned on, after 1 second it turns off and it doesn't turn on anymore, through assistance service first Amazon and then Apple I bring the phone in assistance, it results defective. Activation date of the phone is January 13 instead of June 6, I lost two days almost to figure out how to solve the problem, shipping was fast but unfortunately the KO phone. I needed the phone with some urgency, I was screwed. If the ignition problem had not happened to me and I would have used the phone regularly I would not have known about the date of its "first ignition", I would have lost 6 months of warranty on the mobile as well as I would not even have been able to do the application. The helpful and kind Amazon assistants. Now I made the return. Absolute disappointment and loss of time.	0
The strengths for this smartphone are certainly the battery life, camera and processor. For the rest .. it is disappointing .. Very excessive weight, notch and frame from ugly back .. Not to mention the price ... really exaggerated! For up to the Chinese brands always used to copy the iPhone have found alternative solutions decidedly more suited to the current needs ...	0
The other person did not feel well during calls and the speakerphone did not work.	0
I come from iPhone 8 Plus. Audio sometimes crackles, some lag still exists. FACE ID comfortable but not 100% accurate. The only good thing is the smartphone size despite being a 5.8 inch. / 18I don't know if it is a bug ios but audio in capsule is not heard but only in hands-free mode (rarely happens), after turning it off everything returns to normal. Other times you go to open the call and you can't do it because it seems blocked, after pressing the volume key it accepts the call. I'm trying to solve with apple assistance but if they don't solve I will have to make a return (very disappointed by this phone) Update 05/06/19 Although I updated and formatted the phone as advised by Apple today all the problems found in several blocks have returned. Combio phone and operating system	0

I state that my review is based on the product and not on the seller. I bought this new iPhone, because I wanted something more, something new and different ... instead I found myself holding an iphone 7 plus, a little smaller ... with a camera that was the same but positioned differently and a horrible cleat (notch) in front of the display that basically turns everything you watch on the screen ugly. Non-expandable memory, no fast recharging and even IP68 certification to withstand water and dust, not to mention the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to transfer photos and other media to the PC, everything is slow and cumbersome and iTunes is really a slow and heavy program. Practically an old iPhone for a big change, which has only the price of change, twice the price of a normal iPhone, an absurd price and totally unjustified for what this phone really offers! Equal in all respects to the old models. To say that I am disappointed is an understatement ... I do not recommend the purchase, if you are looking for the wow effect, move on to the competition, which here is only the salty price.	0
Ios won't let you do almost anything. He decides for you but this was already known. Poor reception, excellent battery and face id. In conclusion good phone if it cost about € 600.00	0
Arrived very quickly. Purchased and placed directly in custody bought together more tempered glass. It works perfectly. A few days later I remove it from my case to look at it a little bit and I notice that the glass is wobbling. I go to an Apple Store to show it and they offer me free glass replacement. I do not agree to have spent so much on a cell phone already to be repaired. I return it with great disappointment. I was unlucky	0
The seller declares that the product is Italian I had already, as soon as I bought it, raised the problem I was told that it was absolutely for the Italian market. In reality it is not so! I will go through the legal channels	0
Seller ostio, does not respond satisfactorily to requests for returns, I feel really taken for a ride after I was sold an extra limited iPhone (not specified in the description) as per invoice, after 5/6 months of controversy no one can give me the right support. I spent 850 euros for a phone that is worth up to 200 euros. indecent seller, complaint already made.	0
Given that I am very satisfied with the purchase, I rate the article with only two stars due to the unfortunate choice of Apple to exclude the audio output with mini jack and to allow the use of the earphones only with a Lightning connector (the same as you use to recharge your mobile phone). With these earphones you can no longer easily switch from the iPhone to your computer (which uses mini jack outputs), you will no longer be able to connect to the traditional audio output of seats on trains and airplanes, or even on the ergometer monitor of your gym. You won't even be able to use your favorite headphones to listen to your music because they won't enter the lightning output. There is yet another adapter that will drag all the drawbacks of the case: you lose it, you forget it, when you need it you don't find it, and I read reviews of some models that do not allow listening to phone calls but only music ... so you are more confident if you buy the original Apple adapter, as always, very expensive. Really an unpleasant choice from Apple.	0
So, let's start from the fact that last week I ordered another iphone from the Amazon Warehouse and still a week after the order had to leave (with Amazone Prime). Then finally I ordered this phone that when I accessed it was stuck on an iPhone cloud ..... What to say, an experience to forget .....	0
It would be perfect but the camera didn't work. Repaid in full	0
Bad seller I had to go elsewhere to replace the phone, thanks to my knowledge I solved with the replacement, the seller does not even deserve a star, plus the product has only one year warranty. Amazon has nothing to do with anything.	0

Product I will return ineligible and Amazon will not refund the money	0
not even a month that the battery already takes me less than an hour	0
I bought this iPhone in the hope of having made a great purchase, instead I immediately discovered that it wasn't the usual iPhone that gives you that Apple quality. I've always bought iPhones and it's the first time I've had to give back a piece like that. The basic problem was the battery life, it didn't last more than 4 hours. In addition to an abnormal heating of the device. Really disappointed.	0
The phone has arrived, everything is perfect, but the box and the instructions are in Russian. This makes me think that it is not the Italian version but the Russian version, while I wanted the Italian version.	0
but these are original or fake because there are people who have used broken iphone.	0
Buy for brand change I was really disappointed the warranty is not Italian and then it does not work very well The audio croaks and the touch is not very intuitive disappointed.	0
600 euros thrown away !!!!! The product did not satisfy me and I sent it back. The seller gave me an address but, once printed, the label was incomplete. it was therefore not possible to deliver the package which was then lost. After 2 months of complaints and discussions, I resigned myself to have lost 600 euros and I recommend it. I strongly advise that the seller is easy to anger and tried to ask me for extra money to collect the package in person.	0
I think it is unacceptable to pay a similar price and find yourself a scratched product even before using a new item. Quality control equal to zero.And the most absurd thing is that it is not the first time that strange / heavy inconveniences happen to me, unfortunately lately the quality level of the products on this e-commerce has dropped by a lot. The choice of certain couriers then it accentuates the deterioration, in fact I gave up and abandoned even my Prime subscription, in addition to buying much less since then you are necessarily obliged to return, finding yourself being called back, unjustly. I hope, for all of us, to be just randomness and not other.	0
After several months of use I am increasingly puzzled as to how such phones can have such a high price. Embarrassing limitations, hardware back years, bad structural quality .. There is no comparison with competitors who offer cutting-edge technologies at a much lower price. I strongly recommend the purchase of these overestimated devices with a clearly disadvantageous price / quality ratio.	0
I purchased this iPhone on June 21st, on June 25th I point out to the seller that the shipment is stopped. I urge Nexive not to deliver the iPhone but a few days later it reports the shipment as delivered. Absolute panic forwarding complaint to Amazon. Delivery rescheduled for July 2nd ever. Item never received got refund after 7 days. Amazon has certainly repaid but it is absurd that it allows certain sellers to use its platform. Bad behavior from everyone bad experience. Maybe I was unlucky but the other reviews are all real? I strongly doubt. Amazon gets worse with the passing of months. I will always be unlucky but I buy almost nothing.	0
Attention before buying it is not an Italian brand but European unfortunately the seller should tell her these things ....... I noticed by opening the box came out the plug with the American socket ... then the rest is ok phone arrived a day before shipping as established on Amazon	0
Beyond the not so modest price, it is certainly one of the best smartphones on the market ... too bad that it has only one flaw: PESA TOO!	0
I am very disappointed that I would never have expected such a big flaw from such a costly and high quality product! apart from the aesthetic problem there is also the functional one, the phone should be resistant to splashes but I have my doubts about the waterproofing in that point since there is a nice crack, besides it fills up a lot of dust because the thin frame of plastic between glass and body is protruding, and retains dust.	0
A long list of inexplicable malfunctions, so much so that I suspected it to be a chinoiserie with a fake Apple logo. I don't know any owner of Iphone that is dissatisfied like me, besides I have owned for years 2 Mac Book, 1 other Iphone for children and an Ipad Air 2, but nothing works so badly. I have not yet brought him in assistance because I have to get a replacement; I saved a little compared to direct purchase from Apple, but never from retailers that are not more than safe. Based on the response of the authorized assistance, I will evaluate a return with refund.	0
Received a few days ago. I'm learning to use it anyway, the battery runs out quickly even with minimum brightness. It's hard to hold because it's big. (The size of the display is not the one indicated by amazon.) I give you a tip: PLAY ON IPHONE X- XR- XS. AVOID IPHONE 7, 7 PLUS, 8, 8 PLUS.	0
I bought Iphone 8 plus on June 25th before they wrote negative reviews, the package was not even sent (contacted Nexive courier) Contact Amazon who immediately replies for a refund! the operators will reassure you, repaid immediately with the credit card, it will take qlc day but send a refund confirmation email. they may have suffered a theft of accounts not purchased for the moment!	0
without making unnecessary controversy the seller refused the reimbursement request saying that it was out of time (I don't think I bought it on 19 July) and that the phone had been registered in my name: but to verify the correct functioning of the product it must be activated and I found some problems with the software but since I was in warranty I turned to an apple center in the area where I live that very kindly fix it after this adventure I will not buy anything on amazon	0
After 1 year and little more than the order, the phone suddenly shows no signs of life. Contact the seller being still within the warranty time (2 years from law) impossible to contact the seller (euroglobal). I do not recommend ...	0
I had a problem with the phone and no one just spun off the barrel the seller never gave an answer .. although I still had the guarantee .. never again !!!!!!	0
After a year and a half of use, the iPhone presented a fault which was found to be the result of a manufacturing defect. Although the seller's guarantee provided for them to be collected, checked by Apple and repaired, I was not able to obtain this withdrawal and therefore the defect remains our responsibility. Do not make expensive purchases online to save a few euros, you risk losing a lot more than if you had bought it in the store, like us.	0
Delivery was timely. First disappointment: the accessories. The cable and the socket are there, but they do not work well, there are no aricles. Positive note: a protection has been added to the screen. The phone is not externally in very good condition as it was written in the description. Whoever owned it before me must never have used a cover because the phone has a dent in every corner. As far as the operation is concerned, the phone goes very well, I see no difference between the new and the reconditioned. The battery seems to me Discrete.	0
After finding problems related to the operation of the iPhone 7 sound card, being still under legal warranty (2 years), I tried to contact the Globalphone S.R.L.S. seller requesting the repair, replacement or return of the product. In addition to never having replied to me, the seller has never acknowledged either the amazon operators or the consumer protection association. I therefore find myself with a non-working mobile phone, as useful as a broomstick I would love to use on those of Globalphone.	0
SELLER LOST IN ANYTHING. After a year the phone is no longer going. Legally I am entitled to a 24 month warranty ... but Digital Kingdom has disappeared into thin air. Untraceable. I strongly advise against it	0
The essential thing to know is that the seller has become foggy, does not respond to complaints, the phone stopped working in March, the warranty ends in June 2019 and it is from March 2019 that I try to assert my rights without getting answer.	0
DO NOT give warranty .... are unavailable by email and by phone DO NOT BUY before buying try to call the number you find indicated !!	0
iPhone with defect in the audio recording of the movies .. background noise impressed! Substitute 2 times without solving the problem! Ruined my wife's birthday! Thank you!	0
I PURCHASED THIS PHONE ONE YEAR AND TWO MONTHS FA.ORA PHONE FAILURE! I AM ADDRESSED IN AN APPLE STORE AND I HAVE NOTIFIED THAT THE CELL IS DEFECTIVE AND IT DOESN'T TURN ON. NO ONE REFUNDED ME 1 CENTURY BECAUSE NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE AFTER THE 30 DAYS FROM THE PURCHASE. WHAT A SCHIFO.	0
order placed on August 31st, and today September 13th I have received nothing yet. Contact the seller and tell me to wait. I hope to get back to you as soon as possible. I highly recommend another seller.	0
Ordered the item on June 23rd, delivery scheduled between June 27th and 29th. Then the delivery date was moved between July 2nd and 4th. I accepted because I needed the item for a fafre gift on July 10th .It is the evening of July 10th and still nothing .... I canceled the order! It is the first time that the Amazon service disappoints me.	0
NEVER BUY THIS PHONE! Mine was stolen and I'm really pissed !!! I try to contact them but they don't come alive !!	0
I have just ended the call with the amazon call center caller. Despite the long phone call the damage was not completely repaired. Today, on 10.7.- well beyond the maximum delivery date set by the first - I received the package ordered. The amazon packaging appeared to be intact, while once the package was opened, the iPhone box was cellophane-free and empty inside. The cellular device was missing, the cables and everything else boasted in the description of the product. The package is - or maybe I should say ERA - sold and shipped by amazon. As written, I immediately called the call center, which told me that there was no ready and equivalent substitute. The package contained a gift for a degree, to be celebrated on Thursday. Currently the situation in which it is paid is the following: - inability to place a new order for the equivalent product without added costs - inability to order a substitute to the product without further disbursements - damage from delay in delivery - damage from non-gift (as Thursday I will have to present myself at the unloaded degree of this). I thank Amazon for the unpleasant inconvenience to which it has not been able to give prompt repair and solution. You have certainly lost a customer. The justification "to err is human" is not, at present, sufficient. I strongly believe that I am the victim of a scam. By reserving the right to proceed, it is not advisable to order this product. I am still waiting for the supervisor's call.	0
I bought the phone, but after a couple of weeks it started to have problems with heating and wifi. On October 3, I submitted the return request, but the seller REFUSED because according to him on August 30th the 30-day period for the restitution.While in reality 27 have passed since the actual delivery as shown in the photo.Among the other Amazon, since he is not the direct seller, he is accepting his position. I made a further complaint and I am waiting for an answer ... but bad at the moment .. Something in Amazon is changing attention.	0
Exceptional shipping, ordered on April 27th and arrived on April 28th, too bad it was a defective product (non-working microphone, also recognized by Apple, which made a replacement)	0
Write Italy but in reality it is a guarantee for Europe. In addition, the phone came with a folded box. I do not recommend. Around there are lower prices with Europe guarantee.	0
Price too high for a smart with very low performance .... in full apple style	0
Iphone ordered the 6, sent according to the seller on 8 but we are at 15 and still I have not received anything ... and it is a gift ... I tried to contact the seller several times but he doesn't answer and also through amazon I solicited to have at least a traking number ... I will wait until tomorrow and then I will start the refund procedure ... absolutely unreliable.	0
I had a phone that did not work right away and with the right of termination as by law I am still fighting to have it withdrawn and have the amount refunded and I know I will have to pass the case to the lawyer.	0
I was not satisfied I had ordered the phone for my daughter had to be the Christmas gift and it was lost ... the refund was made immediately for that they were fast	0
This phone only works well the first month then it starts to freeze and after a year you have to change it I don't recommend it	0
I had ordered a 32gb iphone 7 for Christmas and after days that told me that it was shipped from the same day I received an email from amazon with the written that they will repay me all the money and they told me that the product was not never been sent	0
Just arrived the phone seemed to work until I tried to make a call. The problem was the earpiece which had a very low volume (although I had turned up the volume to the maximum) and also it didn't work in stereo mode for videos (something that distinguishes the iPhone 7 from an iPhone 6s). Request a refund.	0
After just 2 years it doesn't work anymore	0
Unfortunately, despite the phone arrived on time and in excellent condition, including original packaging, after 3 days of use it had problems with the ignition, so that I had to bring it to fix. My low rating is due to this experience which I hope for the seller and for other users is an isolated fact	0
Item returned as it presented dust between the camera sensor and the light green of protection ... from an ip67 certified phone (resistant to water and dust) it was not the case to keep it. Impeccable Amazon after-sales service and repayment in a very short time	0
My review is addressed to the third seller MIPHONE. I bought an iPhone 7 for € 630. I then requested the return because I received a double gift. Returned the goods back with paccocelere 3. The seller received the goods on 11-5-17 (checked through the post office website). To date 17-05-17 I have not seen a penny back. I contacted MIPHONE, who replies once every 3 messages and is therefore very absent, and they wrote to me "at the moment we cannot handle us. The return will be amazon which will do so" ". Absolutely false, I contacted the Amazon customer service who opened a complaint to me saying that the thing is false and if he received the goods he must also proceed with the refund. Draw your conclusions about the seller. I will update the review based on the outcome of the complaint. Update: the AZ buyer protection program returned my money. 5 stars at amazon and 1 at the seller who, evidently, was banished from amazon	0
At first he sent an email to change shipping methods, they were very friendly, they answered fast, very kind, they made an excellent impression. The iPhone has arrived, and it has a lot of problems with audio, I sent an email to a damaged iPhone and they didn't deign to answer. Zero seriousness.	0
Why is it that in my review of this product in the option to continue reading does not let me enter the whole view but only partial, maybe I wrote something that is not good for you to show it to users?	0
After three days of use, the phone vibrated continuously even when switched off. Scratch speaker volume output with low volume microphone. They tell me that they don't understand anything in the call. In conclusion: one who spends about 800 euros on a phone should at least expect the top, not a totally poor product. Amazon as always impeccable in refund with refund.	0
After buying the new apple smartphone from Apple and after months of use (having had all the iphone models) I can express an opinion. Starting from the packaging you immediately notice the savings, unlike the 6s box, in particular the headphone box that this time it is in very bad cartoncino.Fino to arrive to the use proper of the cell, equal to the previous model if not worsened above all to aesthetic level. The design is the same as that of a last-generation ipod (almost anonymous). Compared to the 6s, it no longer has the physical home button but has been replaced by a fake one that does not at all give the idea of ​​pressing a button, and also lacks the headphone jack and you need to add an adapter (fortunately supplied). It is no longer possible to listen to music if the cell is charging for this reason (unless you spend 170 euros for some awful bluetooth headphones). Also I noticed that starting from 6 it is now full of lag (something that the iphone have never had at least until 5s). Fortunately, many corrections arrive thanks to the frequent updates of ios. The only positive note is that it is now water resistant but as usual apple does not cover the damages caused by the immersion of the cell in the latter, so I will not try absolutely at do it or imagine it! The speed compared to that of the 6s is practically identical in my opinion, as for the quality of the camera. Fluid only in games. I would have expected a real change and I think that for this we have to wait for a long time, at least until the iPhone 8 comes out, since the 7s will be the usual heated soup. So in conclusion neither is it worth it to go from 6s (64gb) at 7 (32gb)? DEFINITELY NO! By now the competition is offering much better products at a lower price. This iphone is fortunate to always be a fashionable item but in the long run if apple won't be woken up I don't think I'll buy it anymore!	0
I went from 6 to 7. Mah! Absolutely worse! Better the 6! In my use for work I do not see any significant improvement in the functions in terms of speed than in otherMA, ESPECIALLY, THE BATTERY LASTS 20% less!. AND THIS IS THE MOST SERIOUS!	0
Refurbished telephone ruined crystal shell chipped the only good delivery time	0
Received an empty package, inside the phone was not present if not card ... demanded reimbursement but not obtained from him, scammer	0
I don't know why but I was constantly losing the data connection. I tried to change another manager's card but it was the same thing. It would have been a case, I don't know, but I proceeded with the return and I took another.	0
Now iPhone loses and this 7 plus is the confirmation. At 200-300 € there are android terminals that allow the user to do many more things, they are more versatile and above all they have an o.s. which has much less bugs than iOS (which carries the same problems from the 7.0 to the present day, absurd). If you have money to waste and you are iPhone fanatics then there is, but otherwise look elsewhere, your wallet will be happy .	0
Unfortunately the product of my order does not correspond to the product ordered. Instead of receiving an iPhone 6S 32GB I got an old iPhone 6 32GB.	0
I waited a week for the iPhone to arrive and I immediately had to send it back because it didn't load. I would have expected amazon to better control the used products as the description says that the product is working properly	0
Purchased less than a month ago, after I could not recharge the phone due to force majeure, this was obviously off due to low battery. Connected to the cable the following day, battery does not give signs of life, it does not charge, and even with the combined buttons you can start the phone. Update: after a month the phone has not been repaired because I have to disable a function. I am informed that I will be returned and then once I reset I will have to send it back for repair. after a few days they insist on replacing the mobile phone or making me a refund, despite insisting that I have work data inside and I have to recover it. I would like to know where the phone is? Amazon disappointment.	0
I bought this phone and the battery stayed at 17% even if I put it in charge for hours. This defect was unpleasant, I requested a refund immediately.	0
The only positive thing about customer service, I took this phone for a gift but it didn't even turn on. Immediately sent back!	0
had audio problems and programs installed. I made it.	0
Poor product	0
Purchased iPhone 6s 16gb and received free upgrade of 32gb version. Thank you for the Christmas gift, the phone stopped working after only 10 days. Contacted Apple support currently the phone is a replacement. However it was pointed out to me that the attached receipt does not contain sufficient elements to guarantee proof of purchase. So being the first year the product is still under Apple's warranty and then goodbye. I tried to write to the seller to request an invoice but nothing ...	0
They made fun of me for 3 weeks telling me that it had been sent, instead of admitting that they no longer had devices available, they suck, seriousness 0, too bad that you can't give 0 stars!	0
Guys but is it new I reconditioned?	0

Sir / Madam, I am very surprised that the iPhone I bought from you lately doesn't work very well. every time I use it, it often gets hot. what you can do about it	0
As you can see from what is written in this same product page, the manufacturer of the object is "" Novae Plus "" and not "" Apple ""! beware of imitations!	0

I actually had almost everything from Apple, ... iPad, iPad Pro, Macbook Air, now MacBook Pro, Apple Watch 2, iPhone 4,5,6,6s, now 7 and was always thrilled with the reliability and quality .But with this iPhone XS 256GB I'm out. This super mega-sharp Oled display can not be true white and black. It has a strong yellowish tinge that is unacceptable to me. Of course I have turned off True Tone and all that and even worked only in the shades of gray over the color filter = yellow! .All of my photos I made in SW with my Canon 5D mark4 have elaborately edited in Photoshop, are now yellowish. The SW effect of these images is now totally meaningless. Likewise, I find the reading on my iPhone 7 easier than the XS, since the contrast is clearer. Of course, I realize that the resolution of the OLED display is much higher, but this difference takes the human eye was not more.This not yet mature 1249 ¬ mobile phone I send back and I will buy the iPhone 8 mitguter old quality.	0
Well, I'll try to make it short. I owned the following iPhones: 3GS, 4S, 6, 6s, 7 plus and this one here, which will be the end of the journey in the Apple Cosmos. Incidentally, I use an iPad and a MacBook Pro. I do not want to go into the technical specs, which is easier to read on technical pages. For me, it's about the shortcomings of this rigid and now completely unthinkable operating system. What used to be advanced is now dusty and regressive. Some details: Siri, totally useless - "Siri navigate me home" Siri: "here is home address: street name" She does not provide the simplest things Shortcuts, the new Apple app as an automator replacement for the iOS is just laughable. 4 useful shortcuts are available, everything else is not possible due to the restrictions. The settings are now scattered completely confused: automatic brightness of the screen is not found in the screen control / brightness, but under a submenu 30 kilometers away, because of Apple is intuitive. Nevertheless, iTunes is the basis for synchronistation on the mac and on the pc, the old Romans have already used it, and even they were already annoyed by it.Landscape mode does not work well and takes a lot on most apps unnecessarily Place away - completely embarrassing support of the top models. (Not xs related) Hand off (model overarching work) works completely unreliable, sometimes not for weeks, then again. Any individualization of the operating system is impossible. Turn off wifi does not mean: wifi off. Price is now unacceptable, even if the value stability Well, I could go on forever ... and that's why it will probably in the future, which is still far, a leak out of the entire Apple cosmos mean. Certain things are just too much of a good thing. Can others do better? Let's see .. but the most basic things you should already be able to trust the almost most valuable company in the world at this time - but this seems clearly too much to ask.	0
For a week now I am the owner of the iPhone Xs. Unfortunately, I'm not at all convinced of what I get for my money. Because after almost every charging process, the battery capacity drops by 1 percent. After the 5th charging process, I'm already at 97 percent maximum capacity and the runtime itself is not convincing me either. The display is also causing problems. It has an extreme yellow tinge. With this problem brings me so great Super Retina Display nothing	0
CHEATER !!! Get cheap cell phone see photo ....	0
Info: bought in the media market in friedrichshafen / bodensee2 weeks of intensive useApple disappointed from year to year more.Display: I loved the true tone function in my i phone 8, in the XS, however, much too warm and yellowish! Even with display calibration can not even set in the beginning so that it has just as a nice display as my 8 -er. In Media Markt, where I bought my XS, I compared it to other XS and X models. All the same problem. When activated by True Tone yellowish. My 8-er, as I said, is natural and not yellowish at True Tone. Incidentally, the 7, 8 and even the new i phone xr model which all have a lcd and not this new oil panel as the x, and xs models, all have not the problem with yellowish displays. Apparently I am so highly praised oled technology to lie, because although they have a perfect black value, but in contrast to Apple's lcd panels have no perfect whiteness in (self-search on the Internet) Sound: wow !!! Very audible improvement for comparison with the 8-er. Note 1 They sound full, and have good bass in the meantime iOS operating system: in itself good performance, nothing jerks running apple typically fluid, update policy more than top !! If not meanwhile these many bugs since Ios 11 einschleicjen! Apple you must those prices that you demand, will be much better again! Battery life: very clear opinion - no! In a € 1350 expensive "toy" me to deliver a battery life, at a much larger battery than the built in my i phone 8, then brings a soooo short battery life with it! No! My 8-er yes the small mind you and not the 8plus model, had in my very intensive use a battery life of 1-1 one-and-a-half days. The 1350 ¬ expensive XS model with significantly larger battery already had in the early days already so 25-28% !! Grade 6 Conclusion: I have it unfortunately to an almost 500 ¬ loss at rebuy buy and I will buy in spring / March 2019 a i phone XR, which (even convinced in the media market) win beautiful lcd panel with natural-looking colors, no yellowing gets when reue rone is activated, and in contrast to the XS model is not only much cheaper but also loud tests, you can also read the internet, has a much longer battery life than the XS models, even better than the xS ma x model and the X model from the previous year! Thank you for your time of reading, it is honest words of a normal working man, neither a so-called apple moch android "younger"	0
After the drama with the iPhone X and their display problem, I wanted to give the newer version again a chance. To put it briefly, better take an older model which also works. Apps are mostly not optimized for the screen. iPhone crashes again and again. In the middle of phoning for example. Face ID did not work after the 2nd week, not a new configuration was not possible, more possible because the iPhone did not even recognize the face. Furthermore, the keyboard was displayed in the home screen although no input was required. Calls were superimposed on the home screen. Taking off was not possible. In these cases, only a deliberate restart of the iPhone helped. In this price category just a no-go. And I know iPhones since the 2nd generation (pictures will follow)	0
Never experienced such a jerky iPhone. Scrolling on text pages makes it no fun at all as it is almost constantly jerking and shaking. Who believes that would be an isolated incident, the Internet forums are full of complaints about this topic.	0
I switched from the X to the XS and was impressed by the performance and also by the camera, but I have less battery at the end of the day than with the iPhone X and am very frustrated because of that! Battery life possible to live long: location, background services, push etc. everything that helps disabled or reduced to the minimum. If I still want to use the cell in the evening lead the way on the charger is not over, that was different in the X, too bad! This is the first time I've resorted to an S upgrade and I would be very disappointed ... I've already thought about selling the XS and switching to an Xer ... but it probably boils down to me until the 11er iPhone downgrade the battery will accept	0
Contents of the pack and information on the package do not match! I paid extra to make sure that I did not buy the iPhone from a third party, but paid attention to "selling and shipping through Amazon". On the box was a completely different serial number to see, as in the device. I had bought the phone in gold, the serial number of the device showed after checking the Internet on a silver model. The device was also already in use, when I turned it on nothing had to be set up and it was directly the home screen with apps to see. Even after reset to factory settings (in the process was funny to see the Android icon) I could not log in as usual from Apple step by step. I have sent it back right now. Stay away from this device and buy directly from Apple.	0
I have purchased the product from Amazon.de. Delivery was fast and faultless as used by Amazon. The device set up as a new device, for the first time I was positive überarscht, but then came the evil Überarschung the Iphone is simply a restart had erwuzingen with loud + quiet button and then power button, then it is a while then the same problem again the status bar disappears repeatedly and when I call often I have failed call Apple contacted I should reset the device. Said done no improvement. Have now taken contact with Amazon let's see how it will continue now. For the price the problems should not be present. Update 23.1.19 Today Amazon received a replacement device as always Top shipping and lightning fast. When I unpacked the phone, I've made a nasty surprise the phone has a quirk below or is broken off the top and on the side also add the pictures to Amazon contacted and again ordered replacement hopefully the smooth.	0
After I had decided to spend 1220 EUR for an iPhone XS Silver, I was looking forward to the new device. Recently, I had an iPhone SE. The device makes a good visual impression, but turned out quickly that the joy will be short lived. Because the device was delivered from the factory with a broken volume knob. So if I'm currently unintentionally adjusting the volume for music or calls, there's no way to fix it. Apple has suggested sending the device and sending it back in 10 days. They would even pick it up. Alternatively, I'm allowed one day to go from Apple's election to a store and talk to a technician there. However, only at 10 o'clock in the morning. Sure, "who else is working if he can buy an iPhone for 1220", is probably the logic. I'm terribly disappointed with Apple. Only good that I ordered from Amazon: get in 2 days a replacement device and then only have to move everything again, but always have a device available.	0
For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Use only if the phone with the display is up on the table Warranty / Guarantee: The iPhone XS is indeed high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Apple gives on its products generally only 12 months Manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the price policy actually almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone from the top My rating of one star refers exclusively to the criticisms mentioned above.Note: Factual comments I am willing to answer, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and not with criticism to be able to deal with! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.	0
Premium Price - Premium Product? Unfortunately no.My new iPhone XS 256GB, freshly unpacked, charges the battery only sporadically. The Lightning connection often has to be put in and out several times, it's just a matter of luck. Overnight, the battery was e.g. only about half charged and then the battery charge was interrupted with the Lightning charger plugged in. With another out and reinstecken it went on. For a smartphone beyond the 1000 € an imposition. I was with the device at the Apple dealer site, there the problem was also recognized. On-site software updates were performed, smartphone reset, restarted - nothing helps. It was offered to send the 2-day-old iPhone for repair - I refused and made use of the right of withdrawal. After a short googling that does not seem to be an isolated case.	0
For over 1000 € so bad displays. I bought two Xs. One is good and the second has clear reddish up and to the right. This is very bad for so much money. Exchange is not my thing. Right side has a gap between the display and the case, which you can not only see, but the edge is therefore also sharp. The device is fast, fluid and good, but so poor final inspection for so much money ... No, I'm not satisfied! Only one star because of much too high price and bad final control. Today I have noticed that the power button can only print above and below it totally jammed. One device and three quirks.	0
iPhone stepped back in technological evolution with removal of Touch ID. The alternative we have been provided with, Face ID, is less secure and more temperamental. Especially, when you are not in an ideal situation facing it.There are plenty of occasions when one needs to unlock ones phones without having to face it....Fail....	0
Apple advertises the iPhone XS with an IP68 certification. But does not guarantee it. This is fraud in my eyes!	0
Hello people:) I think it's really good that you here so much reinschreiben:) I had considered to buy either the IPhone XR, IPhone XS or the iPhone XS Max .. I have until now the iPhone 8Plus! What is really great :), but I would rather another .. the newer, the better:) I have now read a lot of "bad" about the iPhone XR & I think, then I'll love the iPhone XS Max, IPhone XS I think that's out of the question, because the processing should not be so good and because it's smaller than my iphone 8Plus. And I love big phones! What would you recommend? Which of the 3's? Please only give some tips that have the respective IPhones :) that would help me the most !! I would buy the iPhone and not here in Germany, but in Switzerland:) To a lot of cheaper, of course, connects one then with a holiday :) or rather the other way round: Please ask for tips. (Ratings are not correct, because I have to enter something to write here)	0
It is a joke what Apple now calls for the iPhone! Not without reason, the sales go back significantly and I agree with the full! One think: There used to be the iPhone 8 and 8Plus for about 700 and 800 euros then came the X where many thought wooow a completely new premium iPhone for an extremely high premium price .... I bought it and must also say that I am completely disappointed with the processing ... I am an iPhone user of quasi first hour but that with a 1150 euro expensive smartphone on the back one side is sharp-edged than the other side (if one of the glass on the frame touches noticeable) is a NO GO! And now it is so the Apple again brings a Preiskracher and that XR the "cheap version" for the price that used to cost the premium model and for the normal model XS offers for over 1100 euros and the hammer! The big one for about 1200! Earlier IPhone 8 = 700 Euro model comparison XS = 1150 Euro8Plus = 800eueo XSMAX = 1200 Euro. As Apple has now finally overstepped the arc and this revenges itself now also on the basis of the new sales figures and that is completely deserved! Price so outrageously expensive then this will be my last iPhone sein.Und I have already heard of many people ... All the best with your usury strategy which slowly no longer rises what by the way applies to other Apple products. The competition is now at least equivalent and much much cheaper. Until then and goodbye Apple!	0
OK, all in all. I had a Huawei P20 Pro in direct comparison and I have to say that Huawei makes much better photos especially the front camera. What I really want to criticize is the price is by no means worth justifying the device's regular lags, the camera is no better than the Huawei devices. Quick charger must be purchased seprat. AUX adapter is not included. I will sell this smartphone again and get the Huawei P20 Pro. Because of the audacity of Apple nothing to do for his customers and because of the better price-performance ratio. Conclusion after 4 weeks: Face ID does not recognize my face, face can not be reconfigured ... I'm glad if the part is gone .. ,	0
 Purchased version:  iPhone XS Max • 256 GB ~ Space Gray  Hello everybody, I also want to briefly and briefly because much has already been written in advance, say a lot to what has annoyed me as an Apple Fan Boy animal. I did not buy it because of the price here on Amazon. I was very pleased with the new iPhone XS MAX. Purchased, and intensively tested here is my result in a compressed version. I was stressed above all because of the camera and battery! Much of the negative experiences I can underline here. My first impression: looks like a grown iPhone X out. And for the many money, of course, very chic and beautiful. Very noble, very good workmanship! • UNBOXING: Despite high-end price of proud 1600 € lacks u.a. a part of the iPhone X was still on board - also: no quick charger and no Qi charging pad. Impudence! So Apple has abruptly abolished wired jack headphones completely. If you want to have the adapter, you can pay a hefty 10 euros when you buy it directly from Apple.Otherwise, there is the usual stuff: a Lightning cable and a power adapter and ear pods with a Lightning connector. • PERFORMANCE: Apple's highly acclaimed performance did not really blow me away. Overall: way too slow, maybe a bit faster than my iPhone X (40% faster) .Apps also do not open faster. There is no leap forward. As far as surfing is concerned, I'll save it, it'll be silly with Safari. People who can see a little bit worse could get in trouble with it. What I found very funny though, was that despite the huge display many apps that did not exploit. Of all this, I especially liked the huge OLED display. Really first cream.BUY: Keep still in mind that this device costs 1600 €. • OPERATION: The operation altogether was not a problem for me personally. For people with small hands and newbies here are some problems with the operation before programmed. The screen diagonal could be too good for some: With the one-handed operation, as already written, not all areas of the display can easily be reached. • CAMERA: As a hobby photographer, I love to capture pictures in nature and sometimes at night Unfortunately, here some people are not 100% happy, they are silky, they take it that way! Honestly not better than my iPhone X..Why? The pictures are very natural! No question, BUT: compared to the high-end product from a well-known manufacturer, what my colleague, his pictures are much better. Because just in the low-light more light on his sensor zulässt.Und the automatic often disappears and creates The VIDEO camera! Very nice and supple shots. One should still keep in mind that this smartphone costs 1600 €. • FRONT CAMERA: The front camera can Why: Even here are selfies of the competition compared to a top model from Appleum far better, both at night and during the day. • AKK UDisplayhelligkeit00 clock out of the house, on the go music heard- from 8 - 17 clock: 5 x approx. 5 min. Videotelephony - 5 videos of 30 min each viewed - almost 1 hr on YouTube - 4 games gambled - each about 10 phone calls from average 10 min carried out - WhatsApp = At ​​the end of the day at 20 o'clock I still had 18%. The competition is a little better and more economical: Here the competition had a battery value of 31% at the end of the day • SPEAKER: Are super, mega. Rich sound much better than my iPhone X. To be honest, I was very surprised. Also with the bass I was very surprised. POSITIVE: + Display + Speaker + (VIDEO) Camera + Top ProcessingNEWRAL- Disappointing delivery- Price = Sheikh class- no real performance boost- No jack adapter, - no faster charger- Some apps do not use the large display - Disappointing Battery Disappointing development • FAZI TFo 1600 € you should give at least for its loyal Apple customers more in the scope of delivery. But Apple thinks of course in this point what: Who Apple wants to pay Apple and accessories for the small money as well I also hoped that this iTunes will finally get away and come in a different way (more innovative) used. Nothing. It remains the constant connection on iTunes.For the money, the competition is much better in my eyes. Since Steve died, one of his very good iPhones died with him. For me it was .... Thank you for reading my review! Hope it was a help in the purchase decision! If so, I would be very happy about a helpful click.	0
Who buys a smartphone for 1600 €, has completely lost control of his life ...	0
Wondering if it's worth spending so much on an iPhone XS? No!!! I am an Apple user myself and have a MacBookPro and an iPhone. I still tolerated it on the MacBookPro, but not on the iPhone XS at all. It's already as expensive as the MacBook Air, which can do more ... processing or not ... the iPhone is a cell phone and has no 4GB of RAM / RAM. I think nothing of the internal memory, which can be up to 512GB. One does not use the mobile phone for 10 years, in order to use so much. No app eats up so much memory and you could not enjoy it either. I would rather wait until the iPhone is downgraded to a reasonable price that you can afford. If you want to buy a € 1,000 + cell phone, ask yourself what you want to do with it. If you just want an expensive cell phone that looks and is processed well, buy it. If you want to have a status icon that shows you can afford expensive things, the phone would be ideal. If you use a mobile phone to play, talk on the phone, chat and watch movies, you should wait at least 1 year or look for another phone. At a price of 800 € or max 900 €, I could understand it (I would always not yet worth it).	0
I have problems with the device but the dealer as well as Amazon does not care. Nobody cares. A device for 1400 € and after a month it is scrap for me.	0
Overpriced, Bad processor	0
Unfortunately, very disappointing	0
Got the first XS Max, it had a very strong Blueshifting. The second arrived, it had less, but a darker Display.Und in the first was also a Krazer in the Display.Das excited me animal if you consider it costs 1250 ¬! Simply unfair and sick on the new phone no joy to find ,	0
For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Use only if the phone with the display is up on the table Warranty / Guarantee: The iPhone XS is indeed high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass.

After iPhone 5,6,7plus I wanted to do something special and bought the XSmax. Although the reviews were mostly good, I would not buy this device anymore. I find it extremely complicated and causes problems with the eternal passwords. I entered my password incorrectly when setting up and Apple locked the device for 2 weeks. When it was unlocked after 2 weeks the ID was changed and I could not do anything again. Unfortunately, the return period has passed through the long blocking period and I do not know at the moment how it should go on. Therefore my rating with only 2 stars	0
Profit, feelings and the power of money. Very fine everything would be kept in balance. I have the iPhone from the beginning, I always liked the balance. Good product, good software, feel good about owning an iPhone. That's not the case anymore. Profit XXL, leadership mistakes, no vision, total digitization, misuse of customers with corresponding injuries. It all upsets the balance. What a pity.	0
A catastrophe .. never again .. from today to tomorrow defective .. No fall no garnicht .. At one time faceID does not know it .. Diagnosis board inside broken .. The last Apple product	0

I had already worried the XS and was shocked by the bad OLED display. That's why I got now the iPhone XR with old (new) Technik.TrueTone is off, brightness to 100%, Nightshift off. Again a yellow cast in the display as in the XS. The clarity has weakened a lot compared to the iPhone 7. Ergo Apple is now going the way of the best possible return at the expense of the Kunden.Ich Unfortunately, I can not understand how so many positive reviews about this Handyhier vorhanden.Natürlich I realize that this is the low-priced Version of the XS is, but here is then the better decision to buy an iPhone 7 or 8 ...... or to go to the competition, otherwise it will not understand Tim Cook with 13.7 million € salary.	0
Very bad display quality	0
I got the iPhone at the MediMarkt and I have to admit that it is the complete wrong buy true the graphics have deteriorated enormously and the software is extremely slow	0
Well, what can I say, I have a Sony Experia XZ Compact. I sat for almost two days now on the XR to transfer my data. It just can not be done even with this one Great transfer app, I get nothing from my Sony rueber.I will certainly not every single contact, apps ect. Manuel set up. Unfortunately it was an attempt that failed.	0
First of all to me iPhone 4, iPhone 6s- Usable features: One-hand mode by double tap, 3D touch, Touch ID, opening the camera via control center, power saving mode permanently on.- large hands- Most used apps: Snapchat, Whatsapp, Facebook , Instagram, various games, news appsPlus: ++ Design, case size, weight +++ operation + touch ID criticism at 6s: --- very low battery life (at least 2x load a day) (now 77% battery power, but power-saving mode always on + Stromfresser like Bluetooth and Wlan switched off on the way) - screen size too small- speed, resolution, camera not up-to-date (but personally I do not find sooo annoying) - soon no more updatesThese annoying problems have moved me to pick up a new model for some years now One day I had the iPhone XR in use and can say the following things (not purchased on Amazon) ++ Battery life top (very much use: games, Bluetooth and WLAN perma nent on, rumprobieren, etc.) and had 10h use still 40% + speed: the apps open much faster, and the display recognizes the inputs much faster. + Of course, the camera is better than my old 6s + color and optics (Back side): the matt aluminum frame and the darker black look very good. + I did not miss the 3D touch as the haptic touch covers 90% of the functions. But now on the negative aspects: first, the ones that bother me less: - Design (front): The Notch I personally do not like, if I hold the XR transversely to watch videos. The thick edge makes the iPhone appear a bit cheap in my opinion - I personally like the fingerprint sensor better than Face-ID, since you always have to raise the phone to unlock.- The cases for the XR on Amazon are so thick that of there can be no question of transparency. Very thick, milky and make the iPhone additionally unhandlicher.Nun to the annoying stuff in my view- As I have already mentioned very large hands, but I consider the XR including sleeve with one hand to use as catastrophic. It's heavy (weight), with the thumb you can never reach the top edge (open control center) and activate the one-hand mode (with a wiper down) does not always work or quit alone before you could perform an action (especially in Snapchat conspicuous) - I have a constant feeling it falls out of my hand.- The low resolution compared to the Xs or X (pretty much the same price) does not justify the high price. Conclusion: After a day, the XR migrated without signs of wear and polished back, because immediately shell and protective film were attached. Even if the display is nice and big, the camera / speaker notch reduces the feeling. The most important thing with my smartphone is a simple and fast operation with mostly one hand. That was impossible with the XR. For such a price, I expect more. In some places you can still notice that the software has not quite adapted to the notch. Furthermore, I personally miss the home button, due to the one-hand mode. And with hindsight I could have dealt with Assistive Touch. And maybe that's just my impression, but somehow the display seemed cheap. I like to use my iPhone 6s and am a fan of the operating system. I now have some concerns about an X model (due to much better battery life, updates and better resolution). Since the X is smaller than the XR, I think the handling will also be easier. Unfortunately, the XR failed with me.	0
Also I did not get the device from Amazon. It was traded to me as a new service phone against an iPhone 6S. Many have already described the technical details here. I would rather comment on the size, handling and feel. Unfortunately, I had no influence on the choice of my new device. The phone is very big. Way too big for average big / small hands. Even in inhand mode, I find it hard to reach the upper left corner. I've been used to using the phone with one hand for years. The XR is a torment. Also, the weight is a disaster. If you put the phone in a bumper, it gets even bigger and heavier. Writing an e-mail is very tiring for the hand. Absolutely unusable. The change from Touch-ID to Face-ID was a bit hard to get used to. But over time, I find it not so bad. The case itself is processed properly. But the sides of the phone are very slippery, so you have to spend a lot of power on a cell phone, so it does not slip through your fingers. The heavy weight is still counterproductive added. If I could, I would send it back immediately.	0
Now it's over. The XR is now my fourth iPhone. In addition, I own / also had an iPod, an iPad and a MacBook Air. After I was initially excited, I'm just just fed up. It starts with the fact that I pay 850 € for nothing new. And it goes on to say that the XR is a telephone booth. And why in the new version of iTunes you can no longer manually load songs from the PC to the iPhone without splitting the albums into individual songs? It's just backward and weak. I never buy an Apple product again.	0
Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with this iPhone. The display flickers - Apple refuses to accommodate me in this regard or make a repair.	0
I had to sink the iPhone XR back in less than 2 weeks, as it came under the glass of the display to scratches / hairlines. Also, the on and off button did not respond as desired. For the price of such a device should not have such defects. Also you can find on the subject of display already entries in the Apple Forum. The problem was already in the Xer and there it ignored Apple at the beginning and dismissed.	0
Worst display I've ever seen in a smartphone in this price range. Have times on the Samsung Galaxy S7 parallel to Xr run a video. The S7 is much better. The black value of the Xr is ridiculous. Other manufacturers make that much better. Amoled makes it possible. Too bad, because I find the operating system Umschlagbar and the quality is also true. Iphone XR is most likely going back. Ahja, the camera I think synonymous not necessarily good.	0
the devices may be good and nice, but the backwards compatibility of the apps leaves much to be desired. Apss, which were installed about 2 years ago, can no longer be used. The developers can not expect it to adapt 3-4 times a year their program. Has Apple ever heard of a compatibility mode? Now I'm sitting on countless apps that are no longer running. THANK YOU APPLE! Not a single penny will you see more of me.	0
In a nutshell: The technique of this device is the lowest cannon. I switched from an ip7s to the xr and am still disappointed 4 months after purchase. The disappointment is also getting bigger, the more software problems are added. Where should I start ? Face ID: she does not recognize me when it is too dark, when the phone is too far away from the face or when I wear sunglasses. Too: is feeling worse than from the 7s, many movements and gestures are barely or not recognized Incidentally, this device has no more 3D touch, where I think with the flashlight function you could have used this well here ... pity Resolution: if a friend shows me samsung for 150 ¬ less, sometimes I could just cry. I use and I can only warn at the moment !!! Apple says it was due to the software, but already for 3 months? Very often, one of the two Sim's.his disabled, there are no calls or text messages' But as long as you do not want to send or dial out via this number, you just do not notice it and wonder why nobody answers. The reception is still displayed normally, so there is no way to be aware of it , When the device restarts the problem is fixed. The first month everything worked and since the 2 month I have to restart the device every 2-3 days.	0
I have the iPhone XR now about half a year and will sell it again. Very annoying is that there is no fingerprint scanner, the unlocking by face recognition works well during the day, but is often times at night on the road is completely unusable. Further annoying is completely uncharacteristic of Apple, that the device hangs often times, this observation have made acquaintances of mine, who also own the device.	0
Wanted to switch from Samsung to Apple, but unfortunately that was a step backwards. The low resolution of the display, "just" neat photos and the battery life could make my old Samsung S8 much better. You pay dearly for a mediocre product with technology and innovations that other manufacturers have had for a long time.	0

I try to keep it short and sweet. The smartphone itself is great. Valuable processed. Display on my part completely sufficient, performance impeccable and service also great. I come from the Galaxy S8 myself and was a little disappointed with Samsung's battery packs as well as the abysmal update policy even on Google's Pixel phones. But why am I going to pull a shipping sticker to return the cellphone from Amazon? Permanently comes a jerky, loud Schmatzgeräusch. This is only noticeable on my side, regardless of VoLTE and occurs only on phone calls and not on Whatsapp or Facetime. My interlocutor does not hear anything. The basic function of the phone does not work, that's just not to understand for me in such an expensive device. Repeated full reset without backup did not solve the problem. Other sim no solution. If one searches "" Iphone X / XR / XS Crack "" one finds also some threads both in Germany as well as with linking in the USA where the problem is described and also Youtube videos exist. So it is not an isolated case and repeated exchanges are described there as unhelpful. The Apple support itself knows except "" ... give it in the repair "" no advice. Furthermore, a significant stuttering or judder is noted when Apps are re-opened and you scroll in a newly opened menu item. This affects Whatsapp, DB App, Instagram, settings, images ... speak it is not specific to the app but overall. Here, too, search for iphone stutter and you will find plenty. Update: Exchange device knows at least so far no pop / smack or jerks when telephoning. Will show if this remains so. A relatively loud background noise remains. The Iphone6 ​​or Samsung S8 is completely quiet in comparison, both when not said and when spoken. Luck or stutter when scrolling through newly opened pages (contact list, Whatsappchat, Instagram, settings list ...) still available. Supposedly IOS13 should run better in the beta but honestly, I would not like to test it out now and should be half a year after release sowas already solved.Update 2: Ploppgeräusche are synonymous with the replacement device with Vodafone, Otelo and Telekomsimkarte. I'm sorry but there I grab my head and evaluate another star.	0
Do not buy! When opening the iPhone received an error message that the camera is defective. So go to Apple and get told that it would have been opened once and no new product. Returned immediately. Finger off! Better spend a few euros more for a safe purchase.	0
The delivery was very fast! This is simply the only thing that was good about it. The smartphone came in an already externally damaged packaging. The original packaging of the iPhone has already been opened! The accessories were simply scrounged in! And the instructions that were included in the normal case were missing completely We will send the product back immediately, as we can not rule out the suspicion of a fake.	0
I ordered an Apple Iphone x 64 GB and to my fright I got an Archos. That does not work .... I am really angry and disappointed ...	0
Good day, for just under 900 euros, I expect that the device is working properly and processed. After use, I have found that the Mute button on the side of the device has more play, until, for example. from silent to loud, as with the iPhones of my colleagues. Say it wobbles easily if you run a finger over it. After a conversation with an Apple employee, it turned out that this button should normally be rock solid and should not have a game. He also said that as long as it does not restrict functionality, that's not bad, yet a minimal assembly error. It may sound fussy, but with the price I expect 100% quality on a new device.	0
For the second time within the first 2 months, the display is defective. First, the earpiece was broken within the first 2 weeks, after which a new display was installed in the Apple Store.Ca. 1.5 months later, the display is completely green. Nothing is happening anymore. Since the 30 grace days of Amazon are over, I have to now again spend my time in the Apple Store. Quality assurance at Apple seems - compared to the price range - completely unacceptable.	0

The Iphone is offered here too expensive	0
There is not much to say. I ordered a new device directly from Amazon. The box was in original packaging. Unfortunately, I then discovered a very visible scratch on the iPhone display. The hope that this is hopefully only on the protective film disappeared after removing it. I'll send the phone back. What's this for? Why are there quality controls if they do not find obvious defects or mistakes on such an expensive product?	0
Everywhere it is stated that it can be used up to 30 minutes maximum 1 meter under water. Once in the bathtub and it does not work anymore! And this terrible company still does not want to exchange it ..	0
I have now switched back to Android with a larger display. The only two positive things I liked about the iPhone X were the look and feel and the ability to sync with my other Apple devices like Mac and iPad. Otherwise, the device is just snot. Battery life is not intoxicating, I do not like the operation synonymous, the camera is not better than other, much cheaper devices. In some situations, it is even worse. I find it absolutely ridiculous, why Apple does not finally extend the camera mode times ... professional mode, new filters, etc. All wrong. At IOS, I miss so many opportunities and simplifications that I have with Android, such as Always on display, splitsreen, mirror-share or mirror-screen, fast closing of all apps, etc. For Android, my device connects to e.g. directly after switching on e.g. with my Bluetooth speaker, the iPhone can not do that and I always have to connect the device manually. What bothers me so animal is that always Bluetooth automatically turns on ... what is this shit? I would like to determine if and when I turn on Bluetooth. Did I already mention the missing fast-loading part ?! Since Steve Jobs is no longer with us, it's not really progressing any more and the new iPhones confirm that absolutely. Since one wants to let now the last loyal Apple customers bleed properly, with up to 1600 € for the new devices. Absolutely ill. I do not need to write about the endless problems with IOS and Apple hardware, you can read about it almost every week on the net. So I can only advise anyone from Apple, who would like to do something more than phone calls ... oh yes, there was not something with the reception problem ;-) And if there is now the argument ... at Apple, you get yes for years updates ... may be, but with the blatant weaknesses, I prefer to buy every 2-3 years a new Android Phone for half or a third of the price and then always have the latest software and the latest technology.	0
Autumn 2018. After my iPhone 6s, I had painfully switched to a Galaxy S8 (got the S8 for free). Terrible conversion from iOS to Android. And yes, even after about 5 weeks now I'm still cursing now and then on Android. A step back to the 6s was no longer possible; I was used to the big OLED display of the S8. However, after I really go off some iPhone features, I recently got myself an iPhone X 256m. Comparable surface S8 and X. Both from 2018 BJ. Both OLED from the house Samsung.- S8 has the sharper display. You can see it. Despite all the "" from xy ppi one sees no difference .. "" BUT! Looks man.- S8 has the harsher colors (I do not like myself, here is the iPhone better) - S8 has the sharper camera with the harsher colors (not realistic, but sharper and brighter) .- S8 with Android is customizable, iOS Static is always static. For this, iOS always and everywhere runs with all compatible devices (eg in the car, on the hi-fi system, etc.) - ... etc. In principle, there are nuances and thus differences to be forgiven. The reason why I still hand over the iPhone X.- Prices / Performance is subterraneous compared to the S8- The viewing angles are quite stable in S8, the iPhone X discolored with minimal movement, the display so strong that it annoys me animal (pictures, etc. are simply distorted by the "" handling "". Here, the "" Farbadjustment "" does not help, it is the Blickwinkel.Und before anyone asks ... I have sent it and (today) get the "" repaired "" Phone with a new display (Therefore, today the unnerved review. Finally, have my proof before and after the repair.) Minimal improvement, a few tiny degrees more are now in. It is not enough Here, the S8 is so much better, and only costs 1/3 of the iPhone X. both phones side by side and moves the devices synchronously, you can see quite quickly the difference. What brings me the "" better "" Color / Brightness / ... Appearance of the iPhone X when the colors / presentation in the "handling" of the phone so deteriorate that it annoys you?! Apple, maybe the end of 2019 or the end of 2020 again. If any.	0
I have had many devices from Samsung to Apple to Huawei, the device is one of the biggest flops I ever had! Of course there are also positive sides such as eg. the camera or the really noble design but after I had the device in my hand I just thought my god how could I spend so much money on such a cell phone which honestly could not really convince me .. Let's get started the design itself is all very well, but of course the price is too exaggerated, because you only pay the logo .. the device I had some days of course in use it runs in the end quite fluently and has no jerks or such, apps open and close incredibly fast and the power quality is great, too, but you would have the price of about 150 to 200 ¬ set so that the device corresponds to its price, there are other Android devices that definitely for 450 to 500 ¬ as much and usually even have a better display .. An iPhone I would never buy back then the devices were still okay for the price but today is there s all GeldmagereiFor absolute Apple fans, the device is of course a highlight! And I say so the device ansich I liked quite okay but the price is what I am a thorn in the eye .. If my recession in the purchase decision helped him further, I would be happy about a helpful vote	0
Battery lasts only 7.5 hours with an average of 1 hrs screen time, my old 6 he iPhone has kept 2 days of total scrap .... Best selling the overpriced smart phone in America. My opinion is: total rip-off. I return the 5 day old device	0
No longer in the program at Apple. I wonder why?	0
Have the device purchased via MediaMarkt and with me the display is spinning constantly he turns off no matter what application	0
Beware of not marked B-goods! Originally ordered, the iPhone was also original packaging, but had two scratches on the case!	0
Broken	0
I have never had so bad reception with another cell phone and waited so long for loading YouTube videos. My iPad 2 loads in the same wlan in the double speed. With this phone did not convince.	0
The iPhone X did not start after unpacking, immediately returned it afterwards.	0
After 3 months more than dissatisfied. I've been at Apple since iPhone 2. However, I am absolutely not convinced by the latest model. Various battery problems, software errors and inadequate Service.Zum then a defective display without external influence. Basically I had big expectations regarding the price. However, I was immensely disappointed here.	0
My first IPhone, provided by the company. With, it was clear that it would be a change. But I did not expect that much regression. After 4 months, my impression does not improve. Especially since the operating system is inflexible, inconsistent and not very user friendly. And that's what most Apple users did. The keyboard of Apple zb. Is inaccurate, makes less clever correction suggestions, special characters only with switch. This can be done better. Siri, well. Acts somehow like beginnings of assistance. Back Button is on the top left, often swipes (but not always) and other apps is built back down somewhere. Experience with Amazon Music: Music download in the app is blocked by Apple. Well, congratulations. Furthermore, I notice that inapp purchases are often more expensive than Android. Myibidder costs nothing on Android per bid, with Apple 50 cents !!! To the phone: basically the hardware succeeded. Display good, camera very good (the shots with weak light are bad). Face recognition good, annoying in the car holder. Banking release with face recognition great. Battery okay to very good. Sometimes empty, sometimes it lasts forever. Wireless charging works great and is convenient. My conclusion: who uses and likes assistance systems is wrong here. There are many restrictions associated with the phone. If you like the Apple world is certainly well served with the hardware.	0
At first happy with the phone but then the performance with the days was getting worse and the seller was not ready to send a new one or refund the money. Pity	0
The price is a joke for a cell phone shame you do not gamble for people from the gold or so I get every time the puke when I see these prices	0
Device baptized, tried and thrown directly into the bin! Just dump and spend so much money. Never again iPhone	0
I'm thrilled by this product but only until I tried the waterproofness IP67 (30 minutes in 0.5 m depth) declared by Apple. After 3 minutes in depth about 30 cm, the phone is broken and I get no guarantee from Apple, because Apple sells to you Waterproof phone but he does not guarantee that the phone is waterproof. I am absolutely disappointing and never buy anything from Apple. 1.100, - EUR I threw away !!!	0
Despite very fast delivery (Prime customer), the disappointment came promptly when I unpacked the phone and took off the protective film and lifted the display against the light: - ((in the lower section SCRATCHED.	0
Irreparable damage due to fluid damage. Device was about 10cm under water for a few seconds. Zero goodwill through Apple. Unfortunately, other vendors in the service scope clearly pick up here. Apple flops. 599 € for the replacement of the device. Display damage remains.	0
Since everything has already been said about the Iphone x, I would like to write something about the "" after "". After my Iphone x fell to the floor and the display jumped, I was in the GRAVIS store. A friendly colleague told me that he has not seen many Iphone X yet and he can not tell me if maybe a sensor or something similar has broken down and recommended that I go elsewhere! I then got the Apple Care Number (0800 ...) called, there they tell me for 4 days now that within a radius of 150 km around my place of residence in the next 8 days no more appointments are free. For more than 8 days, employees can not schedule appointments (in 2018). I was therefore advised to call early each morning and hope that I get an appointment somewhere. The repair of the display costs the way 320.00 €, which should be considered when buying synonymous! I will now sell my broken Iphone X on Ebay and buy a SAMSUNG phone again. Unfortunately my move to Apple was not a good idea.	0

The alleged production bottlenecks are rich marketing tricks to make this overpriced price seem normal. Only the 1st batch may be a bit tight. If you could not pre-order one at 3.11 on the 27.10, you'll get one. 21.11 delivered. If you order now after 1 week or after the release only at Apple, it also gets from 21.11.It is the first time that the user experience has deteriorated significantly in an iPhone, because the removal of Home Button brings significantly more disadvantages with the omission of the jack connector. The 5.8 "" display on the paper is even larger than 8plus with 5.5 "". In practice, most apps / videos are not adapted to this stretched ratio. Anyone who has become accustomed to Plus devices, the X-display would be much too small, because areas at upper and lower edges can be hardly used effectively. In the area 5G (if 5g as planned from the end of 2018 standard) X is far behind Note 8 and Huawei mate 10, future-proof in 1 or 2 years, the device is not. With such a 1149-1319 euro device it is already a bit poor. Clearly many problems can be eliminated in the future via software update, if the app developers are already, extra time for a single device variant to invest, nevertheless X is in actual form really no mature product. In China, reseller prices are already just below OVP. It will not be long before the customers come to their senses again and realize how overpriced this Protype is and can not even sell for 500 euros in half a year.	0
I bought the iPhone outside of Amazon and was previously unsure that it will meet its price. When I got the phone then I thought at first that I will never get my old s8 out of the drawer again but after a short time with the iPhone I did not find it satisfying quite the contrary even I was rather disappointed what I was there for over Had bought 1100 €. Design: The iPhone has a nice and very finished design with the display off. The metal ramen feels very good (better than, for example, the iPhone 8) and gives the device a certain stability. However, if the display is on the whole phone seems somehow immediately cheap rather like a not yet finished and not yet finished covered prototype as a finished iPhone x.Performance -) Display: The display is really good because Apple has done a good job it is on the level of a galaxy s8. Oh yes, the display is not from Apple itself but from Samsung. Apart from the fact that I do not think it's good that Apple praises itself for the display and it was not produced by them at the end, it offers good if not the best black was in a mobile phone. However, it is not as razor sharp as Samsung (and that is one if you have been half a year ago, a galaxy s8 would immediately on) also it is not as bright as the competition. Software: The software is good and clear, but where is the homebutton, which would simply be replaced by a bar that you have to swipe up to get back to the home menu. This is not a big problem at the first moment but it annoys easily even after weeks of use I would immediately exchange it for the homebutton again. Much better this problem would be solved (no more room for the homebutten) with Samsung here there is similar to the iPhone 7 a homebutten without a button. That is the s8 namely by a deceptively real vibrate adjusted. The rest of the software is Apple typical. Personally I would prefer Android with the launcher of the s8 but that's just a joke. Battery: You come through the day and I do not need more. Other: What strikes first (if you take the device in hand) is next to the missing homebutten the missing fingerprint sensor. He was replaced by Face id. This is in good German just a face scanner unlocked your phone. Face id is not bad but I would prefer a fingerprint sensor. The new iPhone :-) possession of the finally wireless charging.Fazid: The iPhone x is not a bad phone and it would be for a price of 400 to 500 euros really ok but for 1100 euros Einstigs price really times overpriced. Especially because with the iPhone x, as with any other iPhone, I always have the feeling of saving the apple at every point - no SD card slot because otherwise you would not be able to demand so much extra storage money - just a display with full HD resolution - Unbelievably small delivery for 1100 € no adapters you have to buy for a lot of money anyway. For Samsung that is different.- cheap China headphone and so on. Because of the above mentioned things and because I have become aware of the purchase of the iPhone x once again how good the Samsung Galaxy S8 is, I have decided to s8 against the drawer If you need a status symbol where he can say wonderful with the iPhone should pick x but who probably have the best and invariant phone should definitely the Samsung galaxy s8, s8 plus or Note 8 because these phones are just better.	0
Every time the same f ** k with the stuff of the should now be my sixth iPhone. Normally it is always broken after 1.5 years of battery, etc. But now it happens after three weeks. Screen flickers after unlocking and changing an app. I can use the iPhone only ten seconds because it goes back into the lock mode, apparently the battery is too weak after my experience. Now the iPhone x costs even more than 1000 euros and it still is not right. Price-performance ratio is zero.	0
use the samsung s8 since april and was or is still enthusiastic.have also today an iphone x and due to the high expectations a little disappointed.first I want to say that I have many ios and android devices, so I have no problems with the change .beide mobile phone have the latest technology and are here on.iphone x clearly too expensive. but with operating system ios runs better than android.	0
on the upper side in the middle, is missing with each device a piece of display. In addition, the developers have forgotten the headphone jack probably in China	0
Great phone but still the price is next to it if you know (secured) what Appel in the production costs just ...	0
The smartphone should have been under the 1000 € limit, then it would buy the people, and the price-performance ratio would be right.	0
For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Only good if the phone with the display is up on the table! Warranty / Guarantee: Although the iPhone X is really high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Stiftung Warentest rated the iPhone X even as "the most fragile iPhone ever". "Apple generally gives its products only 12 months of manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the pricing policy almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone X from the my assessment of a star refers exclusively to the criticisms mentioned above.Note: factual comments I am happy to answer, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and nicely with criticism ht can handle! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.	0
I was always very happy with the previous iPhones, so I put up with the damn high price for the 256 GB model. The iPhone X is just garbage. The touchscreen is not responding properly. At the edge, movements with the finger are not recognized or not recognized correctly. Zooming with the 2-finger gesture works in Safari only randomly, because as soon as you take your fingers off the screen, the zoom effect is back to standard back. Apart from the incredibly poor operation, not even Apple works since the last iOS update Carplay right. There are always disconnections and Apple support does not help you. There are only "" you have already tried another cable or iPhone "" standard answers. If you throw € 1,000 in the garbage bin, that's better than buying this phone. At least you will not have any trouble after the purchase.	0
I do not understand why you build cell phones that have poorer reception compared to older models? I was really looking forward to being on a mobile phone to find out that it has almost zero reception at my home. To top it all off, something went wrong (they did not explain what exactly), so I had to wait almost two months for the credit !	0
Since you ordered an iphone x, opens the box at home, then is such a cheap noname cell phone inside. Catastrophe !!!!!!	0
Considering that the iPhone X is already throttled by software ... Thus Appel itself attests insufficient performance ... the phone is ultimately still a middle class device. To the current courses one must be pretty simple as a user of the now after throttling the X buys already. Definitely never an iPhone again .. as long as the performance of the devices is not even worth half of the purchase price.	0
A good device, but I still forgive only two stars. I bought the iPhone in December 2017, so it has now "tested" a good one year. I think on the basic materials and on the software, I do not have eingehen.Was the quality Furthermore, the fact that iPhone scratched extremely fast, especially the frame, which is why I use an armored film and a protective cover, does not look sooo good, but otherwise the iPhone would not look good long. What the price / delivery / quality concernsThe iPhone cost 1,149 Euro and that's really hard. The package is nothing special included, I would have liked an alternative to the wired headphones in particular. In Decmeber 2018 it was time, the touch screen made great problems, hardly responded. From the next Apple authorized dealer, matching the problem, Apple has just launched a recall, waiting for the repair 1 month, there is no loaner. So you buy a premium product and then the service is, well ... If you now compare the iPhone with the Huawei P20 Pro (which costs less than half), the question is "what exactly is so much better on the iPhone now, what makes the enormous higher price? ". I can not answer this question, because other phones are at least as good. So the iPhone X is a good phone, but it is not better than others and it is worth the extra price by no means. For me it is therefore the last Apple product I bought, because I do not want to support this exaggeration.	0
The design is beautiful, no question. Unfortunately, it needs to be protected, ideally immediately. Thus, the iPhone X looks with shell, like any other phone. Without a cover, this phone loves to slide down everywhere, because glass is smooth. And glass is heavy too. The iPhone X is very heavy compared to other smartphones. This annoys especially with prolonged use and in your pocket. Furthermore, iOS 12 is full of bugs. FaceID suddenly stops working. Screentime names of the devices do not match. Websites can not be scrolled. Text flickers. The quality of the camera is nothing special. Without additional apps, photos can not even equalize. The operation without Homebutton annoying. Again and again nan unintentionally triggers screenshots. Installation of apps with a double-click is cumbersome. If problems, the Apple support arrogance is hard to beat. In summary, no innovation for the inflated price.	0
Did not buy the iPhone x here but at another provider. Unfortunately, I realized that my new iPhone has always become very hot. The battery then empties from 100% to empty within an hour. There were no apps or anything open during this time. It was from now on the same hot, have been buying other models for some time. But I did not know that problem. Often it was not even used when it got hot. Already sad for this price. My went back to the seller after a few days.	0
Unfortunately, I'm not so happy because the phone is sent from Italy. Unfortunately, I have to send it back because an Apple employee advised me to do so	0
First off: Of course, the iPhone X is as good as all the iPhone's before him plus various improvements. The missing button is sometimes really missing, but one has got used to the operation by means of finger gestures quite quickly. Why then 1 star? Because the face (not) recognition drives you to madness. It is already stupid enough that you can not unlock the phone - like the one with finger-touch - directly at the elevation. But that would be bearable, if the facial recognition would work at least at the frontal superiority to 95% plus x. In fact, the rate is below 50%, the immediate detection (as in advertising) even at most 20%. If one can believe the traditions, Steve Jobs would have run in the face of such a worsened product probably in the headquater Amok, so it must be enough that he probably turns permanently in the grave. In any case, I have never owned an Apple product that I had to annoy every hour - to the iPhone X. Apple: Put, 6.	0
Unfortunately it was too small for me	0
I am really disappointed with my order. It has nothing directly to do with the iPhone itself, but with the experience around the order. First of all, the delivery took a full 5 days, although the delivery was made by Amazon itself and usually never takes longer than 2 days. But you can actually ignore that, can happen. Finally, the iPhone arrived and what I was absolutely surprised was that the contents of the package was not protected at all, either with bubble wrap or other "" shock-absorbing "" packaging materials. In view of the price of more than 1000 € it would be more than adequate to secure the goods properly. Especially in view of the fact that the package was even slightly damaged in one place. In my opinion, really not at all. Now we come to the phone itself ... I unpacked it, but let it out for safety because of the cold temperatures outside for 30 minutes lying around, so it warms up to room temperature and the battery is not is charged so heavily. When I wanted to turn the device on, it crashed after about a second. At first I assumed that the battery may be deep discharged. After an hour on the charger still nothing happened. I did a reboot and the iPhone actually went off. After about 30 seconds, however, it crashed again. I suspected a software bug and did a recovery on iTunes. After that, the iPhone finally went and I was able to set it up. After about 5 minutes, the iPhone crashed again and despite all efforts, I could not bring it back to work. All in all, I'm just disappointed. For a purchase price of over € 1000 you can probably ask for a working copy. Above all, I have now waited one week for free. Will not order it again because of this experience. Thanks for nothing. Still a few short notes on the phone itself (if that is possible with a broken device at all). The iPhone X has definitely felt super high quality. The size was great and it was just very good in the hand. As far as the "" exterior "" I was really excited. I also really liked the screen. Personally, for example, Notch did not bother me. The only thing that I found strange is the missing homebutton. You may get used to it, but I personally would not have gotten used to it. Otherwise, the iPhone X has actually not distinguished from its predecessors in the 5 minutes in which I could use it. Therefore, I also come to the conclusion that it is really not worth it, in my view, 300 € more to pay for the iPhone X. In the first few minutes you hold it in your hands you are totally thrilled, but then the euphoria flies relatively quickly and you doubt if it was really a wise decision. You drive with an iPhone 8 (plus) definitely just as good, but significantly cheaper Well, ultimately, everyone must decide for themselves. I was not convinced.	0
At first, I think the facial recognition issue might be a problem, but it works surprisingly well. The screen is great, but pictures and videos look better on the old iPhone just because they have no dent. What I do not like at all are the new swipe gestures. Thus, the entire operation is now overloaded and error-prone. A button can sometimes be really useful, which already had to learn various car manufacturers who wanted to settle everything only on the iDrive.	0
I had my 7er really up to date - software, apps all the best. But never before has the conversion at Apple to the successor cost so much nerve and time like this time. And things are not always going well. As much as I appreciate the latest technology gadgets in the latest mobile generation: I will inevitably extend my renewal cycle. Only update sporadically. Because the changes are just always time consuming and I have neither desire nor leisure for it.	0
I had to exchange the Iphone X for an Iphone 8Plus because I got a headache while using the device. When I turned off Face Id it got better, but my eyes continued to seep when reading websites. I entered "eyestrain with Iphone x" at Google and lo and behold: Many users have this problem due to an unobtrusive flickering of the OLED display. In addition, the attention check of the face-id camera ensures that the face is regularly scanned with UV rays. That can not be healthy! Since I own the Iphone 8Plus I have no more problems with it.	0
I had several manufacturers of smartphones in front of Apple and was by and large satisfied. Now I thought make your experience with Apple, and now have gasammelt after 6 months. Pro: The X Phone is noble and looks great and that's it already. Kontra: The X Phone is very often hang, crashes, does not respond, shuts off and restarts. Lose often the Wi-Fi.Playing quality satisfying, photo camera satisfactory.For the money it is a disappointment.Next cell phone will not want an Iphone.	0
The price is hot and Apple has managed to pull the money out of the people! Apple is happy! Those who spend so much money should question themselves and think about his life. As long as there are people who pay the price, Apple will not change its strategy. Some freaks even take out a loan and I'm glad that my Apple share is rising. Customers are people and not purses! Here goes profit before customer loyalty !!! That's why the next Iphone is even more expensive. The price is a slap in the face of the consumer!	0
Who did not look forward to Apple's new innovation? When I heard about the iPhone X, I stole the order of my iPhone 9S and flew extra to the United States to be one of the first to buy and hold such a gem. I also only had 8 days to go to the Apple Store campen.Zwar I lost my job as Minister of Defense but that was worth it in the end. Because one of the new, innovative features, such as the FaceID, with which Apple has enriched the entire future, was for me the main reason for buying the iPhone X. I'm too lazy to just unlock my phone with my finger. Although you do the phone with your fingers but the sole unlocking me completely aus.Vllt Apple is so innovative and soon developed a new iPhone, which you can control completely only with the eyes, better by telekinesis or thoughts. Would be useful for People who have no hands. Another factor would be the well-known and innovative-bristling OLED display, which is literally soo "cool" that it is sensitive to cold. In order to test this I am even together with NASA and SpaceX traveled to the distant dwarf planet Pluto, where the temperatures are below -600C.- It came out that our spaceship and all supplies froze, the iPhone X, however, ran FAST perfectly. So it was already stable, but it would have at -5 more What to consider as a counterpoint, would be Apple's pricing policy: The phone is me (unemployed) that way too cheap.Denn alone this cool and äuße most useful animation, if you push the widget aside, is in my eyes a fortune of at least € 9999 worth. Stunning thing!	0
Without Samsung, the X would not be possible again or cheap Sharp display perhaps. But good cell phone but see there is nothing special. Much too expensive. Then rather a Galaxy S8 if I need a large screen and for daily iPhone 7 And then about 200 ¬ in the bag and 2 Mobilys.Ne. Is of course good phone but worthwhile not at all. According to US insurers, the iPhone X is the most fragile iPhone ever.Also, cold problem and many green stripe on the display. Really embarrassing apple. And that for so much money? Bad	0
Hello, have made comparison test with Klapphandy: My girlfriend does not sound different with this hypephone. Therefore rather frills for big people. Off to the shelf with it and dusted once a week.	0
Mobile phone was sent damaged. Naughty, do not buy.	0
With my son's cell phone, splashing water caused moisture damage, and this is not covered by the warranty. When applestore he was the "" generous "" offer made that he gets an exchange cell phone for 600 euros (his cell phone was there only 2 months old) and only 3 months warranty for the replacement device. He then went to an independent company, which exchanged him for the cell phone the damaged parts for 300 euros and also offered him 3 months warranty. The device has been working flawlessly for 6 months since the repair.	0
Great and great	0
Unfortunately, the iPhone came broken. When turned on, the screen flickered. Of course, I sent it back directly. Unfortunately I was not notified before ordering that the product would be shipped from France. The manual was in Czech. Finally, spend a little more and be on the safe side. The 30 € to save compared to the store price, it was not worth it. Note: For returns on Amazon over 500 ¬ you have to make a sworn statement so you get the credit. That's what hooked me, only after submitting the affidavit I got my money back.	0
ATTENTION!! I ordered an Iphone 8 and received it quickly. was very satisfied, at first). Then came gradually problems with battery and especially reception -> I send the product to Apple. Apple informs me that MANIPULATIONS have been made on the phone and almost no original parts are available. The dealer merely refers to Apple and does not seem to have to comment. -> Absolute impudence. Must write here, since I can not give the seller a feedback. (probably also controlled).	0
iPhone 8 returned due to volume issues with headphone jack. At full volume on the smartphone you just heard something (quietly) of music / video / call. When background noise (city / sports center) you heard even less of what is being played (Spotify, Youtube, iMusic, etc.). Tried different headphones, even other people (friends / family / friends) to try. Could have been that I am suffering from a hearing (acute) fall. I do not have this problem with my iPhone 5s.	0
The product seemed repackaged but had foils, etc. Air bubbles could be so that it was ever opened. Also, the adapter for the headphones was missing. I'm disappointed that the Amazon sent incomplete things as new.	0
As always great feel, but much too small battery and otherwise made more for the hands of little spoiled children. Tiny screen and a keyboard mocking any description.	0
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY PHONE JUST AUTOMATICALLY SHOT DOWN AFTER 8 MONTHS , SO PATHETIC AND TERRIBLE	0
I bought the iPhone to get it as uncomplicated as possible. However, just delay in delivery (was shipped from France) and then no device, but a fire tv stick from Amazon in the package! On the packaging is also another shipping sticker with Italian name .. just a corrosive extra effort! Now I get back the money after returning, but since this is an external seller, not automatically a new device.	0
The price has lured, but the cell phone is not convinced: neither headphones were there, nor was it in its original packaging. The packaging itself contained "Demo - not for resale". On demand as this came about, I was just put off and only on the missing headphones. Apple & Amazon were informed. Please take care!	0
Hands off! The iPhone is only new at first glance! Luckily you can send it back via Amazon. But you could have saved yourself the trouble. It is sad that such providers are allowed to sell on Amazon.	0
I was a neutral mobile phone user from the beginning, I did not care if I would ever use IOS or Android. One day I thought that I could buy a smartphone from Apple for a change. This choice I regretted quickly, just to understand I was previously neither totally excited by one of the other ..... Super part of this part can tell me when I have to move, can me with one or the other hardware from Apple my pulse Announcements, can pay with it & in two years it will probably breathe and revive people. It puts every value on other things, but that Apple sells smartphones for this price, which does not even trivialities (transfer pictures, download one or the other) without the 30 tutorials and 12 apps must load is worthless in my opinion! I am disappointed that this mega-group is going to lift such a hype for something that is not worth a penny more than any other mobile phone! Nice that this thing can play so much future music, but fails with the simplest things! Hopefully some will understand and continue to pump so much money into this brand before not even trying anything else, which is a lot better for less money ...	0
Was locked with another account so not new! Impudence.	0
I was lured by the price ... unfortunately that was a mistake! The A-Montain vendor did not send an iPhone 8 for the German market as in the description, but an iPhone for the Czech market. See pictures. Unfortunately, when the call came out at Apple that this iPhone was already logged in and therefore no new product! This is a clear case of fraud for me! Amazon has already received notification and forwards it to the appropriate instance. So people, keep away from such offers, so you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.	0
Unfortunately, even with this device a wrong barcode, cheap glued over. Instead a model for the German market, I have a receipt for the Czech. Since I did not get what was offered here, there is only one star for fraud.	0
What can I say that is positive, it actually came an iPhone 8 as ordered. BUT: not intended for the German market as so often (in product description and in response to customer questions) promised by the seller. To camouflage that was "sent "Placed a sticker, I called as a precaution Apple and not even knew the codes on the back. Was then too delicate and I got the phone (still original packaging, therefore no idea if it works or not) sent back. Borderline in my opinion to fraud, especially because here the identity is deliberately veiled and advertised with "mobile phones for the German market." Funny Funfact: I have waited comparatively long for the refund and therefore called Amazon. If you return a higher-quality article - even though it has arrived completely - you have to sign an affidavit first. For every nonsense you get an e-mail. I would be informed about this on demand. Which, of course, the seller now can not do anything, this point affects only Amazon itself.	0
Offered and ordered was a vendor neutral (!) IPhone MQ6H2ZD / A 8 64 GB silver. After a delivery time of 2 days, I received the device with unofficial glued serial or article numbers. Conspicuous was the conformity guarantee of the company Vodafone (!) In Italian. It may indeed be that the devices for the different EU countries do not differ technically, but no one guarantees me that on the device not pre-installed Vodafone software or apps that you either do not want or may not get off the device. Therefore, I do not necessarily agree with a pre-review on the safety of deviating article numbers. Everyone likes to assess the risk for themselves, for high-priced items, I simply expect a correct settlement (ordered = delivered). The item is therefore zurück.Verpackung and delivery time flawless.	0
I can not sell the phone because there is no German bill !!! For private no preference, for self-employed bad ... thank you Amazon ...	0
If there was no star. When the order arrived, no cell phone was found in the box. The cardboard for such a high-quality goods was a simple cardboard box without additional bonding! After immediate complaint and Rückabwicklungswunsch came only after the second request the statement one had to deal with DHL because only complete "" packages " In my opinion, this can not be the task of the buyer in this non-delivery. In addition, now Amazon with switched on and also the DHL process in the way. Nevertheless, no action / Reaction let alone answer of the seller. My advice: Better fingers away ... have now also only Rennerei!	0
I'm switching from my old iPhone 5s to the iPhone 8 and I'm really excited! Beautiful phone !! Once you have an iPhone, you always want one again. Delivery thanks prime very fast. Update: After 4 months, the phone hangs up suddenly and I can no longer operate the touch. Also, the lock state is no longer cause. I've never had that with one of my iPhones. Neither software update nor reset to factory state has brought something! I look forward to the proposed solution by the seller ..	0
After less than 2 months the Touch ID is broken !! Just broken from one day to the next! I can not recommend it!	0
I ordered one, got something else. Hopefully just a mistake.	0
Actually madness for the device to spend so much money. The bad thing is the LG and Samsung already have borderless displays and I should pay even more for the botch. If I want rimless Apple, should I buy the apple X and pay double the sls at the competition? Fingerscanner simply missing, because you did not get the housed? Sorry apple gave my contract out directly sold. This is murks and next year, all Apple models are guaranteed to be borderless except for the Se.	0
Not so good! Have the iphone since March and am shocked how sensitive it is against scratches and cracks in the display and housing. Without a protective cover it should probably never be used. Software is also weak, the preinstalled card app ranges e.g. I do not need any additional apps from the competition. Very little compatibility with other products, sometimes even with those that should be made especially for Apple. Photos of the camera are in good light very good, in low light quite bad. With the standard camera app hardly any settings possible. I will hardly buy an expensive second camera app. Why are not photos taken the same size as the display? There are always edges, with videos it fits. In the beginning, wiping across the screen did not always work properly, which only got better after an update. Actually, I like the device only the performance, until now it runs smoothly and fast. There is just one star. There are deductions for the price, which is far too high. Trigger for the sensitivity. Deduction for software errors that the support will fix late or not. Fingerprint sensor does not work on slightly sweaty or wet fingers. I've read the same finger three times, now it's okay. In advertising, the man drove his skateboard through the lawn sprinkler, in reality, he would not get it unlocked ..... I'll stop writing, otherwise it will be too long.	0
Even Apple seems to weaken occasionally. So are currently devices from the production period of the middle of the year 2018 called back by the manufacturer. A defect on the motherboard was found. The result showed u.a. In the form of a "" frozen "" display or the separateness of the Touchscreens.Leider I had to give back in March bought IPhone 8 again. Not all devices were affected. On the homepage of Apple is listed in more detail. At least there can be seen (input the serial number) which device is affected. I can only rate the iPhone 8 with 2 stars, although I have always been satisfied with Apple devices. Shame!	0
On the phone itself everything is fine. However, I would like to write my disappointment. It's my first and also my last iPhone. The only reason I keep the device is because it allows me to calibrate my Sonos system. In my opinion, according to the current state of technology, a few things are missing on the iPhone or Apple does not consider it necessary to offer the customer a service. In the App Store, it is not possible to test apps. It means, buy it or leave it. I think there is no one who has not yet experienced that an app is not running. In the Google Store every purchase app can be tested 2 hours. It's not possible the iPhone, which has rather a smaller display, with only one hand to operate. Although Apple offers the screen virtually to bring down, but that is awkward in daily use. It simply lacks a back button or short key. The camera: Is good, but simple knit. I miss the feature that front and rear camera simultaneously take a picture and put it together. The panoramic function is only portrait, not landscape! I use SwiftKey, again Apple limits the function of writing. On the iPhone, I write a lot slower because the intuitive features of SwiftKey are limited by Apple, some are missing. Apple is forcing its users to use two-thumb spelling. And Siri is dumb compared to the Google Assistant. I have to narrow down a topic in advance. For example, if I'm looking for a street I have to tell Siri to search the internet because otherwise only the phone will be searched. The Google Assistant uses every opportunity. I do not use Siri any more. There are other things that are annoying, but that's probably my subjective opinion. Two stars, because the design is successful. Maybe that helps one or the other decide, if he wants to change to Apple ,	0
In principle, the device is perfect in almost all respects. However, there are two things that bother me enormously at this price. The speakers are the worst I've ever heard, they can play very loudly, but the sound quality is subterranean, the high notes are too overpresent and drown out the overall very thin sound spectrum, even the s9 felt more "bass" "2. The system performance leaves something to be desired. Noticeable in many situations are micro-stutters that should never exist at such a price.	0
I was really looking forward to the new iPhone 8. Unfortunately, some of the apps - including the Eistellungen - froze over again, so that you had to restart the device completely. I can not use that. Also, it is much heavier compared to my old 5s. I do not know how anyone can handle the iPhone's X, Xs or Xr.	0
The phone arrived in original packaging, everything looked ok. Unfortunately the people I call can not here me clearly most of the time.	0
Unfortunately, I have had very disappointing and bad experiences: After a few years and two android phones, I decided again for an Apple iPhone and bought me in September 2018, a new iPhone 8 for around 650 ¬. I was completely satisfied and fell in love again with the surface, the handling, the operation and the shape. I could not have imagined a better phone ... Until in May 2019 suddenly my outdoor camera stopped responding, my flashlight stopped working and the mobile phone often reported a simcard error. Over a three-quarters of a year, I was very careful and handled the phone carefully. I never fell down and was protected all the time with a solid case and a protective glass. So I thought: A clear guarantee. After a short phone call with the AppleSupport the phone was picked up for repair at my home and was already in the repair center at Apple 2 days after the phone call. In the phone call, I was told that Apple repaired any damage or repaired no damage at all. After a few days, I got feedback from Apple: On my phone, another defect was found, which does not include the warranty and thus expire. There were pictures of the corresponding "defect" attached. These were my loudspeakers, in which was dirt, lint, etc. of my trouser pocket. I already knew that. Anyway, Apple declared this as a defect and demanded for the total repair of my eight month old iPhone a contribution of 317,02 € + tax (!!!!). I feel pulled over the table and unrestrained abgezockt.Warum I pay 650 ¬ for a telephone, which has eight months after technical failures, then I'll even crappy for my warranty and on top of that also roughly ¬ 350 as repair costs for damage that is not in my responsibility is to pay? Why should one still buy Apple products there? For 350 ¬ there are now android phones that have at least as good a performance as the iPhone 8. What I find almost saddest: not a coworker has my actually problem, the defective camera or the flashlight ever accepted. Neither at the 'repair' nor on the phone. It was always about the speaker "defect" and about the fact that I alone have to pay for the repair. I have the cell phone returned unrepaired and have visited a local mobile workshop. I have during the Apple "repair" almost 14 days to give up my mobile phone. An indictment of a company like Apple. Here, as a customer as I have now found, just ripped off. To offer the customer help stands at Apple probably now at the bottom. That would never have been in the sense of the inventor. I am very disappointed.	0
I was like many others surprised by the Preis.Bei the delivery then came the explanation why the price could be so low. I have received a demo device, which is not actually intended for resale. The device itself is needed, but in a very good condition. Unfortunately already bought in Oct. 2017, so I only had 5 months warranty from Apple. I would not buy it anymore. If I spend so much money on a smartphone, then please for a new and ovp !!	0
The phone has come with slight cosmetic damage to the display. The speech from the manual is in Polish or Slovak and not in German.	0
Great device, handy, fast, solid ................ But, I do not allow this patronizing of iTunes, with 12.7 I can not even use my own mp3 as a ringtone ... Thanks, no, throttles the performance of your devices and "curbs" your customers with extremely overpriced devices.	0
I have an Ipad, I am very happy with that, but the Iphone, no! we are now living in the 21st century, and just because it's apple ??? my apps, which I bought for my Android, are not transferable! You have to pay again! Great! 1 slot !! That's a joke! On my Android device I have 2 slots, for business and home, plus a slot for a memory card! Ok, apple has an adapter, of course, everything costs extra, and the iphone anyway almost 3 times as expensive as the Android .... etc. etc.	0
I've been using iPhones 3, 5, 6s, and now 8, which I did not buy from Amazon for years. But I think the Amazon is the best 'consumer channel' for a review. I've been using the phone for about half a year, and basically it's still a great smartphone but not as good as the 6s. But there are a few points that are really annoying: - The missing headphone input. Of course, there is a matching headphone and an adapter with it, so that especially perfectly organized people have no problem with it. Unfortunately, I can not bite, and of my many headphones fits now only one, and that, who is currently not there, and the adapter, I also constantly misplaced.- The GPS reception in the car is not working properly. It sometimes takes minutes for the phone to hear that I've turned off. It is probably a common problem with the reception, which is discussed on communities, I had so far only time to worry about it and have no solution- The new home button is also getting used to. He has no more resistance than at the 6s and often he just does not react. One presses desperately repeatedly until something happens.We still wonder that sales of iPhones is weakening. Perhaps Apple executives should increasingly think about whether they are acting in the interests of their customers. Incidentally, this also applies to the further development of iOS. Personally, I would wish for many features and Apple apps, the aspect of simple and straightforward usability back into focus. The two stars explicitly include the comparison with the previous one.	0
I have received the phone in an externally good condition. It should be an original product. Unfortunately it was not in perfect condition. After only 3 weeks it started to crash. Meanwhile, the music playback, the camera and the phone does not work properly. The use of the product is mainly problematic. I'm assuming that I have not received a new product. I bought the phone directly through Amazon to exclude just as disappointing ability. Unfortunately, I spent 900 ¬ for a broken product. Too bad.	0
I'm a big fan of Apple and have already had the iPhone 4, iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 in front of the iPhone 8 plus and was also very happy with it. But on the iPhone 8 plus display, I already have so many scratches although I'm just as good or poor as the predecessor treat. That's why I'm already thinking about whether I'll zulege again an older model. Apple Care replaced the display unfortunately only at break or another defect. Therefore, I give only 2 stars and they are almost too much ,	0
Was very disappointed with the product, the cell phone was delivered purely from the packaging is not a new device, the package was obviously already opened and re-glued again, also was the barcode on the back of the packaging just torn off. Since the appearance of the packaging made me startling, I sent the thing back immediately. Annoying that a new phone is sold for $ 800 proud and then you get something, even more at Christmas (was a gift). If I buy a new device, then (especially at the price) must be completely new - especially since I could not technically check the device. Unfortunately, I can only advise against it	0
Unreliable ... Never order again!	0
3G, 4, 5, 6 Plus, 6S Plus. The 8 Plus is the first iPhone, the purchase of which I regret and gives me little added value in practice compared to the 6S Plus, on the contrary. This starts with the very nature of a phone calling , Directly after delivery discussions were accompanied by an unpleasant crackle. A later version of iOS brought a workaround by software, yet voices sound much more metallic flatter, unnatural than the iPhone 6S. Something that not only shows on the phone, but also the sound of video recordings. Photos and videos have more dynamics in the evening or dark situations and the white balance is better. In addition, there is 4K recording capability with 60fps and higher frame rate in slow motion. Something that you can only use if you leave the default set more compressed encoding format. Compared to the normal video / image format, it saves a lot of space, but the pictures are muddy, details are lost, so that in sum there is hardly any benefit left. The display is marginally better in comparison to the 6S, but you can see the main difference at night, because the 8 Plus darkens more. In practice, only the iPhone X shows a qualitatively remarkable jump. Also, only on paper one has something of the higher performance. There were no applications for me on the 6S that would have been too slow and those that have jerked on the 6S are also jerking on the 8 Plus. That said, it's the programming of the app, not the performance. Support for wireless charging is certainly an advantage for those who use it. The necessary glass back makes it more sensitive to falls than the metal back of the 6S. Certainly one can argue about what is more aesthetic. If you use a bumper, you can only see the camera slits and tiny differences in the front of the speakers, whether it's a 6, 6S, 7 or 8. Anyway, better water protection is an advantage. I've used all the iPhones in the water so far and could avoid a water damage, but it is certainly not a mistake in case of the cases to be armed. Unfortunately, this water protection is at the expense of the headphone jack. Again, everyone likes to discuss individually who uses them, how much / uses them. In any case, it is one feature less and, in case of necessity, forces an adapter that does not actually improve the sound quality.The battery is smaller than the 6S. Due to the better processor efficiency this should be more than balanced. As far as the final version of iOS 11 is concerned, that is quite a comprehensible statement and even exceeds the runtime of the 6S. However, the thing has a taste. The iOS 11 beta release in early August was the best operating system version ever on the 6S in terms of energy efficiency. Even the optimized iOS 10 versions could not keep up with that. With each new version, the battery life of the 6S was reduced significantly, so that in the official iOS 11 version almost twice as often the 6S had to be loaded than a few weeks before. It's understandable, of course, that Apple is optimizing iOS 11 with a focus on iPhone 8 and X at the end and less on the old models, as I said, it has a connotation anyway. The biggest horse foot of the 8 Plus, however, is the GPS accuracy. In no iPhone / iPad before, the position was often displayed next to the road, even in the open air. It also does not help to reset the factory and switch the locale as it is sometimes generally suggested. I made a few direct comparisons out there with the 6S and iPad Air 2, and in almost all cases it was the 8 Plus that was the largest in Apple Maps' circle of inaccuracy. One point that I will address to the support, however, is found in forums to relatively many comparable entries in which repair and even device replacement have brought nothing and is spoken under the hand of a design problem. However, in terms of open support contact, this point is not included in the rating. What was and is for me personally the most important upgrade reasons is the increased main memory and the 256GB memory space that was not offered on the 6S model. Since this would have been technically possible, and was only offered for economic reasons, I forgive only one star. The higher internal memory speed and thus reduced upgrade / backup time is worth a second star in practice for me. The better water protection would be a star , he would not at the expense of Kopfhörerbuchse.Die slightly better camera is thwarted by the poorer image quality of the compression. One could discuss in total for 3 stars to award, which would probably be fair compared to smartphones from other manufacturers. On the other hand, the benchmark of my rating is the 6S. Purely by feel, the jump from 6S to 8 in practice is smaller than it was the 6S to 6. So I can not give a clear conscience 2 stars for such a smartphone in 2017, for the Apple requires more than 1000 euros. My recommendation to all 6S owners who manage with 128GB is one year to wait for the successor of the X. Since the teething problems are eliminated and you get a real added value for this money.	0
It's just exactly the same as the iPhone 7 only with a slightly better camera but only because no one should spend so much money for such a drecks cell phone	0
The phone has a good camera but is not special otherwise. It leaves a lot of space next to it and can not compete with Samsung and Huawai mobile phones. I have owned this device for almost a year now and it has become a bit slow. IOS 11 is the worst IOS I've seen so far. It is bended and often crashes the phone. In addition missing important functions, such as: WLAN and Bluetooth can be switched off only on the settings. The phone is too expensive for the performance it brings. I can only advise against it.	0
I already had a 5s in front of the iphone 8 and finally an S6 edge. I'm bothered by the Iphone8's low-resolution display in contrast to the S6. Furthermore, the camera can not handle RAW, and you always have to make do with the images calculated by Apple. The S6 is not an issue that makes dng files + jpg. Wireless loading is in most Android devices for years no issue ..... I give a completely overvalued mobile phone back and will be back for the time being my S6.	0
Attention FRAUD! Seller: TI-Trade, purchase June 2018Ware was delivered quickly, 1. Delivery was defective from the outset, exchange was smooth. The second iPhone, which was delivered seemed to be in commissioning once in order. After four weeks of use, however, showed a defect in the microphone, caller could not understand me despite good cell phone reception suddenly; When playing back videos recorded with the front camera, you could hear noise. I've come to an Apple retailer to claim the 12-month warranty that's usually available on new equipment from the first activation. Based on the serial number was first checked whether the device is still eligible for warranty and to my horror was found that this had already expired. The device was already over 1 1/2 years old, so had no claim to warranty, but was welded sold as new. That's cheating! So I reset the device to factory settings, returned it and demanded my money back. It took a long time until the return was processed despite repeated requests, then the seller said, I did not disable the "iPhone Search" feature and he would now need my Apple ID and password. Haha! Luckily that could be done from a distance (without giving any passwords) and now, after three months back and forth, I finally got my money back. The whole thing has cost me a lot of time and nerves, countless e-mails had to be written and I did not get my money for three months (almost 500 €). I can only warn against a purchase!	0
The dealer TI-Trade are cheaters! The newly acquired with iPhone 7 was already two years old and needed. When I got the iPhone, I had it analyzed on the same day at Apple. It was found that the cell phone was used for the first time two years ago and was reset in March 2018. Thus, of course, the warranty has already expired and it is therefore not new. In addition, was missing in the packaging, which was rewelded incidentally, the adapter from Lightning to Aux. The service of TI-Trade was very bad. No one was available by telephone and I got the money only 5 days after the two-week deadline.	0
Purchased cell phone in june. Nothing works now. Apple says the phone was bought in 2016 in the UK, so no warranty anymore. The battery was already exchanged before the purchase. That was a flop. Many Thanks!	0
Attention, scams! No new! Have got a used device! Various scratches, Zergrabbeltes and discolored charger, geknautschte OVP.Der battery does not hold what he should. Here you are pulled over the table!	0
Have the phone now for a while and have recently noticed that the brightness and color of my screen is a bit strange after I compared it with the iPhone 6 of a friend. Her screen was much brighter and whiter, and mine was darker and yellowish. Maybe it's a fake or a fake or just a production mistake, do not know. Except for that, but with the phone everything is fine. But would still recommend anyone who wants to buy an iPhone to buy it in a trustworthy business and I will do it in the future.	0
Scam! - I welded the iPhone 7 at the end of June 2018 and got it sold as new. Because of long-standing problems with the battery, which finally aufquoll, this had - to save the iPhone - quickly replaced on 04.05.19. When opening the phone was clearly stated that the battery has already been replaced and not new. About the serial number could be determined that for this iPhone the warranty period had already expired.	0
Fast delivery, but unfortunately partly defective	0
The i phone is a built-in mobile phone made of several iPhone has only 3months working then i sent it back then i should pay another 100 € please hands off of such merchants	0
A super mobile phone However, the adapter is missing in which one universal headphone etc with the iPhone can connect ... I ask for broadcast!	0
The phone was nice at first. Didn’t like that it didn’t come with headphones but I knew that was going to be the case. It had some dents in it already when I got it which wasn’t the end of the world. But then after a few months the phone randomly overheated and the camera and flashlight stopped working. I tried to return or exchange it which they were willing to do but now it has been over two months since I sent the phone back and I haven’t received a fixed phone or my money back. Now I’m out a phone and a few hundred Euros! Avoid these guys!	0
Good day, the phone is not working anymore, screen is black and will not work anymore. Ask for info as we proceed here. Thanks	0
The phone was sent quickly and arrived on time, but after two days, it is sometimes not charged and turns off at 50% or more simply for several hours. Also as other customers already mentioned this product was already two years old and therefore no new product (so no guarantee)!	0
I bought the smartphone via Amazon at RH Mobiles for my daughter last July. For 2 months, the touch function + Anschaltknof does not work anymore. It goes well for a few days to weeks, then nothing works again for a short time. the mobile phone can not be operated. My daughter was already a few weeks ago at the Apple Store in Munich, they have looked at the phone, but unfortunately could not fix it. That can happen. What I do not accept is that RH Mobiles does not respond to the mails I sent you on July 5th and July 18th, although it says you will be in touch within 48 hours. The next smartphone I will not refer to Amazon. Hermann Probst	0
I ordered and paid for an iPhone 7 declared as "new", but got a used one. I could easily check this by the serial number. Allegedly an oversight of TI-Trade; In my opinion, a nasty scam, because it was really very original wrapped turned - at this point I would like to pronounce a fraud warning.	0
I got my supposedly new iPhone 7 today, but it's not new. Checking the battery capacity of the "new" mobile phone, one sees that only 91% of the original battery work. I hope that with me Kontalt is taken and I get my money refunded !!! Tracing the serial number via Apple.com has shown that the phone has no longer a grant more than one year old and comes from abroad !!!	0
The iPhone was delivered quite fast as usual. Joy was great but short lived. Unfortunately, the device did not turn on and I had to send it back. Ordered me a new one and I'm curious. Therefore only one star!	0
I bought an iPhone 7 for a really good price. It was packed as original as my friend's iPhone X. First, it made me suspicious that on the back only the iPhoen data in English was specified. After opening, I much to the 3.5mm jack adapter was missing and to make sure that it is really a new iPhoen I have checked the serial number. Then came the evil surprise! On the iPhone, the 90-day phone support had already expired! -> So no new smartphone as declared, but used! Contact with TI-Trade recorded, the return was approved very quickly! After that it was quiet! It followed no email to inquiries, etc. Only when I contacted Amazon I was promptly answered and then finally the costs Rückerstattet.Ich that's a right scam of those, the ignorant to turn a used iPhone and then do not respond to any contact! DO NOT buy from TI-TRADE -> used goods !!!!!!!	0
Here is a negative example, got an expensive device in for the Hungarian market (which was not in the description) and for a year stress with AMAZON and the dealer of NO Dt. VAT .. has sold. I wanted to refund this because I live in Africa and have taxed there. Have no chance to get the money back, seller and Amazon refuse and no one sees me responsible.	0
I ordered the iPhone 7 last November and was very satisfied at first, until I took the first pictures. I noticed that the camera often could not fix properly and the image quality was pretty much for the A ****. It was very strange to me, just because Apple is known to have a good image quality. Nevertheless, I was able to live with it. Exactly 6 months later, however, my reservations were confirmed, the iPhone was out, despite loading it could not be switched on anymore and I must add that I treated the mobile phone like in cotton wool (was not exactly that either not much I paid for it). It never fell off, did not get wet and I tried to load it as seldom as possible. I immediately contacted the vendor and unfortunately I just got a standard message in reply, which really disappointed me. Luckily I did not throw in the towel right away and turned to amazon directly. I have to say, Amazon sent me a return slip immediately after my message (without any shipping costs), with the statement I get the full money back , Except for a longer wait and a short response from my side, everything ran smoothly afterwards and I got my money back. Thanks again to the customer service of Amazon, you can really rely on it! The direct provider, however, is more likely to be one Flop .. the Apple devices do not seem to be 100% original and not high quality either.	0
The phone was working very good and I was satisfied with it the first time. But recently when it was on, it stopped reacting out of nothing, the screen got black and the phone started to heat for 2 hours. I brought it to the service centre (the guarantee is still valid), but didn't get a response about what happened yet.	0
I ordered a new iPhone 7. Shipping went very fast and it was there after 2 days. Only when unpacking came the first doubt because the protective film was pretty dirty. Have then entered the serial number at Apple and found that the 1 year warranty had already expired. Thus, it was not a new device as stated but probably only to an already returned and re-sold iPhone. Otherwise, the iPhone worked quite well. By iOS11 could only see that the battery was already at 90% wear. IPhone went back for the simple reason that it was not new.	0
After years of using Samsung, I took the step in the direction of Apple and regret it in several points. Very poor reception no matter wlan, mobile data or normal Telefonienetz.Ich I switched from a Samsung S5 on the Iphone 7 and had directly bad reception. It did not get any better after replacing the sim card. With further searches on the Internet turned out that many people have the problem. What brings me a cell phone where the basic functions do not work? Optical and the operation really top but I live half in the country half in the city and have problems the network problems ( which I did not have before with the S5) Especially with a over 600 ¬ Handy the basic characteristics should work but unfortunately you do not. I'm disappointed and pretty annoyed.	0
It was sent with a probably not new and also locked device. Fortunately, it was successfully exchanged for an unused smartphone, but a lot of nerves and time tasted.Lieber pay a bit more and buy in the shop !!!	0
The iPhone 3GS I had every model to the iPhone 7, this has now changed. The iPhone 7 is anything but a flagship, the integrated and non-expandable memory is heavily strained by APPLE's IOS, the more demanding will play Phone extremely warm, the Bluetoth quality reaches just mediocre. The camera is in comparison to other devices pure mediocrity and from the IPS 68 certification of the iPhone 7, Apple itself does not seem quite convinced (or why else the warranty committee?) My iPhone 7 (including the devices from my circle of acquaintances) were noticeable slower in the course of the last 7-10 months. About 5 months ago, I own a Nokia 8, which dominates the iPhone 7 in really all areas and only the half costs. Unfortunately no purchase Recommendation for Apple and the Iphone 7!	0
About a year ago I bought my wife an iphone 7 with 128GB. The said mobile phone looks through the careful use until today as new. Nonetheless, the phone suddenly became boiling hot (source of danger) and has stopped working since then. The warranty expired a few weeks ago - and goodwill is a foreign word at Apple. For a mobile phone that only lasts for one year and is almost injured, the price is in no way justified. We will turn our backs on Apple after this experience and get a device with better value for money - prestige is not everything in life! However, until the said day, the mobile phone has worked well, albeit no better than comparable competing products.	0
This device was sold as new, however, it is not new. It lacked the detailed German manual. It lacked the Apple stickers, which are to be obtained with each new iPhone. The charger is not new. You can see the dirt under the foil. In addition, the charger does not look original, Above all, you notice it on the edge of the store device.	0
Upon receipt of the delivery, the original packaging of the iPhone was already open, any protective films on the phone are missing and the charging cable is ALT, defective and held together with tape. This phone is obviously not a new product and has already been used	0
The software from Apple has always been lousy and ineffective, but the hardware was good so far. After a good 3 years, my iPhone has given up the ghost peux a peux. After 2 years, the battery had to be replaced, now it is weakening again. Despite the display of 37%, the phone is simply aus.Den price is the device, just like other Apple devices just not (more) worth. Too bad, but there are other manufacturers.	0
I have the phone for about a year. And it has also worked flawlessly, only since the last software update, nothing works! It takes me about two to three minutes to open a web page on the internet, I can not make any updates in the AppStore and all my pictures have been deleted after the update! Absolutely no buy recommendation there are better and above all cheaper cell phones!	0
The delivered I-Phone made a good impression at first glance which is why I did not become suspicious. When after half a year then the battery broke, has come out in the repair, that in the interior of the I-Phone missing a number of screws and covers, which is why a repair is rejected by Apple. My contact with the seller has only standardized answers with catastrophic spelling , since then, the seller does not announce anymore. Of a purchase is absolutely not recommended !!!	0
It lacked the detailed German manual. I have politely requested her but so far without success. My worst Amazon order. HP	0
Is not usable after 2 years .... listening to music is no longer possible / charge is difficult.	0
The iPhone 7 was purchased on 06.11.2017, since four days is now the battery is broken! There is only one Portuguese customer service TeleNr.	0
Wanted to dub old numbers on new I Phone, hotline a disaster. Two employees did not work, the third then knew. Five hours on the phone, a horror. The hotline does not work.	0
Positive foil from the box was torn-The box in which the mobile phone was, was original, but wrongly put on each other. This means that if you had the package with the motive in front of you and turned it over, the writing was over your head. What did not seem so serious to me. Mobile initially worked great, but eventually showed no screen (black screen). Mobile phone was still active, but you could not operate it anymore. -> possibly display broken, although it is "" new ""	0
Unfortunately, very poor sound quality. For Apple, a descent. I have problems with my interlocutor who understands me very badly or not at all. Seems Apple does not register.	0
I wanted to get my age rather mature iPhone 4s replace a newer model. Since I use a MacBook to work with the usual compatibility among the devices was very important. So a new iPhone had to come from. Meanwhile, I use the new phone for about 4 months. Positive: -optimal display size-Touch ID is very handy for unlocking the screen-waterproof housing-a pretty good camera-the system runs very fast (although the difference to 4s but not so enormous is as I have imagined) Negative: -GPS is quite inaccurate (seems to be a known problem of the 7 models) -Akka performance is not optimal. After 2 days not so intensive use (GPS, e-mail / write, surf, phone) the battery is quickly empty. Unfortunately, this is not enough for me, considering that these are standard applications and not resource-hungry games. Unfortunately, older headphones can only be connected via an adapter. Conclusion: With the iPhone 7, you get a modern but extremely overpriced device, that with scores some features but also has some weaknesses. As far as the price performance is concerned, the cell phone did not convince me. Although I can understand that one pays the brand name here. But with the price level you expect something more. And the difference to an older model like the 4s (built in 2012) is not that huge. If you are not dependent on Apple products and do not necessarily need a mobile phone as a status symbol, you will be better off with much cheaper Android phones. # Update 2018 #After over 1.5 years, the phone is completely greased. The display simply went off, since then failed all revival attempts. According to the report, there is a hardware defect. Something I did not expect Apple device now! The Amazon Marketplace seller CVV is no longer responsive after the return. The money is gone!	0
After the update to iOS 11, the phone barely works. The screen freezes constantly. Apps crash. Battery empty much faster	0
This is my last iPhone since Generation 4's loyal customer! Why? For me, the iPhone has always been a "state of the art" product far beyond the competition, Jobs put a lot of passion in the development of devices next to a status symbol perfection In the point of quality and customer service was clearly noticeable in the first iPhones that this is a premium product. But with Generation 6, I noticed clearly that simply no lifeblood is in the development of the device, camera lenses that "slip" "and allegedly not a reason for complaint are ... just as the service of me hard on technology manufacturer of discounter reminiscent. Positive thinking, but I have decided for the 7, in the hope that it is a mature 6er (because optically has changed nothing), but I already regretted that after a very short time: / Yes the device brings innovations in comparison to the 6 series: - a button that is no longer a button- Forcetouch- Faster processor (who notices it, I do not) - better camera (I notice only in very faint pictures) For it likes to hang up for a few seconds, which I had previously experienced on any iPhone. Sometimes it has also simply do not feel like talking on the phone, and then with "" Call Failed "" word. In these situations, man can enjoy the silence of life, because without the one notices it (network is connected normally), callers are as busy / or unavailable signaled, without which you can even note it. If that was not enough, has my wife, who bought the same device in a different color at the same time, the same Probleme.Für me is the "" fun "" iPhone by the end of next year to extend the contract. Because it no longer embodies what it once was and the competition has not overslept the last 5 years, here was tightened and there are now significantly cheaper devices available that are similarly powerful .... but you pay not here for the name or the bad Kundenservice.Zur rating: I rate here with 2 stars because I product and price link together. Hot, for 250 ¬ I would give 4 stars, because it is simply a "" standard smartphone "" is. At a price of about 1000 €, however, I expect premium and the device is in no wise fair. If my recession has helped you in the product, I would be happy about a "" thumbs up "".	0
After almost a year now, I can finally explain myself able to write a reasonable review of the iPhone 7. It will certainly give some text. First: After my initial dislike of Apple years ago, I realized at some point that the products essential cleaner and problem-free than any other device on the market. For years I was very satisfied with my Apple devices. As far as the iPhone is concerned, I've never been so disappointed with an iPhone. I have had so many IPhones among all IOS versions but the iPhone 7 is a real disaster. Not because of some nonsense because of no jack connection, etc. --- People will move with the times and if you do not want it then just do not buy it. One also moves into an expensive apartment that you do not like and then just moans around. --- The problem is not even the hardware but definitely the software. From Apple, I've always been used to holding a product in my hands, which is fully mature. Meanwhile, this is far from the case. I own the iPhone 7 in rose gold with 128GB of memory, which is already an exchange product from Apple - but unfortunately also has the same Fehler.Zu beginning: I never had problems with Finding of mobile network etc. The sound is very nice, the display of the display is clean and pleasant, and the camera works perfectly - all things I can expect for as much money as I think. Now to the mistakes that Over time, I'm getting more and more annoyed and force myself to hard-reset the iphon almost every day. The IPhone had problems with Bluetooth from the start. Sometimes it connects, sometimes not (with different devices mind you). If you're lucky, there is a perfect connection, if not you have crashes every second and may be at the car radio, for example. Look forward to music that sounds only every second second. Both my first (purchased from release), as well as the exchange device makes (t) en this problem. Then: Unexpected snagging so that no action is possible for a minute. Neither display nor buttons react then. Also: Constantly crashing the most diverse apps. Some do not even start anymore. The battery runs incredibly fast even though it is not old and should actually last longer than before (I'm not a cell phone user and have a normal daily use - sometimes a WhatsApp message, sometimes Googling, sometimes on the Watch calendars or weather and occasionally write notes - depending on the day sometimes more and less use but not exaggerated) - Well the battery sometimes does not even hold until the evening and although I volllade.Updates lately also made without as of I'm set to hang on the charger?! Insufficient accuracy and function of the display ... and since the last IOS update constantly problems with the synchronization of emails (and as I said, it is far from my first iPhone, the usual setup errors or connection errors I exclude confidently) I have to get rid of how frustrating that is. I'm glad when I get my iphone 7 finally going on. Wait for the keynote from Apple to the iPhone 8. If I should like it and the budget does not blow up (which I assume, however) I will upgrade. If not, I'll downgrade and get a 6s, 6s or 5s again, which would be much better. Too bad I never thought I'd ever be able to give an Apple product only 2 stars. But there I have to stay objective, that is simply an impertinence I was never used to from Apple. I hope there will be a lot of improvement with the next models.	0
The proximity sensor has failed sporadically. It was really annoying. Constantly presses any buttons when talking on the phone. I was then a few times at the Apple Store. The people are super nice and very competent. First, we tried to just re-set the phone without backup. Unfortunately without success. After that they changed the complete display within 2 hours !! Now it works fine. Buy it in the Apple Store. There you will be helped. They also help with setting up and everything.	0
Because I do not think that's right, the sales tax was not included in the price. I would not have bought the product with such suspicious conditions. Of course, legally everything is constructed correctly, because after a short "trial period" "I do not keep the iPhone, that is sell, I will suffer great losses here.	0
In no case you should order here! The trouble is inevitable. I have tried to order an iPhone through two different providers three times, but every time there was no phone in the package !!!	0
I also ordered the iPhone 7 through the provider Topprice 24 and read with horror in many reviews that the phone was missing in the package. That was too risky for me then. Then I canceled the phone, which unfortunately did not work. Therefore, I will refuse to accept tomorrow. I take the 1-star rating because I like all interested buyers u.U. Give a good tip: If you order the phone, it should be unpacked in the BEISEIN the delivery. This one is then insured, the content should be missing and you have no circumstances with a refund. To Iphon itself: class. I bought it today in the store and am thrilled.	0
My wife has been using an iPhone 3GS so far and was very happy with it. After a few days of falling, the disc splintered, I thought it was time to treat her to a new smartphone. After a short discussion about the requirement profile, we decided on the iPhone 7, because according to various tests and user opinions it should have a better reception than the 5 or 6. (We can judge the comparatively bad reception performance of these devices quite well, since I have only the 5 and now use the 6) The delivery was Amazon-typical fast and easy, the look and feel of the new iPhone is perfect, the installation - as Apple usual - unproblematic and schnell.Aber then unfortunately the disillusionment came. We live on the Land and have gotten used to having a less than optimal network reception (whether D1, D2 ...). With the 3GS, my wife was able to make calls anywhere in the house and on the property without problems, with the new 7 Series this was no longer possible. Either looking for a position on the window, then there not move as possible or renounce on the phone ... both are not really useful alternative, if you have to use the phone for work almost continuously. Since my wife is also traveling a lot in rural areas, so anyway often has to struggle with weak network coverage, the iPhone 7 is unfortunately unusable for their purpose of use. What good is the ease of setup, the trouble-free networking with Outlook, the appointment coordination in the company or other gimmicks, if the rudimentary basic functions are not usable? For me it is incomprehensible that Apple does not manage it over device generations to get back an acceptable reception performance. Other manufacturers have the issue under control better and it just annoying when everyone around one can easily make phone calls or send messages and you sit with his noble phone on the dry ... Since phone in my opinion, still the essential function of a basic Is mobile phones, I can not award more than a star despite all the other positive features of this device, especially since Apple apparently this problem does not take seriously for years seriously! The iPhone 7 goes back to Amazon and the old 3 Series is repaired.	0
I'm totally disappointed, the phone was not included. The packaging from Amazon was not damaged. The foil of the mobile phone packaging had been opened and the phone was removed. Very sad !!!!	0
The worst and most criminal monopoly in the world, who have no respect for their customers. IPhone 7 + 128 gb, in the beginning everything was great, until I realized that the microphone was not working properly. No problem I thought, sent in and the service announces the display was broken and I would have to pay 200 € for a new one. It was a small scratch that did not bother me, I told you that I want a new microphone and no new display. Refused, sent back! Then to the store, spent the whole day there, who said they would like to do it but they have a lock on it that they could not do anything. So again called service and clarify the final, they are stubborn and do not want to swap my microphone. Man has to imagine that, you have an 800 ¬ expensive phone with which you can not call! The bad thing is you do not care about the customer. I have 4 Apple products and they do not think I can offer a solution. I also told you nicely that I will no longer use Apple and disconnect me from it. Thereupon some sarcastic remarks. So man loses customers. That was the last time I buy such items. I am now standing there with a cell phone that I can not tel. Apple does not care that a bit. I advise everyone to buy any device that is worth nothing to the customer!	0
that's really the last thing. When opening the Amazon packaging noticed that the original film from the Apple box was open. When I opened the box I knew why ....... THE IPHONE 7 MISSED.	0
Very poor quality, system is constantly hanging !!!! Unfortunately, I am very dissatisfied, this phone would not order again. Kind regards	0
I ordered the iPhone here solely because of the price in the hope of it cheaper than other vendors to get to my regret came the order ZUSPÄT and incomplete with me in the box was no cell phone in it only headphones the charger and the adapter for the "" headphone jack	0
Unfortunately, little innovation. The fact that you can no longer paden the battery at the same time and listen to music with headphones is just as much a joke as the homebutton, which no longer recognizes moisture or light dirt on the finger and thus unlocks only after five failed Versucgen. So nothing for craftsmen or people who like to bathe. The third joke is the supposedly sapphire crystal, which of course is none. The iPhone has dropped me twice from low altitude and twice the display has jumped. Too bad.	0
Terrible! Have the iPhone for almost a month now. After a week appeared in the front camera purple stripes and immediately after it crashes! Have it now 2 times sent to Apple and receive only in response we can not find the error! Never again!	0
Bo Ey how ugly !!!! People the eggshell can never hold the water on a Samsung S8. Never! What a spongy display. Photos do not have 4K quality. If you sit on the trash turns through. Then you are only spied out with Eiertunes. Ridiculous in order to load music onto the gurkophone, this is only possible with Eiertunes. Ridiculous !!!! The warranty of 1 year is also underground. Anyone who supports child labor here is sorry for me. For 1 million euro, I would buy no Eierphone. Since Samsung is 1000 times better in quality and service.IgitigitEIERPHONE NO THANKS	0
I got the iPhone 7 in diamond black and was also enthusiastic about the design, but come after almost every little touch fine scratches to .. Use it now only a week even with a shell and the Iphone has a lot of scratches on the back. Not recommended had many Iphones before and none of them had only a scratch. disappointed	0
So the only positive: Good system and liquid Ablauf.Negatives: Price / performance is right Nothing support is not thought out-> is your phone broken or it is no longer on, sends you the support a confirmation code on the phone, so that further steps can be initiated , But the phone is broken and then how do you have this confirmation code have not at all.You have to go to an Aplle Store suburb, wait several hours and then come the next day with an appointment. Well, we all have enough free time for it? Take care that the battery NEVER gets really empty. Why? Yes that happened to me twice and 3 of my friends too. If you do not power the smartphone within the next 30min it is DEEP DOWNLOAD, well with everyone it is different, my colleague had it on stream 14h so it showed signs of life again has at the other about 20h and with me even over 35h. now 35h without a cell phone where everything is stored inside and you can reach without replacement cell phone anyone is shit! FOR A SMARTPHONE THAT HIGH CALIBERS SHOULD HAVE MAXIMUM 1-2 HOURS OF DURATION AND NOT DAMAGED 2 DAYS. The same happened to me Iphone 6 and I have directly bought an IPHONE 7 and lo and behold, the same problem. As if that were not enough, they arrive with their stupid safety. One can use his Apple ID nirgens because the whole time want to somehow code what was sent on the defect device. You will not get an appointment online without a ID in this store. My tip: do you buy this, never let the battery go empty, and buy iphone 6, because there is not a big unteschied. I used both and wasted money unnecessarily.	0
Oh man ... Apple. Every year a new iPhone, but never 1 year with a technical revolution. The iPhone 6 had an HD display for the first time, at a time when other manufacturers like Sony have already worked on 4K Panel. I really liked the design back then. An iPhone, which consists entirely of aluminum, except the front, was a house number. Only the antenna strips ... what are they for? LG does not need something like that, Sony does not need something like that, even Samsung did not need something up to the S5 and it does not look good either. So there was a lot that Apple could have improved on the iPhone 7. Now it's here! And it's a huge disappointment. I do not expect a revolutionary smartphone every year, but the iPhone 7 has nothing new to offer that other companies have not had. The display once again resolves to 1280x750p. In addition, it is as usual only 4.7 inches tall. Since the sharpness has not changed. What was improved are the colors, but I liked the iPhone 6 very well. But by the fact that Apple made the colors again more intense, the display of the iPhone 7 seems oversaturated. Similar to the Samsung Galaxy S4. Black and white balance against alright. Especially white has succeeded. But the colors are too thick. As for the pixels, you can not compare it to a Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which I tested at the IFA and has the best display on offer. The panel of the iPhone 7 is pixelated and out of focus. Even the Galaxy S3 convinces thanks to the S-AMOLED technology in spite of lower resolution more than the iPhone 7 In terms of processing and design Apple was already in first place and the word "" was "" applies today, because the design like not me at all. Hardly a trace that it is the 8th (?) Generation. From the front, it is identical to the iPhone 6s and only the rear is a difference noticeable. The antenna strips have now been moved upwards to get a nicer back. But it does not look much better than its predecessor. But a nice selection has been added, because you can now choose between matte black and piano black and both looks classy. The battery is typically not changeable Apple and the memory expansion is missing as always. There are now 32, 128 and 256GB available. The SD card slot is missing as with any Apple iPhone. But at 256GB you need no Speichererweiterung.Der battery has a capacity of 1960 mAh, which sounds like extremely little and is so. I was allowed to test the iPhone 7 so far 1 week and in these 7 days I had to charge the smartphone 10x. And that's just too much.When the device came back to me, I had to charge it twice the next day! Example: For the Huawei P9, I only had to load 1x the next time and then every 2-3 days. And after the battery life was fully utilized, it kept half a day of moderate use. Honestly, at not even 2000 mAh, I expected no other result. The main camera resolves with 12MP. The pictures in daylight excellent. Sharpness, color, dynamic range ... everything really top. In dim light, the images become blurred and there are fewer details that turn into image graining in the dark. However, the pictures are still usable at night. To the camera of the Samsung Galaxy S7 does not approach the iPhone. The video recordings are in spite of image stabilization z.T. very shaky and in videos also grain in shadow corners is minimal recognizable. The microphone, which automatically activates video, is a disaster. Noise, sometimes too bright, sometimes too dull. Bass does not exist at all and a slight crack is heard in minimal wind. Apple advertises the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with the hitherto fastest smartphone. Of course, only since the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was taken out of the sale due to explosion hazard. And I have to say that I really like the performance here. Apps start and close almost in record time. In addition, iOS 10 once again tidier. At least I barely discovered Bloadware. Very good Apple! Generally, the performance is the best you can find on the iPhone 7. Unfortunately, the device gets hot relatively quickly, so often the camera is not activated. But fortunately this is very rare auf.A special features are not so much. 3D touch, fingerprint sensor and 3.5mm jack plug removed. For this, Apple has included headphones with cables, but with an adapter to plug them into the USB C port. Sounds contradictory and it is like that. It seems to me that Apple itself does not believe in their Bluetooth headphones.3D Touch works the same way as the iPhone 6s, but I never used 3D Touch. In addition, the iPhone 7 IP67 certified, so protected against dust and water. In the test, the waterproof worked well, but this feature is also not new. In conclusion, the iPhone 7 is not a really good smartphone. It has positive things like the big memory, the waterproof and the great performance, but the battery is not good and the display for the year 2016 is too pixelated. But I think that iPhone 7 Plus can do better. And if the imense price of more than 1000 € for the 256 GB version was even lower, the iPhone 7 would still have earned 3 stars. But that leaves 2 stars left.	0
As already mentioned, I have purple stripes on the pictures I'm doing. I have sent the phone to Apple and have been waiting for my iPhone for 2 months now. I will prefer to buy another model or a completely different mobile phone. Never again!!	0
Hello, please need a bill for insurance mfgDa my mobile kapput ist.mein disply is to renew. Thanks mfg glösl	0
The phone is of the equipment really good, unfortunately it can take thanks to the high SAR values ​​nowhere with, unless you buy this stupid Strahlenbumpper. I brought out my iPhone 6 again for the first time and I hope that the error on the next iPhone will be fixed.	0
I travel a lot for work and talk a lot. Since the "" Upgrade "" on iPhone 7, it is at some point always a fight between quickly reload and phone. Bluetooth handsfree would be a possibility, but not in the well-known headphone quality. With the headphones, the phone call is so pleasant that the called often does not even hear that I'm in the car. Thus, for professional frequent travelers - and not suitable Telefon.Update - after one year in use, the battery hardly an hour. No wonder, Apple simply turns off disabled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Even if you make it out. Ridiculous.	0
Do not want to give much, never write reviews. But no aux for that the speakers should be so good? The 6s are just as good that's just ridiculous. The Jet Black can barely touch man without it being greasy and gets at The homebotton does not always work when man has a little rougher fingers. All in all: nothing better than 6s rather less so I am back and if the next should be such a garbage then samsung after 3. iPhone :)	0
Really laughable Handy.Powerbutton defective after a few weeks.Teleefonie only by loudspeaker möglich.Langsames operating system.Akkulaufzeit in the best case a few hours.Total overpricedWho today really Apple still attacks, which is not to help.	0
Unfortunately, there is no 3.5 jack plug !!!! Since I hear a lot of music and have to charge at the same time, this phone is useless !!!!!!! Otherwise it is good but I do not know what drove in the minds of the developer of this phone is not to install a headphone jack ????????????? Only for reasons of space ??? Actually a reason to switch to another platform !!!!!!!! Better 2 mm thicker but longer battery life and a headphone jack !!!!!!!!!!!!!! What did they think ??????????????????????	0
I will not buy. SAR value too high. 1.38W / kg ... Almost every other manufacturer reaches values ​​below 1W / kg and then too expensive	0
I even had one in my hand it is simply exaggeratedly expensive apple exaggerates with the price of such a dirt Iphone where you can not even expand the memory with a microSD card are the 722 ¬ way too much really not worth it !!!	0
Never again iphone! Stay away from iphone !!! did not buy it from here but it is the last dirt I know. Do not do that. You better buy an Android phone or Samsung and you will be satisfied.	0
Is his money ABSOLUTELY !!! not worth! Not better than good Android devices. Have now an S7 .... absolutely great and at least as good!	0
Frightening how cheap the new iPhone 7 looks like. Not to mention the design, which looks rather old-fashioned, and for that price. But every day a stupid person gets up.	0
Apple is and will remain the world's most expensive scrap in the trash, regret having bought this scrap, I'm staying with my Samsung, Apple scrap will be sent back	0
I bought this iphone and immediately it was not working, upon a contact with the seller, he exchanged for another new one.  That one had faulty speakers and I went to apple for warranty, they changed the whole front panel.  Few months later I noticed that speakers were again down and went to apple again, this time apple exchanged for the whole new iphone, which again did not work from the start but unfortunately one year warranty by Apple expired.EU directive imposed a two-year warranty period in the EU and if if manufacturers warranty is limited to one year, the seller should be responsible.  This iphone is a bit older that a year, I tried to contact the seller few times, Amazon customer services contacted seller twice, this seller ignore all.I will have to deal with Amazon now, because it is set by law that there is a two year warranty for products sold in the EU, especially for such costly ones.As for apple... I somehow think that minor retail shops get unsuccessful batches of apple products (lets say the ones that apple cannot expect for sure that all the manufacturing conditions have been fulfilled in a full form).This is my first problem with apple products among iphones, ipads and macbooks but I also never bought before through internet.  I guess not worth it!	0
The phone was broken from the beginning. Neither do I understand, nor can I really understand people on the phone. Even playing voice messages is almost impossible without headphones	0
Have marketplace as a used device "" like new "" bought. After 15 months it turns out at a pending display repair, the device has ever gotten a new display. Because the attachment was damaged, repair is no longer possible. Under "like new" I understand something else. A pity, that's untrustworthy.	0
The iPhone 7 is perfect in my view - except for a trifle: phoning does not work. According to my research on the internet, it turns out that some (maybe a batch) has catastrophic voice quality. I am not to be understood in the approach for my interlocutor. Noise, background noise, choppy, etc. The seller, I have been written several times> no answer. The iPhone 7 is therefore a gamble. It may be that you are lucky and get a usable model. One thing I can say but: with this provider, there is no service. Not even an answer!	0
My review is limited to IOS 11.I want and can not understand what this unnecessary management of wireless and Bluetooth connections should be in the control center, if I want to turn off the connection to my Wi-Fi hotspot, then I want the connection completely interrupted and not something between. I do not want to have to navigate in the settings for each time to then turn off the wireless or Bluetooth module, why Apple says that everyone who owns an iPhone, even in possession of an Apple Watch, Instant Hotspot or superfluous styleless Apple Pencil is for which that functionality was introduced in the control center.	0
Unfortunately, I had the same problem as another writer. The used cell phone itself was in good condition and with complete accessories. However, the phone is produced for England and does not work in Germany. This was not mentioned in the device description. It is also the Apple Store not possible to switch this device for Germany. Schade.Viel running for nothing.	0
Actually, the iPhone 7 should replace my iPhone 4S. But unfortunately, nothing came of it. The device went back to Amazon today. Because of the miserable reception in the GSM area. (D2 network Vodafone with me). I live in an area with unfortunately weak mobile network expansion. Where I have with the 4S 2 reception bar, it fluctuates with the iPhone 7 between network search and 1 reception bar. Telephone calls without disconnection are unfortunately hardly possible with the iPhone 7 here. After more than 1 hour of extensive consultation and some checks with the Apple Support, the recommendation was made to send the device back. Since the technical checks of the support could not detect a fault with the device, it seems A reception increase by future software updates is unlikely and I can not guarantee synonymous Apple, so returns. In areas with weak network expansion, I can not recommend the iPhone 7! Where a good network expansion It may work. I have now ordered a 6S, which, according to Apple Support, should not have the problems.	0
I forgive a star for the delivery. The device could not be put into operation because it was supplied with the SIM Lock contrary to the description. The Apple Support could not help me, I should contact the network operator. In addition, no VAT could be issued for the goods - overall, I strongly advise against buying!	0
Got the iPhone as a service phone. And I do not like it at all. All very awkward.- no back button- I can only use my good headphones when I carry the adapter along.- I also have the new MacBook Pro and Apple was seriously so unable to give any way to charge the iPhone on the Mac, ios: - Terrible zero-customizable keyboard with bad auto-correctionWhen you have multiple messages from one person, they will all be displayed one at a time on the lock screen and block them- Notifications can not be removed easily with a short swipe icon can not be positioned at will on the home screen - the widgets are a joke	0
Unfortunately miserable call quality (synonymous with the other party, only no problem if both sides use a headset ...), great for apps. Looks good.	0
When today the package arrived with me, I was happy as a small child. However, this joy did not last long. Because in my package, although the whole accessory was ONLY NO IPHONE !!!!!! AMAZON, YOU WANT TO TRANSFER TO ME ONLY I AM ON 180.	0
Does one have to have the device, if one does not get it just officially made available? The new waterproofness, the increased computing power, the better camera, the larger memory are conceivable reasons for purchase. Who decides on the device, the film Belkin ScreenForce InvisiGlass screen protector (suitable for iPhone 7), which is perfectly centered in the Apple store, and the case Apple MMW82ZM / A iPhone 7 Silicone Case black for protection and preservation of value recommended (see photo), so he gets rid of it in good time before the iPhone 8 at a good price. In the telephony Apple has lost the connection to the top. The so-called SAR value, which indicates the specific absorption rate of mobile phone radiation in watts per kilogram of body tissue, positions the iPhone 7 virtually as the tail light of the competitor field. The SAR reading of the iPhone 7 is still a factor of 1.4 from the limit of 2 W / kg with 1.38 W / kg, but in fact six times as high as some competing models, almost a factor of 10 stay below the limit. Those who often need to make calls in places with poor mast coverage or good shielding will be inclined to wait for an improved iPhone 8 or higher. FAZIT Apple is a rational actor taking advantage of its opportunities. To blame them is therefore as pointless as criticizing a US president or a car brand because it produces polluting SUVs. Because it is always the little man who has set the course by his choice. So as long as consumers are so uncritical about their favorite brands and with rather inconsequential innovations, which are commonly referred to as product care, cheer with 4- and 5-star reviews as in the sports palace, instead of just waiting for the next or next version it will continue for a long time. Also to the detriment of the environment, which is mainly burdened by the production of unnecessary electronics. A high-quality, elaborately produced electronic device, which one can not operate satisfied and with good conscience for some years, but because of its shortcomings better one sees the first best opportunity to get each newer, is a sacrilege. My favorite brand Apple has less to be ashamed of than its uncritical customers.	0
If you could express the word police state with a cell phone, it would be the iPhone 7. As usual Apple not many customization options. A fingerprint sensor, and to the blast and probably the biggest selling point on the phone: A home button where you can set the minimum fineness, woow! What a senseless hipster shit. I would knock this drecks cell phone in the bin, if it were not my company phone ... The missing AUX connection is a joke. You need the annoying iTunes on the PC to download music to the phone. The power is supplied by something you once again only found in Apple, which is why it is not so easy to borrow from a colleague the charging cable. The phone does not seem very sturdy.	0
Switched from samsung 6 edge to iphone 7. Unfortunately I am not satisfied. Never again iphone! -Display resolution is my zugering -Wlan and Bluetooth can only switch off in the setting.-Android as the operating system is much better than ios.-4.7 inches is no longer up to date. And Plus was way too big. -Very expensive-iphone update policy. Phones are slowing down. I'm sorry but never again iphone! Never again apple	0
Well, I'm doing it very briefly. I'm in principle very convinced by Apple and I'm not deterred by the lack of headphone jack. It would in principle be a great smartphone + chic design + battery is ok (could be bigger but is enough) + great performance + iCloud and iTunes Convenience + feel engine and 3D touch complete the whole very good as far as 5 stars from me Now come the problems that raises the iPhone with which I honestly did not expect.- 1 star due to the price. I knew that and I expected that, but the purchase still hurts. Unfortunately, my old iPhone was broken unexpectedly, so I needed a new one and thought then I want a "" current "" device. If you then informed and the high-end smartphones of the competition looks like with similar (some better) features for half of the price offered you have to swallow-1 star because of the problematic sound quality ... The adapter ensures losses in the Sound quality and Bluetooth is unfortunately not implemented as you would expect, especially from Apple. Bluetooth is fine with the Bose system. Before that it did not matter because Aux was always available. Now you need a good wireless connection. Unfortunately, e.g. not a decent Bluetooth Aux find adapter, since Apple does not support the apTX standard (Bluetooth in CD quality!) - 1 star deduction because of the high radiation value, I have read randomly online. The radiation value is in the cell phone is well above the values ​​of the competition, Partial Factor 4! Apple himself says you should not hold the device to the head ... More you have to say at this point I think I do not think I'll sell it and get me a 6S or something. Maybe I also dare to jump to Android. Mainly because of the audio quality :(	0
Well, what can I say, I'm really disappointed. As much as I love Apple and like to pay the money. I have a lot of devices from Apple in use and had in the past pretty much every iPhone. Most of the time I ordered it right after the keynote, because I never really could wait and it was well worth it. But since the release of the iPhone 6S, Apple has left something to be desired as far as the iPhone is concerned. I try that - just in terms of the iPhone 7 to justify something. Maybe some people think about that instead of throwing their money out the window ... 1. Less and less novelties - but always more expensive Somehow, nothing more really happens at Apple. as far as the iPhone is concerned. Not just visually, but generally. Apple presents things and argues with things that other manufacturers have long since, where this is already standard. For example the thing with IP67 and things like that. Somehow nothing is doing more - and I think that's a pity. Because there was a time, there it was still very different ... Especially in times of Steve Jobs, RIP. I do not know, I would just wish that I get more for my money than the whole 0815 crap. Do not misunderstand, technically the iPhone is, especially now with the 7, of course, top and there is nothing to complain about it. But does all that really justify such an enormous price of over 1000 euros? No.2. Always bigger, but why the hell no 4-inch version anymore? What I do not like is the growing size! I'm one of many who do not want to carry a brick with them. I prefer the 4 "variant, which was the reason to switch from the iPhone 6S to the iPhone SE again - which makes me very grateful that Apple has released this" special edition ". So, why the hell again only a 4.7 and 5.5 inches version? Why bring an alternative to the big models back on the market, if you destroy them directly at the release of the new generation? What kind of sense does it make? There are many like me who would prefer the 4 "version - you could clearly see on the iPhone SE. For me that's why the 7 Series is not for me in question, much I prefer keeping my iPhone SE.3. Different features to the "" brick "" (Plus model) What should actually this crap with the different features in the models? Why has only the plus the 2nd Camera Lens from the telephoto lens? That's just the whole people fooled. As if this feature could not be included in the 4.7 "version. You do not understand, for all love.The Plus model is really nothing, the part is too big. Even had the iPhone 6S Plus - put it in your pocket in summer when you're wearing shorts. No, just no. Alone half the tablet to hold the phone to the ear, 188g heavy ... No, again no. Nothing for me ... (matter of taste, no question ...) 4. Same design, old technology, where is the innovation?! I always smile when I look at the Apple Keynote on the iPhone. People are blinded by such massive improvements, especially compared to older models. More speed, better CPU / GPU blah blah ... What itches me! Anyone who already knows an iPhone knows exactly that they always run fluffy and never hang! I have never noticed a really noticeable difference. Benchmark back and forth - it does not itch me anything, because you hardly notice it anyway, if you use it just as normal. Camera is the only thing that happens every now and then, if only minimally. But instead of finally integrating this ugly camera lens into the (!) Case, no, they remove the 3.5mm jack connector and only offer Lightning. It does not seem to matter that you can not charge iPhone 7 AND listen to music at the same time. Since you have to (no, you should) just for a sleazy 170.- Euro buy the new wireless headphones ... Yes no, is clear! Back to the camera lens, which still stands out the back, which in my opinion would be really better to solve (other manufacturers manage it): The only reason why the iPhone has not been thinner and slimmer so far, were 2 reasons: The 3, 5mm jack connection as well as the theme of robustness. NOW, I'm curious to see if there's something new next year and Apple finally gets the turn again - or if the scrape really goes on like the last years. I mean hey, that the jack-connection fell off I really do not care, but I want the iPhone compact, thinner, smaller and without a protruding camera lens, so you can put it on the table, without having to use a shell MUESS.The annoying! -Fact is, I will pay no Euro for the iPhone 7, if, then only at contract renewal, I should then get it for free. Because I'm not ready to pay so much money for such a crap. Please do not get me wrong, it may be technically top, no question. But I'm just concerned that people are blinded with tiny things and everyone thinks they have to have that, just because it's the newest iPhone. That in the 7er, however, to 50% the same hardware as in the 6S, nobody seems to bother. That's just not worth the money! One can argue about the size of the memory, I've always found this an impudence from Apple, but it has always been like that. At least they have now finally adopted the 16GB variant, which was really no longer timely. Because after iOS 9 or 10 were already 4-6 GB occupied, so you would like to have just under 10 GB for your own use. But that's a different story, where everyone has to decide for themselves, which one of the storage is ultimately worth or how much you need. I keep my iPhone SE for now, see no reason to pay the significant extra price, only to my neighbors, friends and acquaintances to show that I have the latest iPhone 7, so they all envy me so much. Find it a pity, especially since I take a lot of pictures and movies, I would have liked the new features of the camera - but not under these "circumstances". Who has the money, please. Loss of value at Apple is thank God very low, so that at any time an Apple iPhone can always sell well. The fact that some are currently offered back on eBay for over 1700, - Euro, just because you have to wait on Apple shows once again just the profit greed of the people ... Apple iPhone 7, how should I love you, you have really disappointed me , driven me away from you, you are indeed really chic, otherwise not wrong, but what you offer me now, it is not worthy to me. In my opinion, save the money and keep the iPhone 6S / SE, is just as good. But this is just my personal objective opinion, based on experience and facts.	0
Solid processed, IOS alright, even if not as stable as ever, battery lasts surprisingly long.Display resolution in contrast to the competition in this price segment a disaster. Please test the display, watch YouTube videos on this device and compares the resolution and then decide even before you pay so much money.	0
I have been a big fan of Apple's iPhones since iPhone 4. My last iPhone was an iPhone 6, which I gave away about a month ago, because I received the new iPhone 7 in 256 GB with a new mobile phone contract. For all iPhone 6 converters: the switch is not really worthwhile. The camera is marginally better, the processor is probably faster, but in practice you notice nothing of it. The only other change: the missing headphone jack. This is not an improvement, but a total failure! I think about it every day about the iPhone 7 exchange. The battery lasts a day very difficult. Most of the time I have to recharge during the day. However, this leads to the fact that I always have to take a break when using, so that I can recharge. I talk a lot, listen to music or watch videos from time to time. Then I have to stop in the middle of everything and start charging the phone, because the iPhone does not last the day (with normal use). Really great is the case of calls, where I must either put on speaker or the phone must always hold my ear, because I can not use a headset when charging .. Of course, you could buy an adapter, but is that really useful ?. The provider makes the phones expensive and leaves a connection away. To make up for this, you have to buy an adapter for a lot of money and carry it along permanently, as long as the Driite provider adapter works reliably, because Apple is very rigorous. It hardly has to upgrade iPhone 6 / 6s, but it has a huge disadvantage in everyday life so noticeable that you get the push, you would buy a cell phone for 30 ¬, in fact it is just under 1000 €. Apparently, Apple does not think about that ... I am definitely disappointed for the first time in a long time.	0
The iPhone is a nuisance: you can not charge at the same time and watch music or videos with headphones, because everything runs on the same access. If you want to shoot a longer video with external micro and has to recharge the battery or wants to use a power bank - bad luck! The transfer of mobile phone to PC does not work, you always have to use the iCloud, with many data you have to buy additional storage - a monthly amount I can not erase the backup of my old iPhone from the new iPhone, so it just shut off while filming. In addition, it is quickly hot when filming ... All in all, so just annoying, because you rely on the various software from Apple and this unfortunately only partially work. I really regret it very much to have bought. One plus: it looks very nice.	0
Not really water tight ... Was briefly in water pool .. Camera (jerk and front) was fogged. After opening, I have timely eliminated the water. Luck in bad luck.	0
The iPhone 7 has actually earned 4 to 5 stars, this has been written a lot. However, for me is also a good service for a € 870 mobile phone and Apple can no longer deliver. I had problems with my iPhone and went directly to the Apple service. The error could not be solved even after 3 complaints. The service seemed incompetent and dried up. Again and again, the same phrases of the employees used, without a solution to bring about. Consumer rights regarding the warranty for defects under German law were eroded and ignored. The Apple warranty is a priority, even if I would be better off under the warranty. This is very alarming, as a group over the law and law sets. As I was then more and more acidic by the ignorance of the concrete personnel, one has noticed correctly how the employees have the invisible arrogant "" Apple coat "" dressed and no longer argued goal-oriented. Granted, I was a little upset, too, but rightly so. I never became dropping, offensive or personal. With which arrogance but it has to do with a non-functioning 870 ¬ phone at Apple, is absurd and no longer of this world. By the way, was exactly this service at Apple a few years ago, still exemplary. Today, this is often sluggish and bureaucratized. If Apple does not change here soon with the amount of staff and especially well-trained (professional, non-religious;)) professionals, the case will probably deep in the medium to long term, because then lacks the backing in the fan base, the Apple still has today. One should hire more IT people in the service and no theologians;)	0
For nostalgics, the perfect phone determines because Apple is on the technical level of 5 years ago and you feel relegated back in time. For me almost unusable. Am really shocked at how bad apple is compared to my Huawei Mate9.	0
The feel may have improved, but everything else is miserable at this device. I prefer to stay with the iPhone 6, because you have at least a reasonable device.	0
I use the iPhone 7 for nearly three months now and have a first opinion about the device formed. Unfortunately, I have to say that the disadvantages predominiegen.Mir is incomprehensible how to use the camera of the iPhone 7 even as a start as well or with those The competitions in the dark or at night have an extreme noise, which can not be mitigated by the very limited setting options. In addition, the extreme restrictions and restraints which one submits to the use of an Apple product, for someone who previously an Android device was used, a nuisance. Contacts from the phone book can only be sent to other users of Apple products. When talking on the phone heats up extremely over the entire side of the holding the smartphone, the use of the headset is highly recommended and saves Kopfschmerzen.Ich received the device as a business phone which is why I do not care about the extremely overpriced inappropriate price. No doubt there are also two positive points. The finish and feel is definitely unique in the market and great.2. Apple gives the user a sense of security for their own data and while using Apps.Ich would get me no more iPhone, because you have more disadvantages than advantages in comparison to the competition.	0
1.34 watts SAR worth per kilogram of body weight ... great performance Apple! I wonder when that will finally be banned and consequences follow.	0
The Apple iphone 7 has a SAR value of 1.238 (W / kg) - absolutely healthy - especially for children, adolescents, heart patients or stressed managers. A nightmare. You should really only make phone calls via headphones. Predecessor models were already extremely borderline with SAR values ​​of 0.93 to 0.97 (w / kg). Laymen should inform themselves at the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (bfs.de) or consumer protection. Further technical innovations: In short "" Nothing new in the West "". Lots of money, lots of chi-chi, which you do not need. Each buyer should know that Apple pays almost no taxes on this product in Europe, while the production costs for this phone are around 20-40 €. In short asocial.	0
The iPhone 7 has now been delivered directly from Apple, but goes back again. It's brave to bring such a smartphone on the market and then not even available, statement in the Apple Store Hamburg Jugfernstieg, "" Since you have just daily from 6 clock watch online, if you can reserve one, we know not, when or which ones come "". And after this statement, the disinterested hip staff was already gone again. The iPhone 7 sounds audible, not only when you hold your ear directly, but also from a few centimeters away. The display has a slight yellow cast for me, does not look brighter than the 6s. The smartphone will be warm, even when it is not busy, in a software update even hot. The missing headphone jack is annoying, as previously assumed, the sound with adapter slightly worse. The included headphones have always been out of the question, who gets those things properly in the ears, the sound and the quality are miserable anyway. The display edges are still incomprehensible too large, Apple is giving away a larger display area. Battery life is bad as usual. In addition, the phone rattles like crazy when you tap lightly on the back or it touches in the upper part, loose parts? In 2016, I find only HD resolution and no fast charging cable too brave. It is outrageous Apple to offer a smartphone that is not available for sale and that has so many (quality) problems. Quite apart from the completely overpriced price, I therefore advise: Stay away. In addition, the fingerprint sensor also works miserably.	0
It is and remains a completely overpriced device. Pray that the device will never fail, you will be treated by Apple as Bitsteller.	0
Ridiculous device with little technology for a much overpriced price! Android smartphones have some of the "new" features for about 4 years :-D	0
i never used an iphon androit i also do not want the phone is way too expensive with 700e i can buy 7 phones this is not worth it i would never spend that much too bad my money would be thrown away	0
After 6 months, there is no possibility to call, the guarantee is a scam.	0
Unfortunately, it suddenly stopped ringing on calls. The iPhone 7 plus has only vibrated. Even the Apple Support could not help by phone. Therefore, the device went back.	0
The phone has been delivered quickly, but unfortunately it has a dead pixel error and that is very annoying because it was a Christmas present for my daughter	0
(Condition: Used - Like New, sim-lock-free, CONDITION: Technically flawless, visually NEW, absolutely no signs of wear. DELIVERY: cell phone, battery, charger, USB cable, instructions, OVP, please note that we are hygienic. ..)))) ... Several details, has a scratch in the lower right corner and I was not informed and in the box does not come headphones and comes a small cable, which I think corresponds to the iPhone, even the battery lasts very little and gets very hot when charging, the output of audio from the bottom is dirty and was not cleaned. Good that the phone works well.	0
Product is not new, but overhauled !!! Would not come with me original packaging, without original cable and power plug and without headphones on!	0
The cell phone still did not come. I do not want the phone anymore. I have already got the money back.	0
The iphone is great. The dealer rigenerati srl but not. He is not faithful. I had ordered a refurbished device. This should be delivered in 8 days. If such a device is offered, it is assumed that it is already at the dealer. After 8 days still no device. Dealer declares he has problems with his supplier ?! I needed the device urgently. Some e-mails written and also asked that they let me out of the contract, so I can get a replacement. This was granted only after the involvement of Amazon another 2 days later. Stay away from rigenerati srl !!!	0
Never again iPhone junk. I ordered an iPhone 7 Plus with 128gb, the phone arrived pretty quickly, but sent in a joke package from Amazon itself, as one would expect from a 900 ¬ article, cheap and in no way appropriate , I opened the packaging and had to notice that on the phone the minus button was pressed to adjust the volume and could not be pulled out. And with a brand new phone for 900 ¬, no idea how something with Apple comes through the final inspection. I sent it back immediately and I'm curious how it works with the refund. But the very best is coming first. I thought that somehow it could happen and ordered the same phone again. After a week, the article was delivered, however, since I was not at home, to the neighbors. When I picked up the package, also in the same lousy, cheap Amazon packaging in the evening, I immediately noticed that the box was open at the side. I opened it now on the zipper and on the Handykarton the protective foil was not any longer off, but lay crumpled beside it. After opening the cell phone box almost hit me to sleep, the accessories were completely available, but the phone was stolen from the box, was probably taken out of the side of the cheap packaging and put back after removing the phone. After several phone calls and e-mails with the Amazon Hotline I was told that Amazon does not replace the phone because they allegedly sent the article properly! I have turned my lawyer on and now things are going to court. So if you think Amazon would be a reputable store I have to teach unfortunately a better. I will continue to report	0
The device makes great pictures, it is certainly also very fast. Ultimately, it is for me a phone with email reception. And here is the problem. Every second call I hear Hello, hello I can not understand you !!! It does not matter if I have the device on my ear or make a call via the handsfree function. Sorry apple, the device is not useful for calling.	0
The iPhone works very well and works flawlessly. What I noticed, however: -The display scratched very fast without foil, I have never had a slide on my iPhone displays and never had to detect as many scratches as with the iPhone 7 Plus. With such an expensive device, I would have expected more inconsistency.-When talking on the phone, you always rip off some hair. The gap where the display is installed with the housing is so large that hang in my phone while my hair. (Very annoying and painful)	0
Unfortunately, the device was only usable with Vodafone, but I am a Telekom customer. Have the device sent back a month ago, but so far received no refund.	0
My personal opinion about the iPhone 7plus 128 GB results from the handling with the device. I was already disappointed in the unpacking, because the device, from the point of view, was clearly below my expectations. The device can not be used without SIM even! The next sobering point. A device for 900 ¬, which can not even activate via Wi-Fi and a SIM for the initial installation requires is already brazen.The reception was at the same location 2 bars (points) worse and instead of LTE, there was only 3G. Audio files from the PC could not be transferred to the iPhone because the phone is not recognized. A Syncronisation went only over iTunes Store at the PC. At the same time 3 albums have completely disappeared! The device has the very good and bright display and the decent sound via headphones, which unfortunately can only be connected via the cheap adapter. Simultaneous headphone operation and charging the battery does not work. The launcher can also be personalized by far not as in Android devices. The missing "" return "" button was the k.o. Argument, because you just push away apps but not really close. The device goes back. My first iPhone was sobering! Where does this hype come from?	0
I have now the iphone 7 plus for 1 week. It's fast and it works (as you would expect from Apple) just everything.BUT !!!! - A phone is actually there to talk on the phone, and that's 7 plus a disaster. I've never owned a phone with such bad call quality. Making phone calls is really no fun.	0
Since you buy for less than 1000 ¬ a cell phone and can not even use it immediately because you have to buy an opener so that you can reinsetzen his sim card! Is not there for a thousand euro handy !!!	0
I am longtime Apple user. Positive: Always the current IOS, current apps and clean running OS Negative: Already twice the camera module was exchanged with me. The color dissolves around the camera. Now the third time, Apple denies a defect and does not repair the camera. Now are replaced color parts in the camera and my 1000 ¬ Smartphone is broken.	0
I bought the part originalverpakt, broken microphone, I'm not to understand. Phone is picked up, new software and battery charged, back !! It gives the impression that I would be too stupid for such a thing. In the pure, microphone does not work, now even the speaker has a very bad sound, after 5 min. Tel. We the garbage extremely hot. Apple picks up the phone. The garbage is now with me for a week and will not be picked up! DPD.Laut Apple should I make it myself with the DPD when the come (without package number) .I think your Grüner will turn in his grave.Bie the first repair landed the device in Biefkasten without transfer, in a thing around 1000 ¬ probably normal. Work for eight years only with Appledinger. This Iphonemüll was the last purchase of an Apple product. The apple is not only bitten but also wormy !!!	0
No memory card slot, no headphone jack, small display, small battery. Has the design ever been revised? Just something for fanboys. Can nothing better than zb. a Huawei Mate 8 or 9. Absolutely ugly by design and only utopian in price. 500EUR alone you pay only for the name. Wait for the Mate 9 or Xiaomi Mi Mix.	0
Have my hands burned because the processor overheats. Such a kack. DO NOT BUY!!! SAMSUNG IS BETTER !!! K *** apple man!	0
Instead of the ordered iPhone 6s, I received an iPhone 6. On my request for exchange of the article I got the answer that the iPhone 6s is not available, although this was offered. The iPhone 6 could not be reduced in price, since the price for the iPhone 6s is higher, according to the provider. An impudence to offer an iPhone 6s & then to ship an iPhone 6 !!!	0
A new 6s was ordered, but I got a used cell phone from the USA. The SIM Tray (sim card slot) had a different color on the lock. The Handyakku has expanded after 6 months, like a yeast cake. This also damaged the mobile phone display. An incredible rip-off and impudence to offer something like that. Unfortunately there are no zero stars. It should be minus 5 stars. Buy absolutely not recommended.	0
After battery problems (running time not even 24 h at minimum use) the first 6s went back and was replaced by the one reviewed here. By chance, I noticed here a disagreement in the settings that startled me. I checked the warranty on the Apple homepage and found that it had already expired. A call to the Apple service line confirmed that fact, more than that, the warranty expired more than 2 years ago and the device was designed for the US market, making repairs extremely expensive and complicated. A complete sham package! I can only recommend to anyone here: Stay away from this seller! The phone itself would have been functional, the battery life but still under any criticism. I have an iPhone 7 now and am very satisfied with it.	0
It's the second attempt to get a working iPhone 6S in rose gold. Visually, everything is fine, but the microphone does not work, it can only record noise. When the first order the camera software was not in order, so only blurred images. With the first purchase, the refund worked smoothly. I'm curious if this is how it is this time. Just a pity that I did not come to a working cell phone. Because I do not do a third attempt.	0
The product was delivered without a charger. In addition, the charging of the cell phone does not work properly, also spins the battery and goes quickly empty. The Habdy is often easy and sometimes it has days where charging does not work at all. I contacted the seller two weeks ago and have not received any feedback until today. Very disappointed! Keep away from it.	0
The device was very scratched on all sides! The tracks suggest that it landed on the ground a few times. This device was used is clear, but so massive damage was not apparent from the description! I can only advise against a purchase!	0
Can not even rate the right article, because instead of that a normal iPone 6 was delivered. Was not a nice gift when it attracted attention. Decreased.	0
I bought an iPhone 6S 64gb as NEW in August 2018. After 2 months and a half the battery swelled up. I went to an apple certified repair store where they told me the warranty wouldn't cover the case because the Iphone had been activated more than 2 years ago and the screen was not even original apple.	0
it was written that the phone is in good condition unfortunately this was not the case. I would say that it is in an acceptable condition. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed that the large scratches on the back and slight scratches on the front were not mentioned.	0
Mobile was offered as a new product !!!!!! Ware came quickly. The box seemed original and was also welded - the phone showed no signs of use. 9 months after purchase failure due to swollen battery (case burst). According to Apple (Apple Store) is not new, since 2017 for the first time registered with Apple in the US, so the warranty is extinguished. In the context of customer satisfaction, Apple exchanges the phone for a surcharge of 50 € against a new device. I would avoid this seller. The phone itself is top! The behavior of Apple exemplary! the seller is a ......... !!!!!!!!	0
I bought two Iphone 6s within two years, and shortly after the 1 year warranty expired, they both gave up. The first after an update of the operating system. The second in an exam by Apple. Actually, only the battery should be changed, since the capacity showed only 85%. Function of the iPhone up to the diagnosis perfectly. So sent in and waited. After careful examination of the Apple technicians a defect of the motherboard was found. Cost of repair 330, - €! That at a time when Apple is no longer allowed to sell Iphone 7 and 8 in Germany and break the sales figures. A rogue who thinks bad things! The theme of Iphone 6s has done for me. Apple's quality was much better in the past. My old Iphone 4 and 5 are still doing their duty.	0
Unfortunately, the quality of Apple products has diminished. Have the phone in February d.J. bought u after not even four months, the battery is already broken. Too bad. Hope that Apple exchanges this for me on goodwill. But generally a problem with iPhone 6 u 6s seems to be.	0
I am very disappointed! Cannot recommend this product at all! Initially everything seemed perfect, the iPhone looked and felt new, battery worked properly etc. After 5 months the battery suddenly blew up within two days. For security reasons I stopped charging it. It was no more under warranty even though I bought it only 5 months ago. I brought it to a store, and they told me that some pieces haven’t even been original ones.Don’t buy this iPhone	0
The device was sold as new. Unfortunately, the battery change by a specialist turned out to be a used device. There was no glue between the display and the device, when opening loose screws fell out, the vibrato component was not in the designated place, it was not an original Apple display in the device etc .. This is clearly fraud and should not be tolerated under any circumstances: ((((	0
The iPhone lasts only a short time and shuts off at 11%. I will send it back!	0
I would not buy it from these dealers. My battery is not working anymore and the dealer is not responding or writing it was my problem and I would have to buy myself a new battery. I advise from here to buy something !!!	0
Unfortunately, you can not call the device simply (extremely poor connection quality). The battery life is also miserable. Did I really get a new device as ordered?	0
It was not new and not in original packaging. Headphones were completely missing. Not recommendable	0
Battery power drops by 5% per hour. And without using it somehow => if you do not charge it to 100% at bedtime, it turns off completely !!!	0

The cell phone was useless, all cards were locked	0
Unfortunately, the device was delivered broken and it was a lot of work to get his money refunded! Only possible through a guarantee request	0
Sold by J.K.WalteriPhone was described as overhauled, visually and technically flawless. Actually, the iPhone looked visually very good even after delivery. Due to a display break, the device had to be repaired shortly afterwards. Hereby it turned out that a cheap battery was installed. Well, OKSchlimmer is, however, that the seal was completely missing. Furthermore, various screws were loose in the device, a screw was not tightened and slid inside the case back and forth, which would have led to prolonged use quickly to a board damage. My daughter found in the headphones a used chewing gum! All this was in the "general overhaul" ignored, speak it was dilettantisch worked, the main thing is optics.	0
I received this great smartphone yesterday. Delivery worked really well and went really fast. Goods were in original packaging. Unfortunately I had to (not even) the first day notice that the battery is really bad. Have the phone this morning at 5:30 clock disconnected from the mains (fully charged). So far (11:30 am) I have only written a few messages. Background activities are all turned off or deactivated. My battery level is currently at 56% and that after only 6.5 hours (according to battery usage indicator allegedly 2h 6min use and 6h standby). I'll watch the whole thing first but it does not seem normal to me. Not with a new device ...	0
I use the apple devices since the 3gs generation. At first, getting used to the big screen took some getting used to, but then quickly turned positive. You do not need more to tell the phone, top gerät.Nachtrag, so 3 star deduction.The battery from the iphone does not last long and the problem began already in the warranty, at temperatures below 10 degrees, it simply turns off, although still over 60% charge were. now the hammer, in the guarantee nothing was done by apple, I was fed with the statement, I would use it too much!	0
Have received the iPhone today, installed - including glued on protective film - only to then determine that the screen flickers.Fern the iPhone is a badly written message in front of a complaint or bad review when a Matthew Winterburn to report ... ... it does not work! I also thought I had bought a new device and not obviously refurbished phone. Total disappointment for Euro 490, - IPhone will be handled by Amazon back	0
This phone is NOT NEW is overhauled !! impudence !!!!!	0

Hello I am not satisfied at all! First came the phone with screen damage. Since you went down a bit with the price. But after two months the battery failed completely !!! I cheated on Apple. The said, the phone is made up of many third-party parts together. I can only advise everyone: Let the fingers of this provider !!!	0
Have bought here an iPhone 6s as an exhibit. Are after 6 months and 3 !!! unsuccessful attempts to repair the purchase have receded and have been deducted as a fee for the time 265, - €. Almost only half of the purchase price !!! Unfortunately, this shop is not recommended in my opinion .....	0

I have not bought the product on Amazon, but I thought I still report my experience with this iPhone. Processing and quality is actually pretty apple like. So very good !! Own this iPhone for about 2 years. There are only two problems with this phone: 1. Battery running time under one day2. It has become bent over time, making a battery exchange impossible I'm sorry Apple ... but not acceptable for a company like you !!	0
Bought as a new device in September 2018. After 2 months with each message input and ringing a "snarling noise". I finally managed to stop by in an Apple Store. A friendly customer service representative looked at the device and came to the following result: -Display not original smartphone comes from 2016 and was already registered with Apple "so in use vibration spring not screwed! Four provided screws were missing completely and the spring was loose in the device, which then caused the snarling noise.- Display and housing (splash-splice) was not available! This dealer is absolutely NOT recommended! Hands off!!! This borders on fraud !!!	0
Hello ... the phone is 2 months old and now the battery has lifted and the phone is not working properly ... is constantly up and down ... the battery is within a very short time to zero. How can you continue us help, after all, Apple allegedly of quality. Please contact me as soon as possible ... I'm afraid that the battery exploriert.Mfg Tina war	0
The screen was detached on the left side of the device and the battery could not charge even though the device was connected to power for more than 6 hours. Not recommended!	0
No original Apple packaging, no headphones, doubts about the original product - this should actually be pointed out in the product description. I hope it will be considered in the future.	0
For this price (339 €), I have more from the Apple erwatet.Besonders, the night shots with flash are all overexposed and unusable. Even the advisor of Saturn could not help me. It was a bad buy and will not recommend it. It is a cell phone for people who do not take photos at night. And what I did not know, once you paid for the device, you can not give it back.	0
I'm just writing a few facts- November 2015- Black Display in April 2017- seller PhoneAdix contacted on Amazon and after a week still no response from the merchant.- in the meantime the display is working again (cause, reason unknown) My conclusion: Merchant PhoneAdix not recommended 0 Sterne.iPhone 6s AppleViel money for a so-called premium device paid and after 1 year no service or help. Not from the dealer and Apple is going out after a year. Thanks Apple. Should the display now give up the ghost, then I may certainly reach for a repair deep in the bag.	0
Was my 5th and last iPhone. The thing is too big to keep it comfortable. The battery is empty even though I do not use it all the time and the GPS thinks I'm mostly somewhere like 300-500m. Completely useless.	0
I bought the device in October 2016. After 4 days there was no sound and videos could not be played. Back to the dealer. Get a new phone. This is now broken, after 21 months. The battery could not be charged anymore. Lt. Apple total loss. All holiday pictures away. Never again Apple.	0
Not even 5 months later, my speakers are broken! I would rather have bought one in the store, because I could have exchanged it now at least!	0
Item was broken! It did not even take a minute and the screen went black.	0
As a new device has been sold, but the Apple Store could see at the repair that it was already used in the US. Not recommended!	0

Unfortunately, I can not take a picture after a month and I have a lot of problems	0
Am very disappointed. After only 4 days much on that the battery discharges extremely fast. In addition, the display on the edge comes out of the phone. See photos	0
Hello, I already had smartphones from several manufacturers but always with Android operating system, they all had some problem, so I decided (although I was strictly against Apple) to try something new and to buy an Iphone. Everything works really well, until I noticed a few weeks ago (ca1 years old) that the battery performance is constantly read, although I have not installed many apps.	0
First: I am actually a peaceful-friendly Apple Iphone user since the Iphone 4. Only since the 6s started the trouble. Somehow there is now the worm in it and the whole Apple experience came to a halt, also thanks to lack of Inovation. Right annoying is the battery error: My 6s turns off in a light cold immediately (whether walking, running / jogging, photos at the customer to attempt). I asked the telephone support for clarification months ago and they have actually admitted that there are massive problems (allegedly because of incorrect programming) but my battery would be - according to remote maintenance - in order. Then I was in Centro Oberhausen over Christmas and I'm there in the Apple Store. Behold! There is now an exchange program (found on the apple page and support and then at the bottom "" 6s turns off "" Check here if your phone is affected - Yes of course it was das.Ich could leave the Iphone there and then pick up in 4 days ... erhh yes tips idea.Since I live not in the Centro Oberhausen I have called a Gravis Store in my city. Currently, so many phones are affected (so here can not be the case of individual cases!) that I have to wait three weeks for the new battery, because Apple does not exchange or send out new batteries - NO - first my phone has to be sent in and then there is the new battery - well, what am I doing with my customers in the meantime? Or no matter what, do private individuals who would like to have a cell phone in time? Why Apple offers nothing for (replacement of the cell phone - you should repair it and then resell or take back the scrap and give us a new one). I think it's not ok anyway a cell phone which 800, - EUR now costs to open and reinsert the battery in a service building. This has m.M.n. then nothing more to do with the quality directly from the factory and is still a real Entwertung.Also be careful at 6s - I would not buy it anymore. Make your own picture and google for the battery problem that is very common.	0
My device was defective I had it exchanged at Apple never again I would buy from you something like that does not work.	0
I use for 9 months. for no reason. Broken. I'm going to Service Center now. Can not understand why h h	0
The touchscreen is a disaster. It usually takes several tries to detect what to click. The HTC one is fine.	0
I was actually a happy Apple user. Had always IPhones, MacBooks and IPads. Above all the reliability and stability of the software as well as the optimal software tuning on the hardware let me buy again and again a new Apple product despite the clearly higher price compared to competing products. Also, the compatibility of the profucts was very good. In the meantime, I have bought laptops and smartphones from other manufacturers with the software Windows and Android, due to a significantly better price-performance ratio, but I am always returned to Apple products mainly due to the simple and reliable condition. After I had the iPhone 6s exactly 1 year, started several massive problems at the same time. The iPhone 6s crashes completely for no reason despite the simplest applications. It always switches off at a battery charge of 20 - 40% and goes on (if at all) only briefly for a few seconds again. The software is of course always up to date. Resolutions did not solve any of the problems mentioned. Also, I exclude a misuse and handling of battery or charging. What a coincidence that these problems exactly 1 year after the purchase of the product (840 € im Apple Store) while Apple is still as good as all other electronics manufacturers ONLY 1 year warranty on its products instead of the usual 2-year warranty, as practiced even by the cheapest no-name manufacturers. A rogue who thinks of planned obsolescence? I will not now as planned, the new IPhone 7 grow and buy no other iPhone. There are some alternatives and fortunately I am not "brand fixed" which makes me open to all manufacturers. Recommend everyone to do the same, because as we know: "" Competition gives wings to the market "".	0
I would like to give 5 but I ordered the phone on 30 August and now it is the 16 September.Wann the cell phone has arrived at your place?	0
I am in possession of the shell since the end of January. The processing of the shell is ok. However for the price I would have liked a higher quality processing. Glued parts of the case were not really glued fit. The longevity of the case leaves a lot to be desired. For me breaks after the short use since the plastic of the holder for the smartphone. The iPhone has never fallen down. The phone is generally in my hand, on the desk or in my purse. Therefore, not understandable why the shell breaks. In itself, the window and the recess are very convenient. I can not determine a worse reception by using the case. Once again I would not buy the case for this high price anymore.	0
The iPhone is just too big. I bought the iPhone SE, just perfect. What a pity Apple, why necessarily do everything as the competition? Is bigger really better? I do not think so, and the SE is proof of that.	0
The design is beautiful, because it is noble. The processor is super fast and all games run fluently. The battery is unfortunately Krotenschlecht, Although I do not use the mobile overnight, the battery drops by 10 percent, and the battery does not even hold a day through, and my IPhone is just 15 percent always aus.Bin gone to the Apple Store and have looked after whether that is the case of the Apple Austauschproramm (free battery replacement) it was a production error at Apple, but no mine was not there think it is a total Impudence although it is every day Sun. Have my battery stop money for exchange anyway for 60 euros and have the same problem again, absoulute impudence tried my money back, but they did not do it and they were also still unfriendly. Break Apple.I climb to the Samsung Galaxy s7 because it is much better. Apple is an abominable rip-off. I throw the shitty cellphone into the bin, can not do that anymore need.APPLE YOU ARE EASY TOO MUCH TOO MUCH ABOARD CLUB CLUB.	0
I bought the iPhone 6s about 1month before Christmas 2015 and had to notice with astonishment (about 2 months later) that dust in the form of small black dots under the screen was visible. So I sent in the device and got it back after a whopping 7 WEEKS. The screen has been replaced, but there is again a black dot in the middle of the screen. I've really wondered (because of the 7 months and no real improvement) if people at Apple are unable to work properly! So for this price (€ 740) it was a total REINFALL! NO PURCHASE RECOMMENDATION !!!! Buy 740 cheeseburgers at mc's, because you will definitely get more for your money! Price-performance is not right at Apple !!	0
I ordered the iPhone 6s, the iPhone arrived in great condition with me! However, I can not activate it? Have already phoned Apple for hours and no one can tell me what is wrong with this device. Original invoice was of course not there! I'm really angry!	0
I had bought the Iphone 6s. However, it has turned off after 2 months just like that and can not be switched on again.Bin curious if I get a new one.	0

One of the worst phones I had. Unfortunately we have to click on a star, at least, so we do it. In my opinion, the iPhone has earned GARKEINEN star !!! Through all the hiccup with the Apple ID and generally through Apple's administration, you get aggression and are just angry. It has entered everything correctly and yet it does not work at Apple.com .. I did not continue at all but the iPhone broke and disposed of directly. As you know, rubbish should be thrown away, that is to say done! I stay with the well-known and simple module, the samsung! :-)	0
Who brows a lot should avoid this cell phone. In my summerhouse we have a good data connection over 3G and 4G - with devices like the (much cheaper old model) Galaxy A3. Only with the expensive 6s iPhone is it very slow. Sometimes the connection is completely out, you have to wait 1 minute. The screen is not high resolution, the man recognizes immediately. All in all, a nice device top processing but purely technically a beginner model.	0
I had an iPhone 4, 2x 4s and a 5s and I have a MacBook Pro and Apple TV is so familiar with Apple products and actually appreciate the quality and ease of use of the products. The 6s is the first iPhone, which I am very disappointed. For one, it does not bring any meaningful novelties and bores through it. It's the first iPhone that I do not think wow cool part. That alone would be a pity, of course, but not a real problem. What on the other hand is a problem for me is that after just 4 months makes problems that I know otherwise only from hearsay other smartphones. The battery of the 6s discharges faster than any other iPhone. In one day, the battery has 40% and it just goes out and requires power. On another day, it consumes between 60-80% charge within 6 hours without a charger. Even my 4 year old 4s lasts much longer. As if that was not enough, the 6s has so many software problems, like no other of my iPhones before that. Even a 1/8 Huawei Y550 works better, probably because Steve Jobs is no longer living. The first iPhone after his death, he had probably still been involved or Apple still had ideas of him in the bag, but they seem to be used up. In the meantime, I have the feeling that you only pay for the name at Apple and not the wonderful uniqueness and quality that an iPhone once had. Of course NOT a buy recommendation!	0
I do not really know what to think of the positive reviews written here. My family has been using Apple phones for a while, but not me. Nobody could really convince me so far to buy an Apple device. Although there are also regular updates for the devices but these only cause problems. Starting with shortened battery life up to suspended IOS. And I had to judge it again and again as an old Android root user. Have screwed around on these iphones often and I can only say one thing: Save the nice money. Apple should finally start to develop better devices for this price range. Highend devices with Android operating system allow more options, that goes with Apple only with the annoying Jailbreak variant. Apple devices are in my opinion for users who prefer a very simple operation or are simply overwhelmed with Android. Anyway, Apple has not convinced me so far. This has nothing to do with the price, because you get at Samsung and Co simply more.	0
I have my iPhone now 1.5 years. The battery is already broken and Appel gives only ONE year warranty on batteries. Every other mobile phone is guaranteed for 2 years. And that at the price ??? That can not be. No more an iPhone	0
Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!	0
Bo Ey! What a junk scrap !!! A cell phone that bends in your pocket. For music or movies from PC on only with Eiertunes possible? Only with the control of Appel.Komisch my fun machine Galaxy S7 Edge I connect to the PC and the phone is run as a drive and invite gigabyte way drauf.Ohne any Software.Da you can see how you are ripped off by this Appel consortium .No in mine I will buy myself an eggphone.Igitigit this unit design. Against a Samsung S7 will never come along with an Appel Phone. The phone is a real fun machine. Pictures and video quality of the finest. Haptics and processing only the best. Maybe also have a look. 1 × Galaxy and you never want to return the Appel electric garbage	0
After 2 months I change back to my iPhone 5S because of a pain in my wrist.This iPhone is too big! I hope there will be another iPhone on the market, which you can not use to kill people.	0
The iphone 6s ... a very controversial smartphone ... oh sorry IPHONE of course. I'm more of a fan of the Sony or google nexus series and always had a very bad relationship with appel products. Too expensive, no better than other brands and especially not compatible with other operating systems. These were the typical fears I had. Even if not all really true, they are nevertheless almost all true. The first problem on iphone 6s is the price in my opinion. This shocked me a lot because I am used to getting amazone often very cheap deals. Well, despite this outrageous price, I bought this smartphone angrily. Now the absolute horror began. The iPhone 6s was delivered to SPÆT ONE week for its unreliable delivery services in Germany. That did not improve my attitude towards the iPhone. In the evening after a stressful working day, I gladly unpacked the package. The actual iPhone pack looked very good and neatly processed. In this was a charging cable, a unfortunately not too restrictive instructions and of course the iPhone 6s itself. To my surprise, but no ear-plugs as is the case with many other smartphone manufacturers. Finally, the phone itself. Even if I do not like the formation of iPhones this looked quite passable. The surface is pleasant to touch, but the smartphone slipped from my hand several times a day after a week of use. The shape is not very grippy. The processing quality is so far quite okay and I noticed nothing more negtives. The color of the Displys is perfect and I liked it very well. With the size of the phone, I was not quite good enough, which could be due to the fact that my hands are not too big. Now to the most important: the use. The everyday use is actually rather impractical with this mobile because it is very large and therefore hardly fits in trouser or jacket pockets. As I said, this iPhone tested a week, but actually often wanted to use my smaller smartphone. The drive speed is actually very good. What I noticed as the only VERY POSITIVE was the battery life. Despite everyday business use and with permanently connected WLANs, I had to charge the phone only every other day. But this positive point of the battery unfortunately also brings the most negative for me with this smartphone. This problem has the complete appel series, namely the ports, etc. I, a user of Android smartphones and Windows PCs had great difficulties to couple devices ... that is for non-exclusive apple users a huge problem. So, if we were already at the extraordinary features of Apple, it should be noted as a second, very, negative point, the android user with the apple operating system not easy or difficult to cope. So it was very hard for me to get used to ios and then to regain my money. So the iPhone 6s is now back to Amazon	0

When unpacking the phone looks very nice, a few hours in the hand after that but then the interest is gone again. Many less choice of apps, the battery is also a joke and you can not attach more than 3 devices when tethering ... There is definitely a lot better Android ... Never again Iphone !!	0

Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!	0
The worst thing that can happen to a smartphone is a bad battery life. The I Phone 6S is not only bad but by far the worst measured value of all time in the history of the I Phones, that's a death sentence. For me personally, it is enough to be constantly fooled by Apple! For two days, I have a Galaxy S5, that's a battery life of Apple can only dream. And the Android operating system, I now find better than IOS.Nie Apple again!	0
The question is, if you really spend so much money, if you need the new features. Of course, everything is top-processed and innovative. But what about moisture or dust protection? Our smartphone is always with us, holidays on the beach with sand, canoe trip in the water or a birthday party, where one of you the beer or the coffee accidentally on the phone. Others offer more for less. But as a prestige object it is a real recommendation.	0
I had years of iphones from the 3 to the 5 I had all but what has changed really nothing did not look like that but otherwise always the same battery lasts a day maybe 2 you have to make all the extra accessories of apple shopping software synonymous only of appleund the manufacturing cost 225 € eim 6s and the restalso in my eyes is only rip off but if the people are so stupid they should continue to buy so overpriced equipment ichich but I switched to lg had the g2, g3 and now the g4 a top cell phone battery holds to me from Sunday to Saturday compared to the iPhone 6 I tested a week only 2 days and also I can expand my memory and use any accessories and other software just like so people think a little bit and try something else fun	0
Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap!

The Iphone 6s is the worst radioactive device I've never seen in my life ......... I hate appeal	0
I needed an iPhone for work. Almost 240 € for an alleged exhibit I find really expensive, but I thought, then at least I get a well-functioning model. Unfortunately, one hardly hears me, when talking on the phone. It only works via loudspeaker or headset. This is really poor, since it is after all a telephone. The camera is really great and fun to shoot and take pictures with. Except for the bad speaker, I'm so satisfied. Even though I do not think the device was an exhibit. It looks more like used and badly repaired. If I had a replacement, I would have sent it back immediately. Next time I use another provider.6 months after the purchase, I can not use the device because the battery is no longer charged. Within 4 weeks, the performance decreased rapidly and in the end, I was not even allowed to remove it from the charging station because otherwise it would have gone out immediately. Now it is not even more. What else should I say? I wish I had invested the money elsewhere. That was a sad and expensive experience.	0
The device was in very good condition, but WITHOUT the original accessories. The device was a cheap China imitations, the already after about 12 months use the blessed blessing.Janado said that the device is unfortunately out of warranty, since only 12 months warranty on the device would be, since it is B-commodity would act and you could thus do nothing for me. In the item description was not apparent that there is no original accessories or the only 12 months warranty on the device. Usual are at Amazon 24 months. The dealer advertises the one with the Prime logo, which further confuses.	0
Since I had my device for repair today (display damage) my repairer told me that it was not a new device or the original Apple 6s. He showed me that the battery is not original, it lacked a clip to stabilize the battery and a few small things that were not installed by Apple. Since I bought the device as a new product that is a huge mess and noticed only after 9 months by the exchange of the display. If I could I would give 0 stars.	0
Device simply stopped working after a few days for no apparent reason. Have tried everything, but the touch screen was simply black. I had the I-Phone 4s before, where I never had such problems. Just sent it back, because I really do not know why it could be?	0
Out of the box error. Bluetooth and W-LAN module has been hung up all the time. Could not fix anything with an update. Go back. Amazon returns unaddressed	0
Hello. I ordered a new extra (unused) iphone 6s. And while a very used mobile phone Very unprofsional packaged pakket to get asked. Will of course send again.	0
The smartphone was described as "as new" and should be free of scratches according to the description! Unfortunately this was not the case! The device has a lot of minor scratches, which I did not find so bad, because it is a used device. Unfortunately, this phone had a relatively large Kratzerfas center on the display (in the photo, unfortunately, not so good to see). In addition, it was on the back, faded by using a sleeve with logo cut so much that this was ultimately the reason why I have sent it back (s.Foto). I am a little surprised, because the seller has received good reviews and I therefore ordered. Maybe I was also sent a wrong device. Pity!	0
An absolute impudence. Top quality or "like new" can not even be mentioned in the beginning. The smartphone had a broken screen and no small Klitsche as described, in addition to strong nicks on make corners. Scratches on the back and front, totally worn charging cable. Maximum battery power was below 82%. For a smartphone that bears the label "like new" unreasonable. Rather used. Have ordered once and do that niewkeder. I strongly discount from.	0
I have the iPhone 6s since last year and have always been very satisfied. Since ios 11 was installed I only have problems. My screen turns black and it does not react anymore. The touch screen locks and I can not do anything anymore. Phone calls are simply canceled and the iPhone stops responding. I really love it but that annoys me so much. You spend so much money and then something like that. Even reset network settings did not work. I'm really sorry :(	0
I assumed to have acquired a new iphone from a German seller. It came a device with a power plug that does not fit German sockets. A German charger was separate. The device had a Spanish default and otherwise a rather "" wild "" basic configuration. A bill with VAT ID card was also not there, so that I can now draw no input tax, which makes the device by a whopping 19% more expensive. Dear Amazon, I trust as a customer actually that you protect me from such unpleasant surprises and list only sellers who either supply the goods, which I can expect or who clearly point out deviations in their description. We only kept the device because we needed immediate replacement because of theft, otherwise we would have sent it back. After all, the delivery took place within 24 hours.	0
Am transferring from Nokia Winphone to Iphone. I like Apple's many apps and billing the store. In addition the connection to my 2 Ipads. Data security also plays a role, but who knows ... I need a lot of the phone camera. This is clearly worse at Apple. At 35% battery charge and cold weather, the phone turns off after each photo. The 6S has to be loaded every day although I do not run any games, call or mile much. With Windowsphone the charge lasted 3 days.	0
Unfortunately, I was struggling with weak LTE Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections. In addition, my interlocutors complained about a bad call quality. I have been an Apple customer since 1990 and have owned all iPhone models. Since the 6 Series and SE Series, I do not find the quality, what to expect from such an expensive product. The 6s and also the iPhone SE, which I had shortly before were both inferior. Luckily, you can return the device to Amazon within 30 days.	0
The delivered device had the so-called "Ghost Touch" problem. This means that after unpacking and first attempting to set up the smartphone, it automatically performed entries. It automatically entered letters, which made it impossible to set up the smartphone correctly. When trying to enter the e-mail address were constantly inserted five or 25 new letters. The device then went back unfortunately. However, praise to the seller for the quick reimbursement of the amount and easy return.	0
My review only relates to the durability / sustainability of this product. Today's products are generally subject to a planned obsolescence should be clear to everyone (which is why one morally committed to our environment would be sustainable / Fairtrade products to buy). However, one can expect a cell phone to last at least two years until the next contract extension without major failures. Already with my previous Iphone 5s the Lightning connector was broken shortly after one year and had to be replaced. At the present 6s he has endured almost 1.5 years until I had to have him repaired for 70 €. Now shortly thereafter, the ear speaker has failed. All this despite the fact that my phone has been well maintained / protected all along (bulletproof glass, sturdy case, normal usage, no crashes). Overall, this is just very annoying and a huge impudence. For me, Apple products are therefore no longer in question in the future.	0
After 11 months, the device did not turn on. Already the next day it was picked up by DHL and brought to repair, so far as well - two days later came the news that the Iphone was bent (with a photo) and I have to pay 321 € for the repair. A deformation is not really visible on the photo and certainly not the reason for the error, which is why I have asked the support for a recall and made my objections. The employee told me that Apple always repairs ALL errors of a device and one (which? ?) Deformation is accidental damage, which is why the warranty is not given. No matter for what reason the repair order was issued!	0
Not mine. I miss the variety as usual from Android. Haptic is great, display could be a bit bigger. I stay with Android	0
I am getting black right now. In the Apple Store, I ordered the iPhone 6s 128GB and put it into operation today. I use O2 Multicard and of course I have the old iPhone 4s lying next to the improvements directly to see. All fine; 3D touch, Retina display and of course a lot of nice gimmicks. The mobile reception is very sobering; Both iPhones have the decibel indicator (iPhone Field test) set up, and the age-old bone has a paltry 20dB better reception (see picture). The crucial difference between being able to make calls or not. I have been extra waiting for the "" s "" model since in this case most of the negative aspects have been improved. Of course, I have created similar circumstances. Comparable settings (mobile data on / off), both devices with / without case, etc. do not understand me wrong; I do not want to miss my iFuhrpark anymore, but dear hardware manufacturers (and I mean all of them), please make phones again with the phone is also possible again. € 1000, - for a gadget that scolds phone and can not talk on the phone is not OK	0
did not buy the iphone at amazon, but would like to say that the fingerprint sensor works very bad! thumb is simply not recognized, everything tried, reset, reprogramming the finger, very frustrating. With version 10.0 it worked very well, before and now at 10.02 not more, such a blunder, because otherwise it is indeed a really great operating system	0
How can this smartphone cost € 750? This is much more expensive than the current iPhone 7! Even on the Apple website you get it MUCH cheaper!	0
The ordered iPhone never arrived at ours. I had already read that in other reviews. Amazon has refunded the purchase price without hesitation. So at least it was without risk. Only stupid, if you ordered it as a gift ...	0
I bought the iPhone 6s because I am very satisfied with the iMac 5K. However, taking over my old files from the Samsung Galaxy S 5 did not work out at all! In the settings of the font, which is also very small, there are only 2 options. The smartphone is really good, if you always had Apple devices. In any case, Android's transition is paved with violent stumbling blocks. I would have wished that with such an expensive device a reasonable software to take over the files of Android devices is! That's why I gave the smartphone back. As I said, the smartphone is good, but these restrictive Apple speak for me currently against the iPhone. Maybe it manages so that Android smartphones are recognized on the iMac and there is a software for data synchronization between Android and Windows Phone devices.	0
I changed from the 5s to the 6s, so I'm used to Apple. What strikes me are the small nuances that creep in. This starts with the shorter battery life and continues with the scratching and shaking of the original Apple EarPod plug when I plug the device into my pocket or touch the connector. Sure, I could use my Sennheiser headphones but I do not want that and was not necessary until the 5s because the original accessories reflected a basic quality. Other nuances are the protruding camera, which does not bother me since I use an original Apple leather case. However, it represents a design carver that would have been impossible with jobs. The case shows further changes. The case no longer encloses the whole device but leaves the lower part of the speaker, Lightning and Micro open and unprotected. In addition to the fact that the two lower corners visible not as complex Complete as the old case of 5s leaves it with the overall appearance of a strange taste and makes it appear less high-quality altogether. The only thing that is still accustomed Apple is the price. In conclusion, disappointing for me. The zenith is over. Apart from my remarks, it certainly remains a solid device that its lovers will find. I do not belong anymore and will give it back despite financial loss and hope that my 5s still works.	0
Unhandlich.Kamera freezes constantly. ein.Nach nearly two months Mute Button defective.Costs for time, approach and display due to the film defect of course I pay.With the reality, stock valuations have nothing to do on the stock market.	0
Impasse Apple !!! I gave my daughter a new iPhone on her birthday. The device is defective, does not charge, tried everything, other power supply, other cable no success! So call hotline, she gets earliest in a week !!!! Replacement, no replacement, so she does not have a phone for a week! Then I tried to call the hotline! The usual, IVR system answers thousands of questions but can not reach an employee. Abandoned after twenty minutes! So ! never Apple again !!!	0
This is totally great that Apple with the Iphone logs my whereabouts ... regularly ... unencrypted. Motion profiles are great, with total supervision, we soon have the total employment. But hey, wait ... Then NSA and BND have not more so much work. That makes jobs broken !? Can Apple? Have the ne license to monitor ... and from whom ever? Then always these problems, a memory card in the Iphone zugen.Und also the USB port does not fit yet. Is crap!	0
I got the iPhone 6s cheap from the circle of acquaintances, otherwise I always had Android devices. But since I have an iPad, I already knew the software a bit. So the processing is already the first criticism, the slide for the Nano Sim card can move with too much game when it is plugged. Even the home button has too much play and clacking for this price range. The back scratched extremely lightly, the front not so easy. You can not offer a cell phone for such a high price and then say that customers should buy a protective cover so that it does not scratch, it has to be built more robust, so it will be a shoe out of it! In this respect, the much-praised processing quality of iPhones is just a marvel, you just have to look closely, then you realize the miscibility, which are simply unacceptable in the price range. Otherwise, the screen is sharp, but in 2016 with its 4.7 inches and HD resolution not up to date, it should be in my opinion already 5 inches, incomprehensible that Apple is there so hesitant and backward-facing. The operation is really bad in relation to Android devices. This concept of closing with the home button has never opened to me. Why not use the backspace or exit key as touch keys ?? This is also possible with the Assistive Touch function, but not very elegant. The apps run smoothly, but updates take too long even in the WLAN network. The cameras are both good, there is nothing to moan about. The more outrageous that one does not install an optical image stabilizer in this price range. The camera looks out of the too heavy case out (just under 140 grams), the device gets very hot under high load, the battery is a bad joke, no FM radio included, resolution under Full HD. All in all, the device for 850 euros new price in the 64 GB version is much too expensive and the money should make more sense to invest. But as long as there are enough people who throw money into the mouth of Apple for such technology, the probably more fat and the poor factory workers in China are getting dehydrated. Apple runs the Android manufacturers technically for years afterwards. 3D-Touch does not need a human, it would be enough, you hold down a little longer than to apply so much pressure on the screen. Something completely incomprehensible: the fingerprint sensor works only after you have previously pressed the power or home button. Other manufacturers can do that so that you only have to hang up your finger and it is unlocked. The headphones from Apple are miserable, both in sound and build quality, and also slip out of the ear due to the strange shape. The voice quality when telephoning is in view of the price just as bad to call, there is always an annoying noise floor available. I give the iPhone 6S now someone who really wants it, I do not, what a miserable phone.	0
This is doubtless a work of magisterial technology, but how can anoyne buy a product from a company that won't pay its taxes? Shame on Apple!	0
It is a nice mobile phone with a nice design. The software is quite good and has only crashed once. But the price of the phone (then 800 euros) is extremely overpriced. The added value I see here (with the exception of the camera) not. Because with a cheap HTC or Blackberry is just as clear and that costs less than half. Naughty the price but in the face of the shabby screen. Once dropped on the ground, a nice thick crack is visible. At Apple I was told that I should have attached a cover. At 800 euros I would have thought that the material is now a bit more resistant (in the iPhones 1 and 2, almost every second copy was affected by this deficiency). Even my cheap Blackberry, which I had used before, flew to the ground every week and nothing happened. In the future I will refrain from joining this hipster mania to enjoy a minimalistic scrap with a maximailistic crack. The next time I scrape together 800 euros, I'll rather buy 800 cheeseburgers at McDonald's - or 450 cheeseburgers plus 1 Blackberry. Then I'm not so hip, but at least survive the next hunger period and at least can still look at the scratch-free cheap screen of Blackberry.	0
iOS became really bad and outdated over the last couple of years specially compared to the latest Android releases and the brilliant piece of hardware is now the very last thing holding up with this phone.	0
Very negative things from iphone 6s1.) Extremely slow charging the Akku2.) One can not APK `s as with android install. 3) One can not simply transfer videos or Mp3 with USB cable on iphone4.) One can not via WiFi Direct or Send Bluetooth data, not even with NFC5.) Man can not download videos from TubeMate like TubeMate, and convert directly to MP36.) The battery runs fast empty max. Holds at normal nutzun 6 hours, with 2 hours. Telephony without just playing whatsApp without video.7.) There are no video and photo settings8.) Many apps at android which is free or cheaper, costs money at iphone or twice as expensive ... 9.) Many of my favorite apps at iphone 6s does not exist, eg AndroVid, RealGPS, DroidVPN.Also almost no positive thing, only that it is fast, but functions are worse, I do not know what is so great there? In my opinion bad mobile phone, just like the Windows Phone	0
My urgent recommendation (26.03.2016): Switch to the Jolla-Phone. Finnish understatement, a hundred times hipper than Apple's all-round bug. And also without anti-democratic NSA connection (no 5eye, no Patriot Act)! I have now made the detour via Blackberry (using the Canadians '5eye' Android) to JOLLA. Ergonomic, reliable, removable battery, 2-3 days battery life. For 199, - €. in 5 days the JollaPhone is with you. Incl. Right of Withdrawal - Take the opportunity and try it out! And one more thing: anyone who clicks anonymously on the negative side or, in part, pitifully condescending to the new Stasi, has already lost today. Resist, Leite. Freedom is more important than all these apps for teens.Here's the review ... I was a fan and a loyal customer of Apple. Have bought a number of professional Apple computers, iPods, iPhones and tablets from the manufacturer and gladly used. After the group acts as a stooge of various anti-democratic intelligence agencies, all of which violate our liberal fundamental rights, I will the group until further notice, no "" fresh Money "" Apple has become the pioneer of all henchmen of total surveillance. Virtually everything that happens on the internet is collected in Utah (Utah Data Center -> google). Data about unwelcome journalists. Data about our politicians of tomorrow. Data on decision-makers in politics and business, which deviate too much from the course.Democracy is being eroded. People become blackmailable! Apple is the only smartphone maker ALL component hardware firmware software (iOS operating system) - Synchronization software and MediaShop (iTunes) This combination requires a responsible, confidential handling of personal customer data. This responsibility was and is Apple as an NSA cooperation partner does justice. Keywords: - Private data, contacts, information on media user behavior is not protected from access by third parties - Apple's NSA cooperation (US intelligence, which closely monitors the FRG) - GPS -Data / motion profiles land on US servers, to which the US secret service NSA has direct access.- Software with "" backdoors "" provided - hardware remotely controllable (camera, microphone) - fingerprint scanner (this feature would have me in one SouthPark episode on the NSA cooperation requested) - questionable for professional use, eg. B for investigative journalists (informant protection), judges, lawyers, politicians, environmental activists, doctors and young people who want to pursue a comparable career - French and Brazilian parliamentarians are prohibited from using such devices for security reasons - As a luxury device in the professional segment only conditionally suitable - THANK YOU EDWARD SNOWDEN! - THANK YOU GLENN GREENWALD! - THANK YOU "" THE GUARDIAN ""! Further: - Foxconn (maximum return for shareholders) Otherwise, a great device. Private users, who are uncritical of developments in government surveillance and data retention, are likely to enjoy their device. Note ("Apple did not have a choice ..."): "There is a positive example, a company called" "lavabit" ". A provider of encrypted communications. Mr. Snowden has sometimes communicated about this service. The NSA wanted to force the managing director, Mr. Ladar Levison, to publish a general key or access to the server / user data. Mr. Levison preferred to quit his job, his livelihood. I'm sure that if Apple, Microsoft, google, yahoo, facebook, skype had gone public together in due course, an NSA boss would have lost his job and finished. It looks like all of these companies are architects of total surveillance. Maybe to defend democratic values ​​in faith. At least since we know that the "democratization" of countries like Iraq or Ukraine clearly does not aim to improve the lives of the people, it is important to punish the accomplices and their followers.Who is committed to freedom and Sometimes betraying democracy by doing commissioned work for Apple or its clients here should make it ashamed and think about what mess he / she will leave to his / her children. Do not participate. Perform resistance!	0
After many years of iPhone use only I bought One Plus One with 64 Gb for only 300 Euro! That works so much better and makes so much better photo and video !!! So where does this high price for iPhone come from, I have no idea!	0

After a week, the battery was extremely hot for no apparent reason. After that, the phone did not start anymore.	0
Was very happy with the phone at the beginning. After a few days, however, the charger was battered but I did not think much. After 3-4 weeks, my battery from the one on the other day did not stop at all and then I wanted to charge it and it just can not be switched on. I tried everything but it is broken. Now I have sent it back and hope that I get the money back.	0
Battery is not what expected! That is the reason why it took a time to respond. Only a capacity of 85 % and sometimes switches off unexpectedly. I am disappointed of the money spent.	0
This is a good quality smartphone but there are some flaws to consider when buying this smartphone.The display quality is good, the camera quality is decent but far from the best available. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and the Huawei Mate Pro 20 have far better quality cameras and cost less to purchase.The battery life on this smartphone is okay and you get a decent amount of use before requiring a recharge.The performance is good and reliable and the construction of this smartphone is nice and it has a combination of durable glass, surgical grade stainless steel and an IP68 waterproof rating.This smartphone has Advanced Face ID which can be used to unlock your smartphone, Log into banking apps and more.

Also not long ago it has been exposed Apple have been providing software updates for customers with older Apple products in order to slow down performance of their Apple product, making customers believe they need to replace their Apple products with new Apple products.This scandal has been reported in the mainstream media and there are plans to bring a class action against Apple for this immoral practice. Many customers can not afford a replacement and would like their phone to last as long as possible and what you get is the manufacturer these customers trusted giving them updates to slow down their product and ultimately profit from it and there are privacy concerns and backdoor access issues with this smartphone.Thanks for reading my review I hope you found it helpful.	0
Neither the microphone nor the speakers on this telephone work properly. More troublesome I don’t know how to get the warranty on it. Does it go to Apple? Nobody tells you	0

Iphones are over rated over price i never buy one i just bought Samsung Galaxy A9 has 4 cameras on the back each one 24mp starts with 180gb expendable to 512gb so bought the handset and sd card 512gb for 2 only paid £550 that well under half price of an iphone Samsung android itself much faster using internet too takes seconds to use internet even very fast connecting to wifi	0
Just buy Huawei or honor 8x for £220 this is a huge waste of money and the same as last year's iPhone	0
I don't know what happened here, the delivery was great, but for some strange reason after opening and fully charging the phone while i was trying to set it up the phone started to get hot not sure why but i was so hot i had to turn it off and left it for a bit, i used the charger it came with to charge so i don't know why it was running hot but it did. when i turned it back on to continue with the set up lol it got hot even faster. so yea i was left with maybe 30 minutes of the phone usage before i packed it up and drop it off to return by Hermes which was a whole terrible experience. I have not heard from anyone since it was return June 1, 2019, even the tracking information is f-ed up. So yeah if you want a phone that will work please just go to Apple it will be worth it trust me	0
Seriously not worth the money.Sure it's got an Apple logo but value for money wise. Appalling.For £500 less can get a Samsung S10 with twice the storage and expandable.Or less than half the price an oppo7 with 256gig storage.And then the build quality, sure it looks nice but drop in on the sofa and the screen will crack.Apple doesn't care about it's customers any more, too many people see the logo and follow the pack. Open your eyes. Can honestly say will never go back to Apple.	0
For what your paying, an extortionate £1000 you could have so much more, the value for money is ridiculously unbalanced. If you have a brain look up what youre paying for, and youll never buy from Apple again	0

The hearing piece for the phone has already gone . I was sold a piece of crap and I can’t do anything about it . Literally have to plug in my earphones or put on my speaker to hear people speak .	0
The screen is great and face id works as well as touch id.It’s too big, the glass sandwich construction feels cheap (slippery with rough edges), and the camera bump is huge. If I drop it indoors I expect it to break.This is the first iPhone where I feel the design and build quality has taken a backward step.	0
⭐️ Screen — this actually looks fine. Visually, the phone is stunning 😍⭐️ Battery life — superb.The problem is the size and heft — It’s far too big and heavy.The front and back are glass.It's a very breakable glass sandwich!Swiping up from the bottom is very fluid — It’s buttery smooth and replicates what pressing the (missing) home button would do.Touch ID is still superior and more reliable than FaceID.	0
Awful, avoid ! I upgraded from the iPhone 6S 64gb and regret it bitterly ! Apps thT I’ve been happy using for years suddenly freeze and crash on the XR! All Apple support can offer as a solution is texture to factory defaults ! Get a Samsung instead !	0
print-off on the new phone!! and big price drop, with £120 drop. try to contact with them, but no replacement for the phone due to print-off problem.	0
I would put a zero star rating if allowed.  I bought this a gift, only to find that during set up that the iPhone had already been owned by 2 other people with their IDs still hidden in the phone.  Apple support that nothing can be done to remove them from the phone without the password for those accounts - clearly that is never going to happen.  So I am now going to have to take this gift back and send it back to Amazon.  Hardly Christmas.  Completely unacceptable.	0
review after 2 monththe iphone xs overall doesnt really have much new except the full screen and with fingerprint over the screen. the phone runs smooth so far  just like other iphones i got before. but i know it will slow later on and with full storage problem probably. so far so happy with it. the battery can last slightly longer than my iphone 8 but not much.a friend of mine bought a huawei p20 at black Friday while i bought the iphone, his phone runs great so far and ive tried as well, both of the phone are really similar however huawei p20 got a better camera.the price ive paid for the iphone is double compare to my friends one, i do recom the price for the iphone is too expensive nowday, so value for money i would only gonna to rate 1 star	0
The phone is overheating after a little use. Need to get it looked at because this should not be happening to a £900+ phone.	0

Received the iPhone X 6 days ago already had to replace the charger and had nothing but problems internally as well as with the screen. A trip to apple is a must.	0
I got an iPhone x at Xmas but began using it two weeks ago. On the second morning 15 mins after taking it off the overnight charge, the phone froze with the little spinning wheel in the middle of the screen. It rebooted itself, a process that took 10 minutes. It did the same on the second, third and fourth day, then on the fifth it did not reboot and the screen was totally unresponsive. Calls would still come in and the phone would buzz but not ring but could not be answered. Took it back to Vodafone and they replaced it.The same thing happened with the replacement and Vodafone admitted that they were experiencing similar problems all over the place. In fact the call centre lady said they must have received a bad batch and she herself had just decided to go for an alternative to the iPhone X. I happened to be in London on Saturday and took my dud phone to the Apple store in Covent Garden. Technician ran diagnostics which showed a power failure and he admitted that they were having serious issues. he kindly replaced the phone there and then.It is now Monday and horror of horrors the little spinning wheel showed up this morning, with the phone rebooting itself. I guess it will happen again tomorrow and on Thursday/Friday it will be dead again, just like the other two.The brand is getting damaged. Very expensive phone to buy that has a major screen issue. Can still use it for accessing the internet on my iPad!! The good thing is that it gets replaced with no issues and I could now write the manual on how to transfer data across from my old phone. Come on Apple we deserve a better product for this price.	0
I haven’t even had the phone for two weeks and the battery goes flat very quickly, I have contacted the seller to return the phone and they will not respond. I have contacted Apple who told me that I have to contact the seller, and amazon told me I have to contact apple. It’s very unfortunate this has happened with me and I do not want to keep the phone. It’s best to buy straight from Apple.	0
Thought I was buying an iPhone x but it came back a bag of pennies.. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!	0
Order this iPhone for a gift and it look like it have been used  and now have one unhappy person as still waiting for another one sent out	0
So I have only used the phone around work and messed with it and at face value it's a pretty decent smartphone. But I work for a mobile company on the phones doing tech support and I have never faced so many repairs and insane issues for a phone in my life. Motherboard overheating within a month, screen repairs being £280 with other damages up to £556, camera lens after camera lens cracking, iris scanner not working and if Apple can't repair your phone in warranty you don't even get a new one you get a refurbished one. Avoid this phone at all costs please, it is a waste of money just try an S9 out or even the new Huawei (Hew-Way) phones are doing it on par with less issues and less cost.	0
not the seller's fault but the phone battery caught fire. apple replaced it	0
The IPhone was doing well up untill the 6S and was beating Samsung but not any more...Apple are verry good business people and could stick there name on anything and people would still buy it like the Air Pods! See just buy removing the headphone Jack they want you to spend more of your money.The question you are wondering ""Is this phone really worth £1000?"" NO IT ISN'T!Here are the reasons why-1) It says it has the best display on a phone yet it isn't as good as Samsung displays from the S7 onwards. Even worse why did they cut some of the screen out for the notch when they should of just placed it above in all black so you atleast get the whole screen when you are watching videos.2/3) Crap Battery life compared to phones half the price of this! Also your gonna constanly need a power bank but that means you can't use headphone when charging so you will have to use bluetooth earphones that won't last as long as normal earphones.4) The dual Camera looks like a rubbish version of Wall-E5) It will slow down next year with an even worse battery meaning you will have to buy another £1000 Phone.If you have sense just don't buy it!	0
Bad	0
As it is an expensive bit of kit I read the description over and over and there is nothing saying it was a refurbished phone .. but when I when to insert my SIM card in there was one already in there ... I just read the questions asked section (and asked the question myself) if they were refurbished or reconditioned phones but that seems to be unanswered throughout.. very disappointed. I will be chasing for an answer and taking this further.	0
Sold me a faulty product and don’t want to fix it. The phone is literally falling apart ( screen popping out, mirroring, people are unable to hear my calls and voice notes and the side button doesn’t work. ) if I could give stars I would .	0
When you call someone using the normal speaker it consistently cuts out every few seconds. Call quality is much improved on speaker phone however this is not practical!	0
This was supposed to be an unlimited cord phone but it is locked- not cool	0
It started off working OK, but within hours the screen locked and the 'waiting circle' log in the middle of a black screen kicked in....and ran for 12 hours during which time I couldn't do anything - no restart/shutdown option. So it is going back. Very disappointed in Apple, I thought that their product quality was one thing you could depend on! I was switching back to Apple as I couldn't get on with Android (Samsung).  So where do I go now?  Maybe I will just get a dumb-phone (Nokia) - I used to like the one I had in the 90s.	0
I swaped this for mt samsung s8 and it was like downgrading 4 years	0
Crap	0
The fone never worked properly from the start, then it started clearing things it shuldnt have dun. I am in the possess of returning it.	0
I bought this as a gift for my son who wanted an iPhone because of peer pressure. My phone (S8) is way better and less than half the price!	0
no problem black its good	0
Unfortunately despite the phone being brand new and in excellent shape, once i charged and set it up, the phone overheated immediately and was shocked at just how hot it was and it hadn't even been used yet! It would and could be seriously dangerous and a fire hazard to leave it in a room without keeping eye on it.  Pointless to have a phone that will be too hot to hold, use or keep in a handbag.	0
This is wht I’ve revived it’s not an I phone 8	0
I got and it was rubbish the screen was broke and so was the camera.And the bad thing is that now I can return it what a waste of my moneyI’m applaud I want a new one now!	0

Bad phone	0
Would never buy again	0
Can’t leave a review as didn’t receive but heard it’s a good phone took ages and a lot of complaints to get a refund	0
The phone is great but be aware of few sellers. Many of the Iphones sold here with replaced screen,camera or some other parts. You wont normally notice until you compare with other genuine one. If you have bought one, I strongly recommend you to double check.	0
I have had the phone for 4 weeks and already the speaker has broke. I have had to send the phone Back to you for repair. I have lost loads of work due to this and have also had to pay out £60 to repair an old phone so I am not without a phone. An absolute joke!	0
DIDNT WORK, RETURNED THEN NOT REFUNDED BY AMAZON,	0
Buyers beware. Really disappointed. Faulty speakers and people can’t hear me talk! What’s the point?!	0
Bought a used/renewed iPhone 7 in December. I knew the phone wasn't going to be perfect, especially for the price - but there is a small crack on the left hand side near the bottom. It's also severely scratched. My iPhone 6 I've had for 4 years is in far better condition, so the phone has clearly not been looked after. Battery capacity was at 87% when I got it, its now 85% but I haven't had any issues yet. I probably should have returned the phone when I got it, and somewhat regret it now.  But I suppose it does the job, and the touch screen and everything work with no issues.	0
didnt work	0
Ever since I’ve got this phone had a problem with it keeps on freezing not working speaker not working sold me a damaged phone	0
This phone goes through roughly five-day periods of not charging at all, and every time I attempt to contact the company regarding this (bearing in mind that the product supposedly comes with a '12 month guarantee' and I bought it in August 2018) they do not reply. Do not buy from this company.	0

New phone ordered Friday, arrived Tuesday, and appears to be genuine and new, happy with all that. However after opening I noticed a sheet in the package stating that the phone will work with any network but once a SIM card is inserted the phone is then forever locked to that network, going on to say that if you are not happy with that then send back for full refund. That information should be in the description before purchase not a surprise on opening. And in any case I had already opened the phone. That is not what is generally understood by 'SIM free' and the answers to the questions that have been asked do not mention this locking so definitely deliberately holding back information. Nul points from me.	0
Received item,  doesn't power on	0
This iphone lokcs on the first sim you use.	0
I am beginning to find that the IOS controls and configurations are getting increasingly and unnecessarily convoluted and complicated, and therefore counter intuitive and counter productive. The phone is also very expensive. All in all, rather dissapointed and will be switching to Android soon.	0

I'm sufficiently sad to have had every iPhone model that's come out - and am no fan of Android phones at all. But...the iPhone 7 simply isn't worth it. I have an iPhone 6 for work so can do head-to-head comparisons. Now maybe it's because the uk iPhone 7 has the apparently rubbish intel chip, but the 6 outperforms the 7 significantly in two key respects - mobile signal reception and wifi reception. I park the two phones next to each other and while the 7 struggles to get signal, the 6 is happily connected.Whatever else a smartphone is meant to do, making phone calls and going online is where it all starts from and in this respect the 7 is a  wry expensive fail. The camera however is superb, can't begin to say how much better the pictures are - a real step forward in quality.But for the basics, the 7 doesn't live up to its price tag and I find myself having to use the 6 on frequent occasions (travel a lot for work) because the 7 is floundering. Can't deny that although I will probably be in the queue when the 8 comes out I feel really let down by the 7.Yes, it's waterproof too but given my absentminded habit of giving my phones regular rides in the washing machine, I'm not sure it's that waterproof. The 7 is a bit like visiting an Apple Store at the weekend - it looks fantastic but is ultimately totally frustrating because you can't get any service.	0
My first (and last) iphone: a lot of money for the most overrated phone! Average hardware specs with very limiting (& spying) software. Buying this iPhone makes you really feel like an iDiot. If you are looking for quality without the (many) apple software limitations and extortionate price then do yourself a favor and buy an Android.	0
I don't like the color rose gold. I searched whole phone to find gold color, which I didn't find. I am very frustrated and annoyed with this rose-noGold. And no-apple too.	0
First phone lasted only a couple of months before starting to go faulty. First screen kept flashing, then the earpiece went faulty. Took almost a week to get replacement from the seller.Second handset came, some sort of sim tray fault. Absolute waste of time, went and got one from the high steet at full price instead.There was zero apple warranty with telephonesonline. Its their own in house repair so I would certainly think twice before purchasing especially if you value your time.	0
This item had to be returned to the seller as it was as not advertised - it was described as unlocked to any network but the phone was locked to EE who were unable to assist in unlocking it as I was not the person who orignally took the contract and I was unable to use it - given the runaround - very frustrating	0
The phone I received is out of order. Microphone and speaker, that is, the phone doesn’t work! It opens very slowly and has many issues, obviously reşated to the motherboard.I bought it during a touristic visit in UK, and don’t know how to return it back!	0
total crap packed up after two months!!!	0
What good can I said about this phone, well the iPhone 7 comes certify water or splash proof something I disagreed, some days ago my phone felt on the sink and unfortunately broken up I’m trying to recovery with rice techniques... but I have doubts about it the phone start flashing on apple logos and seems not turn on... the device not water proof or splash proof is made by cheap material and cannot give the protection that they wish for shame on apple selling product very expensive and not lasting longer...	0
Very dissapointed. Product poorly described, as it only says SIM free but it is actually locked EE. That information should be disclosed before buying the product.	0
Not worthy of consideration when there are much better phones available at lower prices now. OnePlus 6T or Pocophone F1 ae decent alternatives that beat this old thing out of the park. If you want to pay 2019 prices for a 2015 device get this!	0
Doesn't have audio jack. Cannot use supplied headphones when the phone is on charge without buying additional accessories. Accessories are overpriced.	0
unfortunately the SIM was not supported ,,What should i do now ?	0
OK	0
Just compare it to samsung s8 plus and see the huge difference in features. Absolutely not worth that amount of money, it is even bad to call it a smartphone.	0
You cannot charge your phone and use your headphones in the same time . Poor designers	0
This phone is the biggest load of garbage I've had. All that's this phone does is freeze, turn off and won't come back on after. And when It eventually comes back on after it turning itself off, it takes ages to come back on. I genuinely wouldn't buy this, I'd wait for the iPhone 7s or iPhone 8 to come out. You might get a better quality phone then.	0
Do not buy rejected phones from apple! they are fraud garbage!	0
I thought I was buying a new iPhone 7 Plus for the money paid. I didn’t receive a plug and charging cable or headphones although there were gaps in the box for them. The box itself was stuck with sellotape. Very disappointed indeed.	0
Received with the camera not working properly - it was third party camera. After repair still not happy because the device had third party glass covering camera. Refund was paid but not for signed for (I sent the device twice).	0

it is awful condition and it said on the listing it is acceptable ????? I don't see that in the pic explains all ....IT IS VERY BAD CONDITION AND NOT ACCEPTABLE !!	0
I received a Motorola instead of an iPhone. Would have given zero stars had that been an option.	0

smashed after less than a day of having it! I suggest buying from an apple shop itself	0
Note working	0
It worked without the SIM card!  It was impossible to make a phone call once theSIM was installed because my server said it was blocked due to it being stolen inNovember 2016.  I was useless.	0
My phone was delivered promptly and packaged as described. The package contained all the items I expected. Superficially the phone is in very good condition indeed. I cannot see any marks or flaws at all. Regrettably the battery life is shockingly poor. New to me on an i phone there is information on battery performance and this phone arrived with 78%, this was its optimum performance capability. In reality that means I am getting less than two hours usage between charges which is not good by any standard, given this is a refurbished phone it would have been useful for such vital information to be included in the advert. I am now forced to obtain a new battery which makes the initially attractive cost of this phone greater than I had hoped. An almost perfect product ruined through lack of information by the seller.	0
Very disappointed,received unblocked phone but didn't work with existing SIM,Tried two more different network Sims and still no joy,returned phone to be told the engineer has Found a manufacturer fault,should not have been sold to me faulty.	0
This Replacement for a dead on arrival Apple phone was also dead on arrival. After much chasing by myself with both Amazon and Apple neither Apple or Amazon could help with my suggestion that somebody check the stock of these phones as it would seem that there could be a faulty batch in circulation. I had to come up with my own solution, which was to order a different colour phone and return the replacement. The different colour phone works. Again not impressed with support from Amazon or Apple	0
New phone, in sealed box came scratched.	0
I've owned the iphone 5, iphone 5s and now the 6s. Each phone gets worse.Usually after an update the device will slow down!It often claims i have 4G or im connected to wifi, yet still nothing on any app works (internet wise)I constantly miss notifications because of this. My last iphone did the same after a year.apply used to be ahead, now they just mug off customers.I have to admit, I still love the touch screen over any other devices on the market. but it's not worth it.	0
I ordered this as I needed an urgent replacement for my existing phone.  I was going to buy second hand but so many reviews said people were having problems with these that I thought I would go for a new one. The phone arrived later than originally advertised and then.. nothing.  Tried to switch it on - nothing.  Charged it, charges it some more, tried a reset, tried everything - it just didn’t work.  So ended up having to return it, and do without the replacement phone I urgently needed	0
Now I’ve been using the phone for a little while, I find myself changing the original review. This phone keeps needing to be rebooted. Very disappointed with it. None of my previous iphones had this problem.	0
The item was listed as being the Plus (bigger) version. I’ve send it back and Amazon sent me another non Plus version. I’ve send it back again and bought the Plus version, the one I was looking for, elsewhere.	0
Terrible quality. Would not recommend at all. A month or two after using, the phone would turn off randomly all the time. Battery is clearly very faulty. Nowadays battery life literally lasts 2-3 hours. Such a joke, now I am stuck with this iPhone that I bought for a lot of money.	0
I got this phone as a free upgrade and it lasted 4 days before I sent it back. First thing I did was upgrade to iOS 10.3. I work on the road and my phone is everything. I installed hear maps which I always used on my s5. Voice navigation did not work. Installed Google maps, voice navigation worked for 30 minutes and only when I was on the exact route. Set a course for London from Ipswich it completely failed. Notifications had no sounds most of the time. I tried calling my provider and selecting the options on the ivr , selecting the numbers on the phone did nothing. Getting an s7 now. Like buying an Alfa, blinded by beauty but rubbish reliability under the bonnet. Never again.	0
ok frist one do not work thank god for apple for repairing  this	0
Waiting to hear from seller , even though volume up highest it goes I can’t hear the people very well on the other end of phone. Something wrong with speaker . Also I just noticed it said free plug free sim key and free cleaning cloth but all that was inside the box was free sim key . Really dissapointed considering the other reviews I expected much better .	0
Was not as described....was locked to a network despite description saying sim freeThe phone was lovely though !	0
it was crap	0

The most expensive POS to come out of Apple. It’s a $200 phone for $1000 bucks. If took the same money and put it towards a great camera you would have a professional camera and could buy a simple phone. Apple has duped us once again. By far the worst apple purchase I have made. My last time I buy a phone from this overindulgent company that puts more thought into its packaging than its products. Basically the overpriced less impressive model that Starbucks and Apple have milked us for for years. Learning that Apple no longer is innovative...it follows an ever growing pack of cheaper, more stylish competitors.	0

I purchased this xs to replace my 6 plus. Once I got it home, I noticed it would not hook up to cellular data. I also noticed that I had to swipe it two or three times or more to get it to open up. The facial recognition was very slow and sometimes wanted the pass code entered.  When I went to reset it, I couldn’t get it too shut down. It felt like the on off button was not connecting properly. Went back to the store, and the tech went through the same things I did with no success. They wanted me to go outside the store and try the cellular data. I did that with no success. It would make calls and text, but not send or receive photos or data.I decided right then and there, after using 2 hours of my time, I was going return this defective device. I need more reliable equipment for use in my business. I’m a pilot. After paying $1000 plus for it, I was disappointed. I will reactivate my 6 plus, which never let me down, and then consider all other options. They offered to replace the phone with a refurbished unit, or send it in for repair. But since it’s brand new, I can return it per the store policy. I Just don’t feel good about how this has worked out but definitely don’t want to keep this 10s.	0
We purchased this phone through a Verizon trade in.  By far, the worst upgrade in my 10-year history of Apple Phones.  Not only did I lose 65% of all the songs I painstakingly burned and created playlists for, but the headphones end connector has changed as well .  It is non-universal so you will not be able to use the new headphones on planes or other devices like tablets or computers. The music I lost wasn’t pre-cloud.  Nevertheless, Apple Support was very nonchalant about this loss.  They say they are “pushing” all users to subscribe to Apple Music!  Shame on you, Apple!  We’re switching to another product.	0

I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6, which I had no issues with at all, other than it being antiquated. In fact, I loved the phone and all of the features. I'll make this review easy by simply listing the pros and cons.Pros:-Waterproof (allegedly)-Larger screen and better graphics-Better camera quality than ever beforeCons:-Insanely expensive-Facial recognition is not that great. It works about 70% of the time and doesn't work randomly, for unknown reasons-The processor is supposed to be faster but it is constantly lagging when using apps and I'm nowhere close to capacity-With the home button gone, you have to swipe up from the bottom to close apps. This is problematic when using certain apps because I often inadvertently swipe up (when playing a game, for instance) and close the app-The battery life is supposed to be better than previous models, however I don't notice a difference. The phone also takes a bit longer to fully charge	0

I got the iPhone XS and returned it 3 hrs. later. I'm a filmmaker by trade and thought this could be a breakthrough in filmmaking especially with a high-end 4k camera on board. I got the phone home anxiously opened it up and went to the camera functions right away since that's all I care about, a phone is just a phone otherwise. Well, I shot some 4k footage, looked nice but now I need to see how creative I can get. I looked for the manual shutter speed control, there isn't one. I looked for the manual white balance, there isn't one. I looked. I looked for the manual ISO setting, not there. I looked for the manual aperture setting, doesn't have it. So basically its camera is not intended for any kind of production, it's really a point and shoot. The HDR feature is nice but again, no manual settings. Not production friendly at all. 3 hours later I repacked it and returned it and got the LGV40. Now I'll do a review on that as well but the IPhone XS doesn't even come close to the LGV40 in any shape or form.	0
I just got my first iPhone ever, and Ive had it for over a month...and its TERRIBLE!-phone volume controls all sound, including alarms, ringtones, media and any bluetooth device youre connected to. horrible setup. especially if you want the Alarm you have set to wake you up, but dont want phone calls or messages to bother you. and for the bluetooth this is really frustrating because you cant use the full volume range of the speaker without distortion of the sound, because you cant balance the input volume to the speaker with the playback volume.-touch response is terrible. about half the time I try scrolling up, the phone scrolls left to the previous page or screen. rather frustrating, and just plain annoying-battery life okay, but not great, especially if youre actually using the phone, it dies fast-camera takes amazing photos, AS LONG AS YOU ARE VIEWING THEM ON AN APPLE SCREEN, as soon as you display them on anything else, its just another photo from a phone camera- no expandable storage? oh thats right, so they can sell me cloud storage thats so clearly easy to hack...no thanks- lots of other pointless and not intuitive operation methods, like, to edit an alarm, you have to select edit, then the alarm, and to edit another, you gotta go back up and hit edit again....why design this way? zero user fluidity...ALSO, wanna click on the notification to open it? nah, you gotta slide to right to open and left for other operations, or slide it up for a faster go away response, which is the same as swipe left option, so again redundant, non-fluid operation that could easily be designed another way.My first iPhone will be my last. I gave it some time, but this entire setup and function design is really far from intuitive or fluid. I finally truly realize why everyone I know in program engineering or computer science has an Android.I know theyre popular, but like...The united states is literally known in part for its poor education and stupidity...no wonder this country loves this phone!!!	0
This is the fourth iPhone I have had and by far the worst. This is the first time I have purchased a new iPhone and not been happy with the changes/improvements they made.  Them getting rid of the home button is a monumental mistake, that’s what really set iPhone apart before. Phone has good battery life and I like the camera features but would’ve been happy just to keep my iPhone 7.	0
Trae que esta totalmente desbloqueado pero no es asi.	0

Bought my XS from Apple direct and love mostly how it operates, but there’s one main thing that sucks, the data reception reliability, sometimes it’ll refuse to work even in places where I usually get good reception like 70/80 download speeds, I assume this is because Apple decided to go in fight with Qualcomm and have inferior Intel modems	0
Poca tecnología y mucho dinero	0
it was broken and it didn't work when I took it to the apple store they couldn't fix it	0
El teléfono decía que estaba desbloqueado. Cuando lo recibí lo probé y no fue asi	0
La descripción estaba mal. No está desbloqueado.	0
I had an iPhone 6 Plus. Which was the big one. So I got the iPhone XS MAX on purpose. I wanted the big one (because I use it a lot for mobile film making & photography). I expected to be extremely happy with my new phone. The camera(s) are supposed to be very good. Now the report: The camera(s) are indeed great. BUT: The microphones on this model are abysmal. Very bad. It is a real issue, frequently discussed in on-line forums. Only I did not learn about it until after the purchase. Voices sounds muffled and unnatural, both receiving and accepting calls. But not all the time. The second severe downside is the weight of the iPhone XS MAX. It is 1.2 oz heavier than the old Plus 6. A BIG minus, though it seems small. It is also thicker. Very clunky and unhandy. It feels truly old-fashioned in one's hands. Not sleek. There is no joy in actually handling this baby. A very, very misguided and unattractive design for end-users.  I am returning the iPhone XS MAX. No wonder, Apple had to lower the price for the XS series in China. They have much more modern phones there. PS.: I am an Apple fan. I have all devices Apple. But this is a serious dud.	0
Do not buy! I’ve been an active frequent user of amazon prime. I’m very  disappointed the phone does not work. It’s been charging for hours no, light no nothing. I’m not sure if it has to sit an charge a whole day. Ima let it do that, & if nothing else works back it goes!!!! What a waste of money!!!! Don’t buy if you don’t wanna lose any money	0
Defective it doesn't take charge at all I was using the phone and then a black screen accrued very disappointed it's only a week I had the phone  didn't even make two weeks	0
This phone is locked phone. I thought it was unlocked. It requires to have simple mobile plan for 1 year to make it unlocked -_-	0
Phone is cheaply made and too big. Last apple I buy.	0
I bought it, and all I got was a piece of paper with a picture of it. EXPLAIN THAT AMAZON!	0
So at first glance I thought, great deal....750 for a XR. But I didn't read the fine print, its locked to one provider. Probably the stupidest idea, and might be illegal. So I returned it and bought a XR at my local Cellphone store. Buy it if you are a T-mobile customer....forever..	0
When got it it was broken and did not work very didupinted	0
Do not buy iPhone x.  I bought it back on November 2017 and now, it stop working.  Let me put it this way, when Steve jobs running the company, the products were much better.  Very, very disappoint about apple.  I would give 0 star if I can.	0
Overpriced	0
it's literary the same as the other old iphones	0

No SIM card was included. Finally got a SIM from carrier and the phone has to be power cycled numerous times to even make a call. Should have just went to carrier for the phone.	0
The phone came with T-Mobile chip and blocked by its carrier. Behind a hard time convincing them to renove some stupid code. May have to return it.  Very frustrated!	0
This product is not compatible with my telephone carrier.  Very inconvenient..	0

The phone was received locked but simple moble says it is not in their system so they cannot unlock it	0
This works with a SIMPLE MOBIL PLAN ONLY!!!!!!!!!!	0
Ordered this with the intention of using it right away. I have other devices that run Simple Mobile and as soon as I put in this SIM card it wouldn't register. I had to call Simple Mobile and they verified my line was perfectly fine, I could not get the SIM card to function properly. Stay away from this listing. As you can see, the reviews aren't very good for a reason. I certainly learned my lesson. Will be returning for a refund. Very unhappy with this purchase.	0
Got a phone yesterday and tried to set up. Sprint said it is not compatible with their network. So frustrated I waited for an unusable phone.	0

This phone is not GSM unlocked as it says in the product heading. Please read the fine print in ""Features and Details"" where it states phone is carrier locked on SIMPLE Mobile. It will NOT work with your existing Sim from T-Mobile or any other carrier. Aside from that the phone was in pristine condition; too bad I had to send it back.	0
Hace unos días que compré el celular y cuando empecé a configurarlo para utilizarlo en la compañía de mi país, Uruguay, me aparecio el mensaje de SIM no válida.  Éste celular no es desbloqueado!!!! No es como dice el detalle del producto!!!! Copio una imagen para que vean que lo que compré era un teléfono desbloqueado cuando en realidad no lo es! No lo compren! Es un engaño y pérdida de dinero!	0
This phone is not unlocked .. do not buy if you want to put your SIM card in !!	0
Folks,FYI the black model shipped and sold by amazon.com is NOT unlocked as stated in the title. See further down in the details it states it’s locked to Simple Mobile. I received mine yesterday and even tried to activate with Mint Mobile, which is another T Mobile MVNO. No go. It had the Simple Mobile Sim and instructions glued to the back of the box also.Just a heads up for others. Thanks.	0
All, @Amazon is cheating here. This product is not unlocked but locked. I talked to their customer service department and they had no clue about this and kept on saying that it unlocked. After spending 60 minutes, they accepted and mentioned that there is a small disclaimer somewhere about using the service of simple mobile. Ridiculous customer service and misleading information.	0
I was very excited to buy this phone for my mom and of course I did my research because she lives in Bulgaria. it turns out my research was based on false information. a couple of days after I got it the description of the product changed but I at least I have a proof that I bought it for unlocked iPhone 7 plus	0
This phone was advertised as unlocked and after purchase then it reads... locked to Simple Mobile.  Do not buy this phone if you're looking for an unlocked phone. Even though I was duped into buying this phone Simple Mobile require you to use it on their network for 12 months before they will unlock it.  Such a waste . I cannot use it and Simple Mobile will not budge.	0
This product was horrible, was promised 100%  guarantee only for me to receive the phone and let’s just say it all went left. But! The company was great with helping me fix the problem and for that 2.5 stars	0
So I bought this phone for myself this Christmas holiday since my 6s was running extremely show...the phones shopping was extremely fast which I loved but as soon as I started to use the phone it turned off on me and wouldn’t turn on again I  tried everything but nothing worked I shipped back to get a refund..	0
I ordered this phone with the understanding that it was factory unlocked and i would be able to carry it to any carrier. Upon opening my package, it instructed me to enter a sim card from simple mobile in order to activate my service. I did not want to switch phone companies.	0
The listing of this item says ""Unlocked"" but I can tell you that's 100% a lie! It is locked to Simple Mobile. Do not trust this item's title!	0
NO COMPREN!! Es un engaño, no sirve. En la página dice desbloqueado pero después cambia y es totalmente bloqueado. Me siento estafado. Amazon debería responder ante tantas quejas y darnos reembolso	0

I bought this telephone for my husband.  It did not state that the phone was locked, the description was changed after I bought it.  I gave it to my husband for Christmas and he just today took it down to have it activated.  I am going to see what I can do to dispute this charge.	0

The phone lags and heats up for no reason.... I dont think the phone is smart enough to handle the fastest processor on the market! Sorry and it's waaayy too overpriced..... If I'm going g to pay this much I might as well purchase the Pixel Xl	0
The phone is normally brand new, nothing special. But I have required for orginal receipt twice, and seller can't even provide any proof of the purchase of this iPhone.	0
To all you that read the reviews you might as well buy on Apple cause it’s 569 for the phone and like 606 and some change which is better than getting ripped off or even buying a more expensive one	0
Muy malo no es desbloqueado deberían de remover este producto por que es falso	0
No sirve lla tiene 2 meses q lo compre no carga 😑	0

I bought this phone as unlocked to work with different carriers when I travel. Today I have just received it and boom... The first thing it says is ""this phone must be activated on SIMPLE Mobile Service"" I'm not in the US. I'm in the Dominican Republic. This is a scam. It's not an unlocked clean IPhone.	0
I ordered this product as factory unlocked as Christmas Gift for my daughter but my surprise was to discover that it isn’t unlocked. I need a change for an unlocked one or a refund.	0

The worst iPhone ever! I got it today and I am going to return it tomorrow. No jack for headphones, the home button is awful, the sound is awful, I hate everything about it, just the camera is cool, but that doesn't justify the price. Is it the decline of Apple?	0
It's not really a button, is it? 2/5	0

This IPhone is Locked. I can’t use yed. How I can do ?	0
Bought this model via Verizon. A piece of junk. Headphone setting woouldn’t release.  Apple couldn’t solve the problem, Apple Store replaced the phone.  Just past rhe 90 day warrantee, same problem returned. Apple Store offered $300+ examination, especially as the dial pad was now generating error messages. There is no sure remedy, however. N fact, as a knowledgeable tech guy, I found Apple’s approach and evaluation superficial, definitely NOT confidence-building. The phone still doesn’t work. A multi-hundred dollar piece of junk. You’d be nuts to buy this phone and, I suspect, any iPhone. You pay more upfront and you pay more in the longer run.  Unless you get lucky with your Chinese gear. I use an Android phone and I am sorely tempted to get a Google Book instead of a Mac. What a ripoff.	0
Simply a phone for the black of course is pre paid	0
Just garbage	0
