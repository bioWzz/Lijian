iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Fireball3	1	After a year sudden device dead	2018-09-14	de	About a year ago I bought my wife an iphone 7 with 128GB. The said mobile phone looks through the careful use until today as new. Nonetheless, the phone suddenly became boiling hot (source of danger) and has stopped working since then. The warranty expired a few weeks ago - and goodwill is a foreign word at Apple. For a mobile phone that only lasts for one year and is almost injured, the price is in no way justified. We will turn our backs on Apple after this experience and get a device with better value for money - prestige is not everything in life! However, until the said day, the mobile phone has worked well, albeit no better than comparable competing products.	0

iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	FcBayernGrafBecker	1	Ugly, cheap and itunes heavy!	2015-10-17	de	Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	M. Benz	3	Sorry, not happy! Round display on the corners - nothing for gamers and video gobblers!	2017-11-03	de	My colleague is Applefan and has gotten the great IPhoneX. I had the model up to version 5S and then I had to let it stay. Now for the test of the Iphone X: It makes a solid impression, but I have to say the homebutton Apple fans very much miss. Why? Because the facial recognition is very bad. I have to hold the phone as high as if I were using a women's mirror! When driving, that probably everyone sees and the police can equal to the luxury owners at the price once again give a hefty penalty. Have fun with Apple Enthusiasten.Naja, I'm a little disappointed. The camera is once again set to the outside and that has once again very much supported me, even with the model Iphone 6 I was a thorn in the eye and that's why I had used only to Iphone 5, the prestige device. People design looks different. Here would have let me run from the times Karl Lagefeld as a designer should.Was I have probably bought? I stick with Huawei P10 and have to say that here the design for the Apple is much nicer and the camera is not so unprofessional outward. In addition I have to say that the Huawei has installed a GERMAN CAMERA OF LEICA -WAU-- the pictures are as sharp and detail rich as if you were live. OK Apple tries to follow the German with the China or Japan lens. However, from my point of view, this is far too expensive and not justified for the device. Just compare the Huawei device and you'll be amazed why the device is in no way inferior in quality and quality. Even the display was better before than Apple. Now Apple has even installed Samsung as a display technology and even demands more than Samsung! This is sad. Of course you can pay 80% more for the pure name in the name of Apple, but that is over soon, as with the premium car manufacturers or in the shopping markets. :-) So do not make such a hype about a smartphone that will soon cost more than a high-end gaming PC!	0

iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	IP	1	Scrap screen and overpriced	2016-03-29	de	It is a nice mobile phone with a nice design. The software is quite good and has only crashed once. But the price of the phone (then 800 euros) is extremely overpriced. The added value I see here (with the exception of the camera) not. Because with a cheap HTC or Blackberry is just as clear and that costs less than half. Naughty the price but in the face of the shabby screen. Once dropped on the ground, a nice thick crack is visible. At Apple I was told that I should have attached a cover. At 800 euros I would have thought that the material is now a bit more resistant (in the iPhones 1 and 2, almost every second copy was affected by this deficiency). Even my cheap Blackberry, which I had used before, flew to the ground every week and nothing happened. In the future I will refrain from joining this hipster mania to enjoy a minimalistic scrap with a maximailistic crack. The next time I scrape together 800 euros, I'll rather buy 800 cheeseburgers at McDonald's - or 450 cheeseburgers plus 1 Blackberry. Then I'm not so hip, but at least survive the next hunger period and at least can still look at the scratch-free cheap screen of Blackberry.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	Loris	1	Worst iPhone I've ever owned	2016-02-14	de	I had an iPhone 4, 2x 4s and a 5s and I have a MacBook Pro and Apple TV is so familiar with Apple products and actually appreciate the quality and ease of use of the products. The 6s is the first iPhone, which I am very disappointed. For one, it does not bring any meaningful novelties and bores through it. It's the first iPhone that I do not think wow cool part. That alone would be a pity, of course, but not a real problem. What on the other hand is a problem for me is that after just 4 months makes problems that I know otherwise only from hearsay other smartphones. The battery of the 6s discharges faster than any other iPhone. In one day, the battery has 40% and it just goes out and requires power. On another day, it consumes between 60-80% charge within 6 hours without a charger. Even my 4 year old 4s lasts much longer. As if that was not enough, the 6s has so many software problems, like no other of my iPhones before that. Even a 1/8 Huawei Y550 works better, probably because Steve Jobs is no longer living. The first iPhone after his death, he had probably still been involved or Apple still had ideas of him in the bag, but they seem to be used up. In the meantime, I have the feeling that you only pay for the name at Apple and not the wonderful uniqueness and quality that an iPhone once had. Of course NOT a buy recommendation!	0
iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	mario	3	matter of taste	2017-11-28	de	Three starsWhy? Technique, equipment and the certain step to be ahead of the others earn 5 points. I have been an iPhone user for several years now and I am thrilled with that. However, I like to leave the exact test reports to people who seem to have their own test lab at home. For the price ...... Wienn I buy at launch the top mobile phone of the competition and to a top memory card with 256 GB, then I am on an equal footing financially. If I sell a cell phone of the competition after two years, then maybe I get 200 euros. I sell an iPhone after two years, then I get half and more. Now that ..... and that's my own tasteThe missing home button and the display are for me an absolute nogo.Beim display I do not mean the technology , Rather, I mean the look. The display looks like a screen protector. On the left and right higher than in the middle, I personally do not like that at all. That's why I decided against the x and the 8plus.	0
iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Kyoshi	4	Not revolutionary but a good smartphone anyway	2017-10-10	fr	A good smartphone but nothing revolutionary.That's the summary of reviews in general.So ... Not where to start? Often considered a simple evolution of the iPhone 7 (aesthetic very close except the glass back of the latest model), the iPhone 8 brings a few changes: - Faster (thanks to the A11 chip) - Better photo processing (you will find several tests on the net) - Compatible with the Qi charge ... And this is the novelty. Indeed, you can now charge the iPhone by putting it on a charger Qi ... No need to connect the iPhone.The nice thing also is that the memory capacity starts at 64gb (64gb or 256gb in fact). ... Despite this little change, the iPhone 8 (Plus) is a very good phone and we find the qualities of the brand.The screen is very good, the overall finish is very good, powerful and made beautiful photos (Obviously ... Accustomed to SLR ... Difficult to judge a smartphone on it ... But to troubleshoot, I find it convenient). Autonomy is good from the comparisons that we find ... Sorry ... I do not buy an array of Smartphone to compare:) ... Although I am amazed at the autonomy of my Samsung A5 2016 job that I only charge twice in the week (except for Cisco Spark and checking mails ... The use is only by telephone). Speaking of battery life ... The battery capacity is down compared to the iPhone 7 but it is obviously inconsequential ... Good ... For those who know the developments Apple, you will know that there is more to jack jacks (but the adapter is provided ... note that it can not be used wired). Several other brands have followed the movement ... Even Google who have made fun of Apple on this point ... By cons ... the iPhone 8 Plus is a heavyweight office compared to its competitors.If I compare the iPhone 8 Plus (offered to my wife) and my OnePlus 3T ... We feel the difference.Why so few changes? Just because of the iPhone X that will be released soon to write these lines.Quelles differences? Here is what I selected (in favor of the iPhone X of course): - Better screen resolution - Screen that occupies the entire surface before (or almost) - Facial identification.A still note for this last point, what the facial recognition of the iPhone X has nothing to do with that of the last Samsung that you can unlock with a simple photo (bravo security). Indeed, if I do not say nonsense, he There are 30000 IR control points on the iPhone X ... So, if you are in the dark, you put glasses or change your cuts, it will work (theoretically for now ... seen apart at the Keynote where we saw it in action ... And again ... There was a loupé ...). So ... Buy or not this iPhone 8 (Plus)? Ben ... Clearly, if you already have an iPhone 7 (More) ... The interest is minimalThe Smartphone is very expensive ... Damn ... 900 € !!! Well ... It is true that given the time that people spend above ... It's prorated more profitable than a lot of other things.The Smartphone remains a recurring budget for more and more people.The real question will remain ... iOS (the Apple system) or Android (a huge choice and for all budgets)? These are two different philosophies ... For my part, we chose an iPhone (and more specifically iOS) when: - we want to be quiet with a stable system - we want a smartphone turnkey without having to search right and left this or that application - we want to keep a system up to date (with Apple, when a new version of iOS comes out ... The update is available on all iPhone versions at the same time time...Except for the models of 5 years ago) - it does not necessarily hack his phone (easier on Android). I have the following iPhones: EDGE / 3GS / 5 / 5S and my wife the 4 or the 4S.This works ... Never had any particular problem (small bugs exist but it is rare and does not last) .Good, the only thing that can be boring is that we do not really feel to change the phone from one iPhone to the other. There are of course several improvements systems, etc ... A better responsiveness and everything ... But the system itself remains the same.On may be trying to go elsewhere ... But we are not necessarily conquered elsewhere ... My wife went on a OnePlus One after her iPhone ... She is not a fan of Android at all (and the phone has made the soul so good ). It has chained a number of problems ... Two trips / return service ... And more ... Just after the last service, the phone still has a problem ... But since the guarantee was passed and obviously at OnePlus they do not guarantee their repair (which had just been realized ... Two weeks ready) ... Not wanting to fight any longer.She is happy to have an iPhone again.My ... After my iPhone 5S, I went to Android with a OnePlus 3T.Pourquoi? Because of the price ... Do not hide the face.Some things irritated me on Android (to manage several mails ... A pleasant and free client ... Apart from BlueMail who did not always recover my mails automatically ... Pay to have a calendar in CalDAV while it is native on an iPhone, etc ...) but I'm not disappointed either. It's nice to be able for example to manage its downloads as if you were on your computer ... Or to add music without going through an application ... Have dual SIM (to manage the SIM card of work and that perso), etc.I will definitely go back to iOS for my next phone.That's my opinion ... :)	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	Alejandro	4	Is it worth buying it?	2018-10-20	it	* UPDATED * I purchased this new iPhone on the Apple Store online, just to try it out a little, having already an iPhone X; personally, I don't think it's worth buying, if you already have an iPhone X. This is the much-anticipated version "" S "" of the iPhone X. Let's try to understand what changes compared to the previous version and whether it's worth buying or not . Let's start by saying that there are NO big changes compared to the previous device. No news is resounding this year. The S version, as is well known, only goes to improve some aspects. Moreover, unusually, the most expensive and large "" Xs Max "" version has nothing different than the iPhone Xs, except for its size. We do not find more powerful processors or improved cameras. It's just a bigger iPhone Xs with more battery (and power consumption). I will continue to update this review as I use it. DESIGN: The iPhone Xs does not bring significant changes in design, except in the lower part where the symmetry of the holes, having added an additional antenna, to allow an enhanced reception, also given the novelty of the Dual Sim, which will be discussed later. The rear camera has been moved slightly a few millimeters higher, so the covers of the iPhone X will NOT be fully compatible with the new device. This year we also have the Gold variant. The design remains essentially unchanged, this device achieves an IP68 waterproof rating (6 indicates the maximum degree of dust resistance and 8 indicates a degree of impermeability and resistance , in case of contact with liquids, but especially with fresh water, for 30 minutes and a maximum of 2 meters deep). The guarantee of NO manufacturer, recognizes the damage caused by liquids, so it is better to refer to these specifications, considering ONLY soft water, being the liquid that causes less damage. The resistance to water and dust decreases with 'usury.PROCESSOR: The new iPhone Xs features the brand new Bionic A12 processor (retains the same marketing name as the previous A11 Bionic), but is the first smartphone processor to be built at 7 nanometers. It is equipped with 4GB of RAM, compared to the 3GB of the iPhone X, it is always equipped with 6 cores (2 high-performance and 4 high-efficiency), it has a second-generation neural engine (8-core) capable of performing 5000 billions of transactions in a second (against the 600 billion of the A11). The GPU is designed by Apple and has 4 cores against the 3 of the X. The 2 high-efficiency cores are dedicated to everyday operations, such as social media, apps, games. The 4 high-efficiency devices, on the other hand, are designed to save battery power when performing simpler operations such as chats and messages. However, when all the processor power is needed, iOS dynamically calibrates all six cores to deliver incredible performance (same as iPhone X). Thus, while performing heavy apps, such as augmented reality games or video editing, performance will be greatly improved. I do not find significant changes during everyday use compared to X. Probably, it also depends on the new operating system (iOS 12) not yet fully optimized on this new device. Both are very fast in all operations: multitasking, photos and videos, opening the app and, of course, in games .. BATTERY: Rightly, one wonders given the performance, the battery capacity. iPhone Xs is equipped with a 2658mAh battery (against the 2716mAh of iPhone X); iPhone Xs Max, on the other hand, has the largest battery an iPhone has ever had, that is 3174mAh (against the 2691mAh of the iPhone 8 Plus). iPhone Xs has less battery than iPhone X? Yes. Does it last less? At the moment, I have to say that the duration is a little lower than X, but I also think this depends on the software. FACE ID AND CAMERA: As I wrote above, the cameras are the same as the iPhone X, always with wide angle and telephoto lens with aperture focal length respectively of 1/1.8 and 2.4 / 2.4. Despite this, Apple has added some features on the new Xs / Xs Max, in my opinion, for pure marketing. In fact, both these models (but also the new Xr, with single camera, released at the end of October) are able to adjust the depth of field of a photo both before shooting and in post-production and have an advanced bokeh effect . These effects are also possible on the iPhone X via the Focos app, since the cameras are identical. Change the quality of the photos in low light for the better, since the sensor of the camera has larger pixels and, we also have the smartHDR that goes to perform more shots of the same subject, combining the best parts of each shot as a result (light, movement reduction, colors); according to Apple, this, the depth of field and the boken effect are possible thanks to the new processor able to perform more operations. Nothing that the processor of the iPhone X is not able to do, but anyway .. Even the sensors of the Face ID are identical to those of the previous model, but Apple reports an improvement in the algorithm of the Secure Enclave (separate processor to encrypt biometric passwords) which guarantees a faster unlocking, despite not being a second generation Face ID. Honestly, the speed seems to me to be the same as the iPhone X, which thanks to iOS 12 is even faster and more precise in unlocking. I am absolutely satisfied in this sense.DUAL SIM: We pay attention to this very important detail. The 3 new iPhones will NOT have Dual Sim functionality in Italy. This is because it is not possible to insert 2 physical Nano Sims, since the cart can contain only one physics, unlike the Chinese version that will have two. How does this system work? A sim will be physical, the second sim, instead, will be based on the "" Dual Sim Dual Standby "" technology that allows you to simulate the second sim in a virtual way. This is the future, as this system will make it very easy to change the telephone or operator offer. Unfortunately, at the moment, no operator in Italy allows this function. Probably Vodafone will be the first to catch up with this technology, but not for now (also because this feature requires iOS 12.1, for the moment in beta testing). CURRENTLY PRESENT FAULTS: If you have heard of the ChargeGate, know that it has been resolved with iOS 12.0.1 (did not allow reloading if the screen was off). According to some users, there is still a Beauty Gate that applies a sort of "" beauty filter "" automatically to selfies; in this way, the details of the face will be minimally captured, making the face look like that of a barbie. It seems to have been a bug that has just been solved with iOS 12.1. Some users also complain about an Antenna Gate, especially on the Xs Max, with poor reception in 4G / LTE and in WiFi. The WiFi part was resolved with 12.0.1, while the part concerning the antenna was solved with iOS 12.1. Obviously, in the event that this last problem occurs, Apple will replace the device, free of charge. I hope I helped you with the decision or clarified your ideas. If you have any other questions, please write me in the comments! :)	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Alex1282	1	the service...	2016-10-10	de	The iPhone 7 has actually earned 4 to 5 stars, this has been written a lot. However, for me is also a good service for a € 870 mobile phone and Apple can no longer deliver. I had problems with my iPhone and went directly to the Apple service. The error could not be solved even after 3 complaints. The service seemed incompetent and dried up. Again and again, the same phrases of the employees used, without a solution to bring about. Consumer rights regarding the warranty for defects under German law were eroded and ignored. The Apple warranty is a priority, even if I would be better off under the warranty. This is very alarming, as a group over the law and law sets. As I was then more and more acidic by the ignorance of the concrete personnel, one has noticed correctly how the employees have the invisible arrogant "" Apple coat "" dressed and no longer argued goal-oriented. Granted, I was a little upset, too, but rightly so. I never became dropping, offensive or personal. With which arrogance but it has to do with a non-functioning 870 ¬ phone at Apple, is absurd and no longer of this world. By the way, was exactly this service at Apple a few years ago, still exemplary. Today, this is often sluggish and bureaucratized. If Apple does not change here soon with the amount of staff and especially well-trained (professional, non-religious;)) professionals, the case will probably deep in the medium to long term, because then lacks the backing in the fan base, the Apple still has today. One should hire more IT people in the service and no theologians;)	0

You would be foolish if you didn't think a large amount of what you are paying for is branding. Yes - you do get a lot of tech with this. And I find that even though some other phones are technically superior the iPhone seems to run better HOWEVER this is nearly one thousand pounds. That is a big investment - more than a laptop. If you can afford it, it won't disappoint but it's defiantly not that much better than the older versions which are 2/3 of the price.	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	Abe Addler	1	No Manual Functions on Video Camera	2018-10-29	us	I got the iPhone XS and returned it 3 hrs. later. I'm a filmmaker by trade and thought this could be a breakthrough in filmmaking especially with a high-end 4k camera on board. I got the phone home anxiously opened it up and went to the camera functions right away since that's all I care about, a phone is just a phone otherwise. Well, I shot some 4k footage, looked nice but now I need to see how creative I can get. I looked for the manual shutter speed control, there isn't one. I looked for the manual white balance, there isn't one. I looked. I looked for the manual ISO setting, not there. I looked for the manual aperture setting, doesn't have it. So basically its camera is not intended for any kind of production, it's really a point and shoot. The HDR feature is nice but again, no manual settings. Not production friendly at all. 3 hours later I repacked it and returned it and got the LGV40. Now I'll do a review on that as well but the IPhone XS doesn't even come close to the LGV40 in any shape or form.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Gray	🇮🇹 Schälflj 🇮🇹	4	iPhone X or iPhone XR? The sensations of use after the first month, but for me it is still iPhone X	2019-01-21	it	As owners of the dated, although still valid iPhone 6s, in the family we decided to update ourselves and taking advantage of the fact that finally Amazon sells iPhone directly, we purchased an iPhone X and also an XR (see my other review) now often aligned on the sale price under 800 euros (December 2018). By bypassing the technical features that are now easily found on the net, I dwell on the sensations of use after about a month. The iPhone X arrives in its classic original Apple packaging, with the inside HEADPHONE with ligthning connector, the ADAPTER for non-ligthning headphones (that is an accessory that is commercially worth 10 euros but unfortunately does not provide in the XR Apple) and the usual charger; if we want a fast charger or we have it already or we have to buy it. If we already have an iPhone the CONFIGURATION of the new device will be fast and in few minutes we will have our iPhone X operating. Compared to previous generations but also compared to XR, my feeling is that the iPhone X aesthetically has something more, at least in the materials used and in some finishes, obviously if we cover it with a non-transparent cover, the design will camouflage it. As for DIMENSIONS, those of the IPhone X I find them the most correct and balanced; slightly larger than the 6s / 7/8 but with a screen much wider than 5.8 "", but without reaching the 6.1 "" of the XR that, due to the greater width and thickness of the frames is at the limits of the comfort of use with a hand, what is allowed with this iPhone X instead. The OLED SCREEN of the X is still today a great display superior to that of the XR, although comparing it sometimes with the LCD in certain circumstances I almost appreciated that of the model "" economic "" 2018, at least in the shades of white. The Apple technicians in this have done a great job for the 2018 models. The WEIGHT of the iPhone X is still contained and even if we add a cover, we will always remain about twenty grams less than the XR; it may seem little, but if we add the smallest weight to the smaller X dimensions, I find ASSAI more comfortable to call and use the iPhone X with respect to the XR with one hand every day. Regarding the FLUIDITY OF USE, despite the iPhone X processor is one year older and slightly less powerful than the XR one, I can guarantee that the two phones play almost equally. The AUDIO of X (but also of XR) in phone call and also for movies it is more than good, as is the 4G telephone signal and also the WiFi signal.With no particular problems, the fast transition from WiFi to 4G, at least under the Vodafone network. The FACE ID does not miss a beat, in any light condition, even low and almost in any situation. I didn't notice any particular differences with iPhone XR. It is enough to register your face twice as the phone asks for in the initial configuration phase and we will forget the physical button in the past. As for the CAMERA, I state that I am a photography enthusiast and prefer to shoot with my Reflexes. Nikon on which I can change lens as needed, but the camera on the iPhone X still performs well; although in this on the XR despite having a unique camera, they succeeded thanks also to the new HDR SMART and the updated processor, to gain more details and brightness, especially in poor light conditions. On the iPhone X I have not detected the same unpleasant defects as LENS FLARE, or annoying reflections in the presence of artificial lights; I have not really understood if it is a defect of the XR that I received, or is the standard of the model 2018 camera, with the iPhone X BATTERY, if we don't stress the phone too much we should arrive late at night without too much trouble; in this case the XR manages to guarantee a little more autonomy of perhaps a couple of hours, but I think because it simply has the largest battery and an LCD screen that asks for less energy. Therefore evaluating the various pros and cons, at the moment it does not I can promote IPHONE X as a device that I personally find even MORE BALANCED and more COMFORTABLE and MANAGEABLE, especially at the same price with the most recent XR. Perhaps because the XR despite being improved as a processor and camera, for everyday use I still find it too big and heavy and also because comparing them in real time I didn't find all these differences such as to favor the iPhone XR. Another question would be if we chose the iPhone XS, but in this case the costs would rise more than appreciably. These are obviously only my considerations and other people could find in the XR that plus to appreciate it and promote it more than the X. 'iPhone X, also in this circumstance was punctual thanks to the Prime service of Amazon. I hope that this review of mine can be of help to other people interested in the purchase choice.	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	mixdevil	3	no longer perfect	2018-10-25	de	First I would like to say what bothers me and what I've experienced so far (iPhone owners are iPhone 2). The iPhone crashes regularly at regular intervals, often you do not notice it because it looks normal again after booting, you just have to enter the pin because the face ID does not work then. Most often, the error occurs in long-term use, eg via bluetooth in the car listening to music over the car radio. It happens that it crashes every 20 minutes. What then helps is a shutdown and start again, then I'm lucky that it runs over an hour. I have normal day use that happens to me only 2-3 times a day. As I have learned in forums, this is not uncommon. This has never happened to me before. Otherwise, I find the quantum leap from iPhone 8 to iPhone X just succeeded and long overdue, the operation is intuitive and face Id works mostly very well. The price, on the other hand, is an absolute impudence, how many billions will apple still want to gain. 1000 euro for the 256 Gb device would have been absolutely sufficient, especially since the memory costs nothing more. For this reason, I will again downgrade the next model and take the cheaper even if I then have to do without OLED and the second camera	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	dot_ore	3	Do not skin me! 6S v 7	2016-09-18	de	I got the iPhone 7 for the release day and had a couple of days to test it thoroughly. The technical details should now be clear to all. Likewise, the optics, which is almost identical to the 6 Series. Excluding the missing headphone jack -> stereo speakers, the slightly better integrated antenna, two new colors and the revised Hombutton with Taptic Engine. The display was also expanded in the color spectrum but not really noticeable. The contrast is slightly better and the colors are clearer. Unfortunately, the phone takes much longer at startup than my 6S. Both have the current iOS 10 on it! My test is primarily about the camera in the iPhone 7. After many photos shot, I must say that the slightly larger aperture F 1.8, although more light and thanks to the optical image stabilizer, the pictures a bit sharper, yet the differences are tiny. Some shots during the day seem a little bit overexposed. But scores the camera in poor lighting conditions. Here is an improvement to see. However, the shots are sometimes alienated, that is too lightened and thus do not quite correspond to the reality. Likewise, the slightly drilled selfie camera, now in HD with 7 MP, which also has an image stabilizer. The photos are usually less blurred than the 6S, but the quality of the photos is hardly a difference. Since I am privately involved in photography, I had considered moving as a mobile camera on the 7 Series. But after the few days I'm not convinced. The normal 7 Series is not a worthy successor to the 6S for me. At most a 6S + or so. Anyone else who still owns a 6S, let's just wait until the iPhone 8!	0
iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Client d'Amazon	4	at the height, but price too high	2016-09-17	fr	This iPhone 7 brings some innovations compared to the 6s: A space of storage of 32 go of baseAncienement delivered with 16 go, one passes finally to 32 go. However we see that we go directly to 128 GB then 256. Apple is clearly trying to push the consumer to take the most expensive models. A 64 GB entry-level would not have been lux, especially for 769 euros! The camera is also evolving well, but the best is to try it itself to really realize the improvements. home button is no longer mechanical, it's weird at first. The intensity of the haptic feedback is adjustable in the settings and also the first time the iPhone is launched.Certification ip67For this price we could have expected to have ip68 certification as on some Android devices but it is not the case. Too bad ! Anyway it is the first iPhone that enjoys protection against a light swim and dust. If it ever falls into the water, it will take five hours to turn it back on. Stereo speakers. We finally switch to stereo on iPhone, thanks to a built-in speakerphone. The result is nice, without being revolutionary either.Remove the port jack.It is now a reality, no more jack on the iPhone 7. However a lightning adapter to jack is provided in the box. There are also lightning earphones. So be careful if you want to charge your iPhone and listen to wired music at the same time, it will not be possible unless you opt for the Apple doc at 60 euros or use a Bluetooth headset.Ios 10 is very fluid, the passage from one application to another is done without difficulty.Finally, I noticed that the sensor touch id is even faster, the identification of your borrows is instant.Je put a small star in less for the price high, the ip67 certification as well as for the 32 go non-expandable base. So it is a good device overall, even if the price is really too high compared to the competition.	0

Or fast charging, notification LED, larger internal memory and above all a much larger battery? And a lower SAR value would also be great! Apple has very clear advantages, because the hardware and software come from one house and there are regular updates. The security and stability of the programs is top. But the products are so incredibly expensive and it hangs on so basics: - /. As long as especially display resolution, battery and memory do not change, I'll probably stay with Samsung ....	0

iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	1	Very bad purchase	2018-04-15	it	I state that my review is based on the product and not on the seller. I bought this new iPhone, because I wanted something more, something new and different ... instead I found myself holding an iphone 7 plus, a little smaller ... with a camera that was the same but positioned differently and a horrible cleat (notch) in front of the display that basically turns everything you watch on the screen ugly. Non-expandable memory, no fast recharging and even IP68 certification to withstand water and dust, not to mention the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to transfer photos and other media to the PC, everything is slow and cumbersome and iTunes is really a slow and heavy program. Practically an old iPhone for a big change, which has only the price of change, twice the price of a normal iPhone, an absurd price and totally unjustified for what this phone really offers! Equal in all respects to the old models. To say that I am disappointed is an understatement ... I do not recommend the purchase, if you are looking for the wow effect, move on to the competition, which here is only the salty price.	0

The device has a lot of minor scratches, which I did not find so bad, because it is a used device. Unfortunately, this phone had a relatively large Kratzerfas center on the display (in the photo, unfortunately, not so good to see). In addition, it was on the back, faded by using a sleeve with logo cut so much that this was ultimately the reason why I have sent it back (s.Foto). I am a little surprised, because the seller has received good reviews and I therefore ordered. Maybe I was also sent a wrong device. Pity!	0

With the headphones, the phone call is so pleasant that the called often does not even hear that I'm in the car. Thus, for professional frequent travelers - and not suitable Telefon.Update - after one year in use, the battery hardly an hour. No wonder, Apple simply turns off disabled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

As always with Apple (my 3 iPhone) is processed high quality and everything works without problems. All those awarded only one star are poor guys who can afford only a cheap plastic smartphone from the grenade manufacturer Samsung. All Android Smartphone manufacturers have the worst service imaginable. Apple service is top. Had a Samsung S3 before. Was a disaster the phone. Self-ripping displays are not even available at Apple. The Android operating system can not be enough for iOS anyway. Can not understand why some TV manufacturers take such a shitty system as Android even for your TV.

iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	ohlen	1	Big Apple is watching you! Go JOLLA PHONE!	2016-02-22	de	My urgent recommendation (26.03.2016): Switch to the Jolla-Phone. Finnish understatement, a hundred times hipper than Apple's all-round bug. And also without anti-democratic NSA connection (no 5eye, no Patriot Act)! I have now made the detour via Blackberry (using the Canadians '5eye' Android) to JOLLA. Ergonomic, reliable, removable battery, 2-3 days battery life. For 199, - €. in 5 days the JollaPhone is with you. Incl. Right of Withdrawal - Take the opportunity and try it out! And one more thing: anyone who clicks anonymously on the negative side or, in part, pitifully condescending to the new Stasi, has already lost today. Resist, Leite. Freedom is more important than all these apps for teens.Here's the review ... I was a fan and a loyal customer of Apple. Have bought a number of professional Apple computers, iPods, iPhones and tablets from the manufacturer and gladly used. After the group acts as a stooge of various anti-democratic intelligence agencies, all of which violate our liberal fundamental rights, I will the group until further notice, no "" fresh Money "" Apple has become the pioneer of all henchmen of total surveillance. Virtually everything that happens on the internet is collected in Utah (Utah Data Center -> google). Data about unwelcome journalists. Data about our politicians of tomorrow. Data on decision-makers in politics and business, which deviate too much from the course.Democracy is being eroded. People become blackmailable! Apple is the only smartphone maker ALL component hardware firmware software (iOS operating system) - Synchronization software and MediaShop (iTunes) This combination requires a responsible, confidential handling of personal customer data. This responsibility was and is Apple as an NSA cooperation partner does justice. Keywords: - Private data, contacts, information on media user behavior is not protected from access by third parties - Apple's NSA cooperation (US intelligence, which closely monitors the FRG) - GPS -Data / motion profiles land on US servers, to which the US secret service NSA has direct access.- Software with "" backdoors "" provided - hardware remotely controllable (camera, microphone) - fingerprint scanner (this feature would have me in one SouthPark episode on the NSA cooperation requested) - questionable for professional use, eg. B for investigative journalists (informant protection), judges, lawyers, politicians, environmental activists, doctors and young people who want to pursue a comparable career - French and Brazilian parliamentarians are prohibited from using such devices for security reasons - As a luxury device in the professional segment only conditionally suitable - THANK YOU EDWARD SNOWDEN! - THANK YOU GLENN GREENWALD! - THANK YOU "" THE GUARDIAN ""! Further: - Foxconn (maximum return for shareholders) Otherwise, a great device. Private users, who are uncritical of developments in government surveillance and data retention, are likely to enjoy their device. Note ("Apple did not have a choice ..."): "There is a positive example, a company called" "lavabit" ". A provider of encrypted communications. Mr. Snowden has sometimes communicated about this service. The NSA wanted to force the managing director, Mr. Ladar Levison, to publish a general key or access to the server / user data. Mr. Levison preferred to quit his job, his livelihood. I'm sure that if Apple, Microsoft, google, yahoo, facebook, skype had gone public together in due course, an NSA boss would have lost his job and finished. It looks like all of these companies are architects of total surveillance. Maybe to defend democratic values ​​in faith. At least since we know that the "democratization" of countries like Iraq or Ukraine clearly does not aim to improve the lives of the people, it is important to punish the accomplices and their followers.Who is committed to freedom and Sometimes betraying democracy by doing commissioned work for Apple or its clients here should make it ashamed and think about what mess he / she will leave to his / her children. Do not participate. Perform resistance!	0

Well, OKSchlimmer is, however, that the seal was completely missing. Furthermore, various screws were loose in the device, a screw was not tightened and slid inside the case back and forth, which would have led to prolonged use quickly to a board damage.

iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	D. Meier	5	Very satisfied with the iPhone Xr	2018-11-13	de	I buy a new smartphone at least once a year. Last year I had an iPhone X, meanwhile a huawei p20 pro and now an iPhone Xr in blue. I made the purchase via Telekom and am so far very satisfied. It seems to me a very good iPhone to be a fair price compared to the other Xs and Xs Max. The display is, in spite of all bad reviews, completely ok, but in no case bad. Sure, the iPhone X is sharper and more brilliant. But the display of the Xr is good enough. Who says it was bad, it has not had in the hand, no idea or just goes to the data sheet. The camera is great, the general performance without jerking and without long waiting times. The battery is awesome. I use my smartphones very intensively and have between 30 and 50% after one day. For skeptics: I'm a techie and do not get any money for this recession. I wrote it freely.	0

iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	Nam D.	1	Is the iPhone worth the money?	2018-12-14	de	Wondering if it's worth spending so much on an iPhone XS? No!!! I am an Apple user myself and have a MacBookPro and an iPhone. I still tolerated it on the MacBookPro, but not on the iPhone XS at all. It's already as expensive as the MacBook Air, which can do more ... processing or not ... the iPhone is a cell phone and has no 4GB of RAM / RAM. I think nothing of the internal memory, which can be up to 512GB. One does not use the mobile phone for 10 years, in order to use so much. No app eats up so much memory and you could not enjoy it either. I would rather wait until the iPhone is downgraded to a reasonable price that you can afford. If you want to buy a € 1,000 + cell phone, ask yourself what you want to do with it. If you just want an expensive cell phone that looks and is processed well, buy it. If you want to have a status icon that shows you can afford expensive things, the phone would be ideal. If you use a mobile phone to play, talk on the phone, chat and watch movies, you should wait at least 1 year or look for another phone. At a price of 800 € or max 900 €, I could understand it (I would always not yet worth it).	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Mercuryball	1	Save your money.	2019-02-05	us	The most expensive POS to come out of Apple. It’s a $200 phone for $1000 bucks. If took the same money and put it towards a great camera you would have a professional camera and could buy a simple phone. Apple has duped us once again. By far the worst apple purchase I have made. My last time I buy a phone from this overindulgent company that puts more thought into its packaging than its products. Basically the overpriced less impressive model that Starbucks and Apple have milked us for for years. Learning that Apple no longer is innovative...it follows an ever growing pack of cheaper, more stylish competitors.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Niczilla	3	Too expensive	2019-01-26	de	I'm actually an iPhone fanatic. I have been able to try many brands & models so far. The first thing that struck me as negative about the iPhone X: there is no longer the small needle with which you can open the SIM compartment. Yes, says the colleague, I'll do it with the paperclip. Because of: it requires a paper clip with tact, you do not want to scrap such an expensive part, because you fool around it. Well, Apple saves, despite the high price of a cent article. Not good. It is striking: the headphones are in a cardboard part, not as usual in a fixed box. Saved again! I have set up two devices again. One wanted an update before you could set it up, setup only went with Apple ID login, which was not possible because the update was needed. I guess 9 out of 10 buyers in the situation would be desperate. I'm really not used to this from Apple. High price = luxury.What can the X do more than the 6s? It's damn fast.No finger press, Zack, unlocked: iPhone has recognized you.Otherwise ... if you're not a techie: sorry, then it still does 6s , Everything else is cool, my iPhone is cooler than yours. Nevertheless, the iPhones are simply great. Two points deduction for price in combination with the mentioned savings and the complicated initial setup.	0
iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Kundenrezensent	5	Attention: Required SIM card not included	2016-11-14	de	After an unpleasant experience of a car accident resulting in an incomprehensible condemnation to a partial guilt, I informed myself about the possibilities of digital recording to substantiate disputed accident situations. Since I wanted a good image resolution and a certain compactness, I decided against a chunky digital camera and instead for this compact iPhone 7 Plus with additional phone function with suction cup windshield mount, especially since this dual camera had aroused my curiosity. After attaching to the windshield above my Steering wheel were my driving experience by the permanent sideways looking past the device holding the head rather painful nature. If this device turned out to be a little smaller, such compulsions would certainly be avoidable. However, the image quality convinced me a lot that I quickly took the decision to keep my iPhone. Only a so-called SIM card (as I later learned) was still missing to total happiness, as this unfortunately had not included the delivery. So I decided to visit my electronics store in the Neuköllner Karl-Marx-Straße. I bought this SIM card to finally use this phone function. But when I returned to my parking lot, a huge hole in my windshield gaped. The sucker and the phone were gone. Since I realized that I had not only imagined that with the high weight of the 7 Plus. Now I knew what the plus stood for. It was apparently broken by the heavy weight of the disc. I was sad about the now useless SIM. At home I had tears in my eyes. Not because of the loss, but rather because of the wind. I asked the honest finder and rescuer of my iPhone by newspaper advertisement to hand it over at the next opportunity in the lost property office. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting today. Maybe he will read this review.	0

What I really want to criticize is the price is by no means worth justifying the device's regular lags, the camera is no better than the Huawei devices. Quick charger must be purchased seprat. AUX adapter is not included. I will sell this smartphone again and get the Huawei P20 Pro.

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Thomas K.	1	Headache and eye pain due to oil technique and face ID	2018-02-12	de	I had to exchange the Iphone X for an Iphone 8Plus because I got a headache while using the device. When I turned off Face Id it got better, but my eyes continued to seep when reading websites. I entered "eyestrain with Iphone x" at Google and lo and behold: Many users have this problem due to an unobtrusive flickering of the OLED display. In addition, the attention check of the face-id camera ensures that the face is regularly scanned with UV rays. That can not be healthy! Since I own the Iphone 8Plus I have no more problems with it.	0
iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Jet Black	James Mitchell	5	iPhone 7 Plus Review	2016-11-05	uk	Design:The new iPhone is not a massive change from the 6 and 6S. It features the same rounded edges and 4.7” and 5.5” screen sizes as before, and is the 3rd in a line of an iterative design started by the 6. The most notable differences are the new Black and Jet Black finishes and the larger camera bump which is now built into the enclosure. I personally love my Jet Black finish as it looks like a mirrored surface and the front and back meet seamlessly - almost like a slab of aluminium. It also feels great in the hand with a more grippy surface than its matte siblings. I have got micro-abrasions on mine but these are only really able to be seen in bright light and in normal light are not noticeable. I have however kept my phone in a case since I received it and have seen pictures on the internet with very bad scratches on the iPhone. If you take care of it, it’ll be fine.One major difference and the cause of a lot of controversy with the new iPhone has to be the headphone jack - it’s gone. I thought I’d miss this a lot more than I did. The included adapter really helps the transition and just stays plugged into my earphones from now on which doesn’t really affect me. I also own a few bluetooth headphones and these work perfectly with the new iPhone. My only gripe has been when I have wanted to use my phone for Discord or any other App that needs headphones and charge. Usually I don’t need to do this but I prefer to plug in when I am gaming to stop the phone from dropping in battery too fast. My workaround was to use bluetooth headphones for this but the other solution would be to get a splitter, something that isn’t too expensive.The main reason for removing the headphone jack in the iPhone was to increase waterproofing. The new iPhone finally gets my most desired feature. I no longer have to baby my phone in the rain or be wary when changing songs in the shower. From tests seen on the internet, the waterproofing is very good on this phone and usually better than the IP68 rating it has. Apple is usually very conservative with its rating systems and although I wouldn't suggest going swimming with the phone, it’ll easily handle the odd splash or drop in the toilet. Using the phone with wet fingers or with droplets on the screen has also improved and I am very impressed with this. Before, a nearly dry hand was needed to operate the phone due to accidental inputs with the water droplets on the screen. On the new iPhone however, the rejection of these inputs has been sublime. Apple also claims a higher colour gamut screen on the iPhone which I didn't really notice but I really noticed the 25% extra brightness which helps outdoors. I would love to see an OLED display on a phone but until VR comes to the iPhone, I really think that a 1080p panel boasts the best battery life/performance/DPI ratio on a 5.5” phone.The new stereo speakers on the phone are another welcome addition I have wanted for a while. Apple claims a 50% increase in volume and I fully believe them. At max volume there is (almost) no distortion and they sound really loud - so loud I can leave my bluetooth speaker when I go to the shower. For casual listening, they are a god send. The automatic change when rotated is also great and the phone seems to output the same volume in both orientations, something I tested to see if it was the case. One thing to note with the added waterproofing is that when the speakers get wet, their volume reduces drastically and distortion is heard. This is solved when the phone dries after about 5-10 minutes but is just something to bear in mind.Performance and Camera:The performance on the iPhone 7 is just as good as the 6S. Although Apple claims a 40% increase in performance since the 6S, the UI is so smooth that you can’t notice it. It will be great for future proofing however and I welcome the change. Apple has swayed from its usual dual core chip however; the A10 is now quad-core although it doesn't use all four cores at the same time. Two are low powered cores which use 1/5 of the power of the A9 with the same performance whilst the other two are the high performance cores with the 40% increase in compute. This really ingenuous solution along with the slightly larger battery has made sure that the iPhone lasts all but the most demanding days. I regularly ended the day with 20% left which is a lot better than the basically 0% my 6S Plus used to rock up on.Both the front and rear cameras have been upgraded on the new model too. With a larger aperture, both can now take better low light photos. The front camera now takes 7MP photos and its low light performance has gotten really good - almost too good as now all my pores can be seen! The real star of the show is the back camera however. Low light performance is really good, on par with the S7, the current leader in this respect. Optical Image Stabilisation is also standard on all iPhone 7 models now which really helps with reducing the shake on videos and reducing blur in photos, especially in low light. The real step up for the 7 is the extra camera on the back (making 3 total). This camera is dubbed the ‘telephoto’ lens and is a 2x zoom from the normal. This allows great zooming without loss of quality. Another thing it enables is ‘Portrait mode’, a DSLR like option which allows the background to be blurred out. This, although still in beta, seems to be really good and has produced some amazing shots, better than any compact camera I have used and rivalling (not replacing) DSLR quality at first look.Software Experience:The new iPhone 7s all ship with iOS 10, Apple’s latest iteration of its mobile software. It does away with some things, namely ‘Slide to Unlock’, a legacy Apple creation and has now been replaced with ‘Press Home to Unlock’. This new method of unlock is really great for phones with Touch ID (not so great for non-Touch ID but that’s a different story) and along with raise to wake, makes your phone just seem more alive and useful. The widgets when swiping left are really useful for quick glances. I will look up my next lecture or check what reminders I have with a quick swipe and that will be it, a lot more convenient than before.3D touch has been getting better and better and the new lock screen combined with 3D Touch has just become a really great experience. 3D Touching on a Notification will bring up quick actions and even sometimes an actual window with previews of messages. This is an ingenious feature which has really helped with quick replies and is just something that is fun to do. Before, 3D Touch was limited to previewing and shortcuts and now it is so much more. So many apps take advantage of it for extra content, quick settings and its convenience and tight integration is something you don’t find on any other smartphone. I have got used to shortcuts from my 6S and now use a few, not as many as Apple may hope but enough to justify it as a feature.One of my favourite features about the new iPhone 7 has to be the Taptic Engine. It has been improved since the 6S to now vibrate on some other things happening in the system. For example pulling down the notification shade causes a small bump when it hits the bottom, when scrolling through the different minutes in the clock app, it will give a small bump at each one it scrolls past. Although these may seem like small things, this really gives the iPhone a mechanical feel which is really nice. I actively seek out ways to use these things as they just feel so futuristic whilst retro at the same time, a throwback to the mechanical days.This Taptic Engine is also used to power the home button. No longer a physical switch, the home button is now a solid state button that activates when it senses a force on it. At first I was not so sure about the button. It feels different to anything I have used before and sometimes can feel like the whole bottom of the phone is moving. However, I quickly became used to it and now prefer it to anything else. It never fails and feels quite realistic and I welcome a change that will reduce the fragileness of a button whilst also improving its waterproofing capabilities.Durability: Over my month and a bit with the phone, I have (as mentioned) picked up a few micro abrasions on the phone. It goes everywhere with me; the gym, rock climbing, lectures, excursions and so on and looks almost new. I do use a screen protector however and over one of the parts where it is not covered, I have picked up a small scratch. I don’t baby my phone however. As it is all solid state I will chuck the phone on a desk and take it to places other people wouldn’t take it like rock climbing where chalk and the constant fear of people falling on your phone is rife. I really like the waterproofing of the phone as it means I can run it under a tap when done to wash off anything. I have had back protectors (like screen protectors but for the back of the phone) on however to reduce the risk of scratches however my first application didn’t go too well. When removing the film, I did notice that some of the markings were coming off the phone. These have just got fainter and are hard to see in normal light. I actually prefer this however as I never really liked the markings on the back of the phone however might be annoying when trying to read the serial number or any important information.Conclusion:The iPhone 7 is a great phone. After all the negativity of the removal of the headphone jack, it seems that many people actually can go without it, especially with the inclusion of an adapter in the box. The iPhone 7 has quite a few more features that do warrant its 7 name and its camera has been significantly upgraded in the low light department, taking really good pictures in the dark. Before with the 6S, I could see more in the dark than it, but the 7 seems to be able to pick up more than I can. I truly believe that this phone can sit with other flagship phones of 2016.	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Drinking Glue	1	The last dirt	2019-04-09	de	I was always very happy with the previous iPhones, so I put up with the damn high price for the 256 GB model. The iPhone X is just garbage. The touchscreen is not responding properly. At the edge, movements with the finger are not recognized or not recognized correctly. Zooming with the 2-finger gesture works in Safari only randomly, because as soon as you take your fingers off the screen, the zoom effect is back to standard back. Apart from the incredibly poor operation, not even Apple works since the last iOS update Carplay right. There are always disconnections and Apple support does not help you. There are only "" you have already tried another cable or iPhone "" standard answers. If you throw € 1,000 in the garbage bin, that's better than buying this phone.

After my Iphone x fell to the floor and the display jumped, I was in the GRAVIS store. A friendly colleague told me that he has not seen many Iphone X yet and he can not tell me if maybe a sensor or something similar has broken down and recommended that I go elsewhere! I then got the Apple Care Number (0800 ...) called, there they tell me for 4 days now that within a radius of 150 km around my place of residence in the next 8 days no more appointments are free. For more than 8 days, employees can not schedule appointments (in 2018). I was therefore advised to call early each morning and hope that I get an appointment somewhere. The repair of the display costs the way 320.00 €, which should be considered when buying synonymous! I will now sell my broken Iphone X on Ebay and buy a SAMSUNG phone again. Unfortunately my move to Apple was not a good idea.	0
iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Scotty	1	Why Apple?	2018-05-01	uk	The IPhone was doing well up untill the 6S and was beating Samsung but not any more...Apple are verry good business people and could stick there name on anything and people would still buy it like the Air Pods! See just buy removing the headphone Jack they want you to spend more of your money.The question you are wondering ""Is this phone really worth £1000?"" NO IT ISN'T!Here are the reasons why-1) It says it has the best display on a phone yet it isn't as good as Samsung displays from the S7 onwards. Even worse why did they cut some of the screen out for the notch when they should of just placed it above in all black so you atleast get the whole screen when you are watching videos.2/3) Crap Battery life compared to phones half the price of this! Also your gonna constanly need a power bank but that means you can't use headphone when charging so you will have to use bluetooth earphones that won't last as long as normal earphones.4) The dual Camera looks like a rubbish version of Wall-E5) It will slow down next year with an even worse battery meaning you will have to buy another £1000 Phone.If you have sense just don't buy it!	0
iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Oscar	3	A beautiful Peugeot 404 for the toll motorways	2018-04-29	fr	1. CONTEXT I am talking to newcomers in the world of Apple in general and the iPhone in particular: I just bought my first iPhone, the 8 standard, after 3 Android and 3 WindowsPhone, resigning myself to the release of Microsoft from the world of smartphone.2. SERVICE AMAZONAmazon allowed me to acquire this iPhone 8 to 685 euros with a saving greater than 100 euros compared to the market price. Device shipped from Barcelona, ​​in principle destined for the Eastern European market? No negative impact on delivery, equipment and commissioning. This is probably the new trade.3. FIRST IMPRESSIONS A very refined box up to its interior layout, a very nice device, but that I had already approached with a previous smartphone from the Taiwanese HTC. The grip was quite disappointing: I thought I had acquired an Audi Quattro, and I discovered a Peugeot 404 a little restyled, made for the only toll roads of my department. The iPhone was a revolution in 2007; it gives me today a little impression of an old sixty-eight, even if it is well preserved. In detail: 4. THE MATERIALS Beyond the quality of the finish and the aesthetics: - The definition of the screen pixels in width and height) is significantly lower than the current criteria, - The technology of the screen is still LCD while the others manufacturers have switched to AMOLED technology, - The capacity of the battery is 30% lower than the current criteria, - It does not have a fast recharge, - It is not accessible therefore renewable, - The memory of the device is not expandable by a micro SD card, - The cable connection remains clean to Apple, - The main key "" Home "" remains resistive instead of capacitive. It could be advantageously completed to the right and left by 2 other tactile keys. Note the very good operation of the iOS 11 operating system, probably helped by the new and powerful A11 Bionic.5 processor. THE OPERATING SYSTEM (iOS 11) In my opinion, the operating system (iOS, Android, WindowsPhone) is the first feature of a smartphone.5.1 The fans of the iPhoneIl seems that we should not change the habits of the faithful of the first hour who continue to buy the new versions at each of their output, without worrying too much about what the other systems bring over time. One example: iOS does not almost always include the specific context menu that appears with a fingertip held according to the point chosen in the screen.5.2 We are in the closed world of AppleA single example: FaceTime installed to converse with his contacts only allows it with other iPhones owners, unlike his competitor WhatsApp much more generalist.5.3 One is in the hyper-controlled world of AppleOne example: try to recover on your computer media that you have downloaded from your computer to your iPhone or iCloud ... 5.4 We are in a world of moneyI know when it's free, we're the product. But after buying a smartphone to the maximum of the market price for this type of product, everything is oriented, without hiding, to make you spend the most money: music, subscriptions, very limited features so-called free applications etc.EN CONCLUSION "" The iPhone 8 inaugurates a new generation of iPhone. With the iPhone 8, intelligence has never taken such a new form. Not so beautiful. "" That's what Apple marketing says. This can probably convince those who have remained in this world since 2007 and who, let us say, suffer a bit of snobbery to display their iPhone.But currently, the iPhone represents more than 15% of smartphones in use, and it may be time for Apple to better look at what is happening around him if he does not want to suffer the fate of BlackBerry. Between the pump (iOS) and the data pump (Android), difficult to choose . Puzzled ...________________________________________________ POINT IN June 12 2018LES PLUS-quality materials, quality equipment (microphone, speakers, buttons etc.) - The number of available applications-quality applications developed specifically for iOSLES fashioned LESS Conception (one not button at the base, screen technology, screen size etc.) - iOS OS architecture to restructure deeply after 10 years of key enhancements - Safari Internet Browser obsolete - No possibility of memory expansion or battery replacement-More generally, the closed system Apple (how many users do not know how to extract the media files from their device) CONCLUSIONA beautiful little object, exceeded on several levels (it is probably necessary to switch to the iPhone X, but at what price), which continues to feed the cash machine of Apple who lives on its achievements (quality of its applications which the developers are probably well paid, enthusiasm of its fans always on the lookout for the latest model regardless of price) despite the steady decline in its market share.

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	TM	1	Design, Weight, iOS Bugs	2019-05-22	de	The design is beautiful, no question. Unfortunately, it needs to be protected, ideally immediately. Thus, the iPhone X looks with shell, like any other phone. Without a cover, this phone loves to slide down everywhere, because glass is smooth. And glass is heavy too. The iPhone X is very heavy compared to other smartphones. This annoys especially with prolonged use and in your pocket. Furthermore, iOS 12 is full of bugs. FaceID suddenly stops working. Screentime names of the devices do not match. Websites can not be scrolled. Text flickers. The quality of the camera is nothing special. Without additional apps, photos can not even equalize. The operation without Homebutton annoying. Again and again nan unintentionally triggers screenshots. Installation of apps with a double-click is cumbersome. If problems, the Apple support arrogance is hard to beat. In summary, no innovation for the inflated price.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Ryan Knight	3	Lovely looking phone that burns its screen	2018-06-18	uk	Good phone that Apple needed to release! It's the 'newness' that creates the hype for this device but it has one major flaw: it's screen. Yes, the SCREEN can, and will, eventually suffer from 'burn-in,' which is a permanent ghosting effect of picture elements that remain or ""burn"" into the screen thus creating an unsightly look - see pics that I took of the phone from a very popular phone shop...I've seen a good number of these iPhone X's with burni-in.Here are the phone's good & bad points...POSITIVES:+ Good camera = great photos+ Great build quality, with a design & fit for a great feel in the hand+ Good sound from stereo speakers+ Reliable connectivity for WiFi, Bluetooth & mobile data+ The phone is waterproofNEGATIVES:- No Home Button, which takes some getting used to- Gestures can be a bit confusing at first & can be executed by accident- Face ID a bit cumbersome at times & not 100% reliable when wearing sunglasses- (Still) no expandable storage via micro SD card- AMOLED screen suffers from BURN-IN after a while. Sure it looks beautiful but hey check my photosSo, if one likes to keep their screen at full brightness they will eventually see screen elements (icons or text) permanently 'burnt' into the screen. Give it 18 months or more & sure enough, issues will arise.BOTTOM LINE: a great phone ruined by an OLED screen (when it burns in)I WOULD NOT recommend this phone to people who keep their phone/s longer than 24 months.However, I WOULD recommend this phone to people who upgrade their phone every 12 to 18 months, as chances are the screen will still look great 👍	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Néo	2	Iphone? I'm coming back, and that's the big disappointment ...	2018-03-09	fr	My first i-phone, and bin ouch ouch ... the last ... Nice player, I start with its 5 qualities: + fingerprint locking is top: instant, 100% good "" reading "", no more mishandling in the pocket (AP, sms, calls). All my tel will now have this system + the quality of the speakers! A very good surprise! The 7 finally had 2! Essential for the quality of calls in places a little noisy, and for listening to music. And the one from the top is towards the front (logical but not systematic!), But the one from the bottom is towards ... the bottom :( Do not understand that the quality of the sound is so neglected on ... phones! (Their basic function , no?) + waterproof IP67 (but if worry, the SAV refuses to take under warranty if they find water in it! Not honest on their part ... You are warned (e)) + autonomy (holds a day even very loaded) + application permissions: whew, as soon as they are installed, we are asked if we want to share things, and if so, it's often only when the app is used. I hated androïd for that, it seems that there has been evolution since my last androïd (went through the OS BB meanwhile: the top that disappears unfortunately) .Passons the many defects: - Speaking of BB10 precisely (including the intelligent writing system was learning my common words, correcting even a typo), the SMS writing system is really nil at Apple ... Emojis that replace words: gadget. We can not press "" in "" a word to correct it, we must go to one end and then move in the word "" sliding ""! Serious ?? And then propose 3 words only !!! As for the manipulations to just make a point, a figure ... Waw, the zero degree of practice. (and no, I do not want "" sms "") .- The camera (which I use often). Uh, yeah ... "" Live "" useless. Flash and zoom in sales. For 600 € the piece, it deserved better eh ... (only +: low light without Flash). A little worry for me I still have to take a fingertip ... That the one to whom it never happened to me launches the first stone (or a BB KeyOne, I would prefer) - The small switch on the top left sometimes puts himself alone on Silent in my pocket ... Just raging this thing. If still it was configurable ... Lamentable.- taking lightning owner ... Practice because without meaning like usb-c, but this sometimes poses problems (example: when you want to get the battery repaired by someone one that has a micro-usb charger, so common ...). It's like we have to use a different fuel gun at a gas station because we have an iCar ?! I'll have to explain the interest ....... Lamentable.- Itunes ... Who invented this thing ?? Whether for music or photos, it MUST go through this system. No choice since there is no SD player! Lamentable.- absence of led to signal the arrival of a text message, so practical yet ... Lamentable.- no induction charging on this 7.- the iphone have so many delays on androïd ... The 8 to l induction, yeah; it will be necessary to wait until the 14 to have a reader Sd? the 16 for an intelligent sms writing ?? the 24 for a led-sms ??? What joke ! Even their iphone X is missed. Steve Jobs must turn in his grave.Au final: I do not recommend at all this product, nor all iphone for that matter (opinion objective and argued: I am not a hater). Too many non-parametrible stuff, too closed (itunes, no SD player, lightning plug:), non-removable battery, too much stuff on a daily basis ... The only +, other phones on other OS the do too.

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	tactless (no tact)	4	"Amazing, mind-blowing"	2017-07-20	uk	So, I had the red version of this, but I found the white bezels very distracting so I returned it for a refund.Now I've for the black one, I'm amazed every time I use it. The colours are AMAZING. It just like, woah!BUT.. but but … here's the big but.It's slippery and fragile.I use a case (AmazonBasics case), which makes it easier to hold. The downside is that it looks like every other touchscreen smartphone with the case on — but this is also a benefit. I do NOT want to advertise the fact that I'm carrying a high end phone so that some miscreant can throw acid on my face and mug me. [theives can sell it for parts even if it's iCloud locked]. So, I'm happy. [I'm not a show off — I don't care if people think I'm cheap.]All that said, I'm still angry at Apple :- they removed the headphone jack too early. (I'm not rich so no AirPods for me)- they're utterly obssessed with thin-ness. (While it is very, very impressive I shouldn't be scared to break a £680 phone).I use this phone — the iPhone 7 — for videography. The optical image stabilisation is fantastic.My main phone will continue to be my iPhone SE.Just a note: as impressive at the iPhone 7 hardware is, it's really the rock solid software (iOS) and app ecosystem that makes the iPhone so compelling to me. I see competitors — like the Samsung S8 or whatever (”unbox your phone"") — and admit they are jaw-dropping science fiction. But, even so, they don't have the security and stability of iOS.If you can borrow the money, I recommend you buy this from the Apple Store and get a refund on the last day possible. [dont feel bad for Apple — they are loaded]. It will help you appreciate what outstanding engineering this is.It's kind of a misnomer to call this a phone, of course — it is a handheld computer.Be warned : this phone is like crack cocaine. Once you've used this, and you get rid of it, you'll miss it ! It's flawed in many ways, but it's also the very best.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	K.Pol	3	Device defective after 1.5 years	2019-03-06	de	After 1.5 years, the device no longer reacts to touch - even the middle button remains without function. Commissioning is only possible after a reboot - several times a day. After a complaint, the dealer referred me to the warranty of 12 months. A warranty of 24 months has been rejected1. from the dealer - because outside of Germany2. Apple - because on the bill no serial number was specified. Attempts to get a bill with serial number were unsuccessful. My conclusion: in a device for over 700 euros a dubious performance - both in technology and in customer service dealer / manufacturer	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	jamiepryor	4	"the camera on this thing is brilliant, better than other Samsung models that I have ..."	2018-01-23	uk	I’ve had my iphone 7 since early September and here is my review:Positives:- First of all, what sets it apart from other iphones previous to this model is that it is waterproof, meaning that you will no longer be placing your hone in rice when it gets wet, it also means that you get stunning underwater photos- Speaking of stunning photos, the camera on this thing is brilliant, better than other Samsung models that I have used that came out at the same time. This is also great as I no longer have to carry my camera around when I go out on walks and such.- The phones processor is very good and it runs apps smoothly and quickly without much fault, and many of the faults that do occur, are updated in apples software updates- I have the 128gb version of this phone which is a lot more data than I need, meaning that I wont ever run out.Negatives:- One major negative I think that most people have with this phone is that they removed the headphone jack, which means that all headphone plug ins go through the charging port, this means that you can no longer listen to music and charge your phone unless you have a dongle.- Another issue I have with this phone is that it is easily cracked, I recommend that if you buy this product, you also buy a case with it, so you wont end up having to get a new one.	0
iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	Alexander Bakurin	3	iPhone My true opinion	2016-01-10	de	In my opinion, Apple has a monopoly on smartphones. By IOS. I've been out and about with many Android smartphones and even a Windows phone, and I have to say none of them has met the criteria I expect from a smartphone. Reliability and speed. IOS can, however, and that's why I consider the iPhone as my only choice and that's why I have to swallow that bitter price. Monopoly eben.Jedoch this smartphone is anything but perfect. Subjectively, but worth mentioning is the design. Ugly and dysfunctional in my eyes. Good ugliness left out, the functionality of the design is a fact. Or the lack of it better said. The compact size of the iPhone would be a big +. However, good handling is completely prevented by the round design. You think the phone would slip out of your hand, so handy is the design ... The screen has a catastrophic resolution. Not even HD !!! I think that's because otherwise the battery life goes completely down, but it's just frustrating to be sitting next to a guy who has a cheap android smartphone but which resolves with Full HD and then looks at his 800 € cell phone and realizes how much sharper the full HD display of cheap android dissolves. Do not let anyone tell you something! The difference is huge! Those who claim the opposite are either ignorant or still living in the Stone Age and have never seen a FHD smartphone display. Since Apple has to do something.Akkulaufzeit is grottig. In standby, the phone consumes almost nothing which is great, but in use it goes down. Do not listen to anyone who says: "I got 10 hours out of powerusing"! Nonsense that is absolute nonsense! Since I do not want to know what is Powerusing for these people. Orient yourself best s.den Screenontime! That's the best measure of what you can orientate yourself. There were days when I surfed the internet with the phone almost non stop and watched YouTube, and after about 4 hours I wanted to reconnect it. Less than 10% left. Brightness was almost always regulated to 3/4 high. 4 hours is not much... The current top smartphones in the field of battery power create 6 hours in such use. The camera is unfortunately a step backwards compared to its predecessor. Unfortunately, the focus is not very precise. Still small comments: Apple has to downsize the edges of the smartphone. That does not work as it is now. That I had to exchange my iPhone 3 times, of course, is not synonymous. Twice pixel error and once casual homebutton. The camera must never protrude out of the case. The iPhone for doing thicker and extra battery pure. 3D Touch is not working properly yet. The cursor mode is very imprecise and it frustrates me if the cursor then always lands next to where I would like him. A calendar and note widget on the homescreens with which can also be interacted with is necessary. Processing the buttons needs to be improved. Sometimes they become more relaxed after some time and sometimes from the beginning. If they manage to make a button so tight, then all the buttons should be like this, otherwise it's a defect. Also very important: Apple must give people the opportunity to manage the files in the iPhone itself. And via filemanager. In the Android Playstore there is the File Explorer. Something like that would be very welcome on the IOS platform. Also the autocorrection of the spelling needs to be optimized. It is so obtrusive that I unfortunately had to turn it off. It bothers more than it helps. I would like to give the iPhone 6s the best 2 stars, as much price in my view is not justified, and the iPhone technically on the hardware and software side of the time lag behind. However, for me personally, there are some key elements that are fundamental to a smartphone for me, and this in my eyes only the iPhone met (reliability, speed). Because there are no obvious alternatives for me, I have to improve my rating of the iPhone a bit and I therefore give 3 Sterne.Ich I could give anyone with this review my personal experience with this iPhone model closer and contribute to a good purchase decision	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Amazon Customer	1	Robbed me	2019-06-09	de	The phone was nice at first. Didn’t like that it didn’t come with headphones but I knew that was going to be the case. It had some dents in it already when I got it which wasn’t the end of the world. But then after a few months the phone randomly overheated and the camera and flashlight stopped working. I tried to return or exchange it which they were willing to do but now it has been over two months since I sent the phone back and I haven’t received a fixed phone or my money back. Now I’m out a phone and a few hundred Euros! Avoid these guys!	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Weazle	3	Comparison IOS and Android as well as processing / price unacceptable for this performance-- UPDATE 12/2016	2016-12-02	de	The update is at the bottom of the text! This is my second Apple ... but the first Private. Official had and I still have the iPhone 4, and I really only needed to telephone. With the operating system, I never broke apart. I am a diehard Android .. whether HighEnd Smartphone or just "" only "" middle class. This is my first private iPhone ... I took the step dar. Why? Well, out of curiosity, because many have told me how great The new IOS is what you can do with it and how reliable an iPhone ist.Zum mobile phone itself: The workmanship is flawless, no bumps, dents, edges or wobbling Tasten.Der new 3D home button reacts precisely. Likewise, the finger scanner, this responds immediately without error. The touch screen has brilliant colors and reacts extremely precise and without delays. The Fotocam really makes in any mode brilliant pictures, even the videos are very good. All in all, the system reacts pfei Quickly without jerking. Really impressive. Synchronization via PC with or without cable (WLAN) works flawlessly and the software is of course to use. Also SIRI is very helpful. Even if she is sometimes bitchy and does not answer. But if you feel like it, she is very helpful. So I do not type any more appointments but let Siri do that ... as well as we call contacts, etc. You also do not have the iCloud Use calendar or contacts, for up-and-comers like me from Android (Google) that is practical, that you can still save on Google.Denn my Outlook is synonymous with Goggle tuned and so I need to do nothing there. What bothers me, however, very: One I can go to the directories in the directory, just like a hard drive. I can shovel data at will. I can quickly load and set my own ringtones or wallpapers and I have millions of free and helpful apps. WhatsApp can also meet my needs I can not do it that easy any more! And that gives a star deduction. I have to laboriously convert ringtones into the Apple format to get them via iTunes u only charge with WhatsApp as an example - that only takes the on-board sounds. And these are - with good will - completely dreadful and outdated. What does Apple think so .... Even with apps that is such a thing .. .. Many apps cost money that I get as Android free. And many apps are not there for the IOS. Example AVM MyFritz! AppJa which is available for both systems, but for Android already as version 2 with many new features. At Apple not. AVM WLAN does not exist and the program BoxtoGoPRO (for AVM) does not exist. Brother Printer Software is not synonymous like in Android and I could list for hours. That I find weak. It is so tedious, data, etc.To bring the iPhone - Andoid is much better. The price of this iPhone 7 Plus with 128 GB is well beyond good and evil. It is very thoughtful at Apple that you buy more accessories and not - as with Androids - can be used to compatible mass-produced. It is the Micro USB to charge and sync, the jack for headsets ... For Apple well thought-out for profit - for the user, however, completely wrong. All in all, I summarize: very well processed and really very fine tuning of the system - there is nothing to say.But the price is not justified and ease of use in terms of personalization of the iPhone for the user, Apple is miles away from the android. Basically - just because of the outrageous price and the missing Possibility of easy and free personalization through apps - I give really only 3 stars My last Android was a Huawei X5 - even with fingerprint And there was the fingerprint fast as an arrow, by memory card I had to the onboard 16 GB again 128 GB. The body is there also made of metal. The operation of the screen was almost as accurate .... And if I do now comparisons ... 220 euros to 1000 euros ... because I really wonder what that should.Wenn I already buy such an expensive device, I would like to be so limited as a customer nicht.Nun well, I have it now and I'll have to live with that .... but my next one will be an android again - I prefer that .... But that's my personal attitude. UPDATE 12/2016: So, after I got used to this iPhone to some extent, the following is true , which might be important for Android Umsteiger - as I am also - could be About this you can not send music. I've always liked to send birthday songs about it. I can not do that with IOS. Also, I've been able to click several people from my WhatsApp contacts whom I have send something w ollte.Das is synonymous here - but not so einfach.Die frequently contacted contacts can click directly.Gut I think iMessages ... with other iPhone users, you can send great news, emojis and pictures. But just with those. Do not disturb mode: That's sometimes completely wrong. While I still received Android from my selected contacts in the "Do Not Disturb" mode "phone calls, SMS and WhatsApp, this is not here. Really only phone calls This is for me personally completely wrong. The iPhone plays no AVIs! If I get from my surveillance cam an email with an AVI video, I can not play this. That is completely off sowas. I stay with it - the next will be back Android - definite.No conclusion: If my review helped you further then I would be very happy about a positive feedback.If you disagree, please leave a comment, what I could have done better.Thus help not only me, but all interested parties and readers. Many Thanks.	0
iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Tech-Noir	5	Again and again...	2019-02-12	de	Have the X, coincidentally, since it is on the market, so for quite a long time. It's still THE phone for me. Everything works like the first day. Maybe that's why. Initially, in addition to the seven-euro case was still a screen protector on it, but I have removed after a week again. It does not really fit, because of the arched glass. Dust and dirt then collects between the case and screen protector - so no eye-catcher. The sheath protrudes over the edge and that's enough for me. I would like the original from Apple, the leather is already cool, but I do not like the bulge for the speakers. But this is now a minor matter ... The X can be operated super, the home button was never missing, on the contrary, the intuitive wiping I already knew of Nokia's N9 and it was time that other phones have this feature. Face recognition is great , but I would wish that this also works in the car (holder). From thirty centimeters is over. I think that's because the eyes can not be captured properly anymore. (The phone can not unlock even if I'm sleeping). Videos look better than photos. The display is excellent. Even after hours, my eyes are not annoyed. That's probably the OLED. As a Navy (etc.) offers the size of the display in relation to the size of the phone real advantages, even if I think of iPhone 7 (also a super mobile phone) or 8. A battery has my phone too. When it's empty I charge it up. Goes almost everywhere. IOS is pretty good. Unfortunately, Apple does not call me to ask what could be improved. The price was and is insane - but would buy it again anytime. If it's too expensive, buy a Simson. At the moment, however, the phone is almost 300 euros cheaper than the market launch - I think that makes the X a snap. And if I can do without a navy on the way, I still have the SE. That's it. With original Apple case.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Michael Herting	2	Problems with the hardware	2019-05-07	de	Even Apple seems to weaken occasionally. So are currently devices from the production period of the middle of the year 2018 called back by the manufacturer. A defect on the motherboard was found. The result showed u.a. In the form of a "" frozen "" display or the separateness of the Touchscreens.Leider I had to give back in March bought IPhone 8 again. Not all devices were affected. On the homepage of Apple is listed in more detail. At least there can be seen (input the serial number) which device is affected. I can only rate the iPhone 8 with 2 stars, although I have always been satisfied with Apple devices. Shame!	0

iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	M. Sietas	1	Too little for the money!	2015-12-29	de	I do not really know what to think of the positive reviews written here. My family has been using Apple phones for a while, but not me. Nobody could really convince me so far to buy an Apple device. Although there are also regular updates for the devices but these only cause problems. Starting with shortened battery life up to suspended IOS. And I had to judge it again and again as an old Android root user. Have screwed around on these iphones often and I can only say one thing: Save the nice money. Apple should finally start to develop better devices for this price range. Highend devices with Android operating system allow more options, that goes with Apple only with the annoying Jailbreak variant. Apple devices are in my opinion for users who prefer a very simple operation or are simply overwhelmed with Android. Anyway, Apple has not convinced me so far. This has nothing to do with the price, because you get at Samsung and Co simply more.	0

If you want to shoot a longer video with external micro and has to recharge the battery or wants to use a power bank - bad luck! The transfer of mobile phone to PC does not work, you always have to use the iCloud, with many data you have to buy additional storage - a monthly amount I can not erase the backup of my old iPhone from the new iPhone, so it just shut off while filming. In addition, it is quickly hot when filming ... All in all, so just annoying, because you rely on the various software from Apple and this unfortunately only partially work.

A call to the Apple service line confirmed that fact, more than that, the warranty expired more than 2 years ago and the device was designed for the US market, making repairs extremely expensive and complicated. A complete sham package! I can only recommend to anyone here: Stay away from this seller! The phone itself would have been functional, the battery life but still under any criticism. I have an iPhone 7 now and am very satisfied with it.	0

Well, we all have enough free time for it? Take care that the battery NEVER gets really empty. Why? Yes that happened to me twice and 3 of my friends too. If you do not power the smartphone within the next 30min it is DEEP DOWNLOAD, well with everyone it is different, my colleague had it on stream 14h so it showed signs of life again has at the other about 20h and with me even over 35h. now 35h without a cell phone where everything is stored inside and you can reach without replacement cell phone anyone is shit! FOR A SMARTPHONE THAT HIGH CALIBERS SHOULD HAVE MAXIMUM 1-2 HOURS OF DURATION AND NOT DAMAGED 2 DAYS. The same happened to me Iphone 6 and I have directly bought an IPHONE 7 and lo and behold, the same problem. As if that were not enough, they arrive with their stupid safety. One can use his Apple ID nirgens because the whole time want to somehow code what was sent on the defect device. You will not get an appointment online without a ID in this store. My tip: do you buy this, never let the battery go empty, and buy iphone 6, because there is not a big unteschied. I used both and wasted money unnecessarily.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	TeaLow	1	No more Apple innovation and way too expensive!	2018-10-03	de	I have now switched back to Android with a larger display. The only two positive things I liked about the iPhone X were the look and feel and the ability to sync with my other Apple devices like Mac and iPad. Otherwise, the device is just snot. Battery life is not intoxicating, I do not like the operation synonymous, the camera is not better than other, much cheaper devices. In some situations, it is even worse. I find it absolutely ridiculous, why Apple does not finally extend the camera mode times ... professional mode, new filters, etc. All wrong. At IOS, I miss so many opportunities and simplifications that I have with Android, such as Always on display, splitsreen, mirror-share or mirror-screen, fast closing of all apps, etc. For Android, my device connects to e.g. directly after switching on e.g. with my Bluetooth speaker, the iPhone can not do that and I always have to connect the device manually. What bothers me so animal is that always Bluetooth automatically turns on ... what is this shit? I would like to determine if and when I turn on Bluetooth. Did I already mention the missing fast-loading part ?! Since Steve Jobs is no longer with us, it's not really progressing any more and the new iPhones confirm that absolutely. Since one wants to let now the last loyal Apple customers bleed properly, with up to 1600 € for the new devices. Absolutely ill. I do not need to write about the endless problems with IOS and Apple hardware, you can read about it almost every week on the net. So I can only advise anyone from Apple, who would like to do something more than phone calls ... oh yes, there was not something with the reception problem ;-) And if there is now the argument ... at Apple, you get yes for years updates ... may be, but with the blatant weaknesses, I prefer to buy every 2-3 years a new Android Phone for half or a third of the price and then always have the latest software and the latest technology.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Karl	1	The missing headphone jack is a K.O criterion	2017-08-09	de	I have been a big fan of Apple's iPhones since iPhone 4. My last iPhone was an iPhone 6, which I gave away about a month ago, because I received the new iPhone 7 in 256 GB with a new mobile phone contract. For all iPhone 6 converters: the switch is not really worthwhile. The camera is marginally better, the processor is probably faster, but in practice you notice nothing of it. The only other change: the missing headphone jack. This is not an improvement, but a total failure! I think about it every day about the iPhone 7 exchange. The battery lasts a day very difficult. Most of the time I have to recharge during the day. However, this leads to the fact that I always have to take a break when using, so that I can recharge. I talk a lot, listen to music or watch videos from time to time. Then I have to stop in the middle of everything and start charging the phone, because the iPhone does not last the day (with normal use). Really great is the case of calls, where I must either put on speaker or the phone must always hold my ear, because I can not use a headset when charging .. Of course, you could buy an adapter, but is that really useful ?. The provider makes the phones expensive and leaves a connection away. To make up for this, you have to buy an adapter for a lot of money and carry it along permanently, as long as the Driite provider adapter works reliably, because Apple is very rigorous. It hardly has to upgrade iPhone 6 / 6s, but it has a huge disadvantage in everyday life so noticeable that you get the push, you would buy a cell phone for 30 ¬, in fact it is just under 1000 €. Apparently, Apple does not think about that ... I am definitely disappointed for the first time in a long time.	0

Instead we had a simple charger to connect to USB .... that will probably not work long In general when we see a phone is the box there frankly I do not understand too much.I asked the seller he replied that he did not speak very good French and that considering the price of the phone it was normal that they do not provide the box and charger. It's not really the problem it's just that if c is not written we do not know and it is disappointing if one day we come to resell it will be complicated without the box	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Schuli	4	Only meant for big hands	2017-09-21	de	After I got the successor model every two years since the 1st Iphone, meanwhile I have reached the iPhone 7 too. Size pretty much identical to the Iphone 6+, operation has not changed much, except the double touch (press harder on the screen for subordinate functions) Battery runtime has not improved much, and the battery can be synonymous as with all previous models nach.Was annoying, is the camera, which unfortunately protrudes on the back. This can put the phone on the bedside table unsightly. Also, what the hell did Apple think about leaving the Aux socket away? Design-technical reasons may not have had it. Viell. Think back to the iPhone 8 again. By and large, the performance, speed and system stability has been improved. Who is on Apple, eh not around it anyway :-)	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Alejandro	4	Is it worth buying it?	2018-10-20	it	* UPDATED * I purchased this new iPhone on the Apple Store online, just to try it out a little, having already an iPhone X; personally, I don't think it's worth buying, if you already have an iPhone X. This is the much-anticipated version "" S "" of the iPhone X. Let's try to understand what changes compared to the previous version and whether it's worth buying or not . Let's start by saying that there are NO big changes compared to the previous device. No news is resounding this year. The S version, as is well known, only goes to improve some aspects. Moreover, unusually, the most expensive and large "" Xs Max "" version has nothing different than the iPhone Xs, except for its size. We do not find more powerful processors or improved cameras. It's just a bigger iPhone Xs with more battery (and power consumption). I will continue to update this review as I use it. DESIGN: The iPhone Xs does not bring significant changes in design, except in the lower part where the symmetry of the holes, having added an additional antenna, to allow an enhanced reception, also given the novelty of the Dual Sim, which will be discussed later. The rear camera has been moved slightly a few millimeters higher, so the covers of the iPhone X will NOT be fully compatible with the new device. This year we also have the Gold variant. The design remains essentially unchanged, this device achieves an IP68 waterproof rating (6 indicates the maximum degree of dust resistance and 8 indicates a degree of impermeability and resistance , in case of contact with liquids, but especially with fresh water, for 30 minutes and a maximum of 2 meters deep). The guarantee of NO manufacturer, recognizes the damage caused by liquids, so it is better to refer to these specifications, considering ONLY soft water, being the liquid that causes less damage. The resistance to water and dust decreases with 'usury.PROCESSOR: The new iPhone Xs features the brand new Bionic A12 processor (retains the same marketing name as the previous A11 Bionic), but is the first smartphone processor to be built at 7 nanometers. It is equipped with 4GB of RAM, compared to the 3GB of the iPhone X, it is always equipped with 6 cores (2 high-performance and 4 high-efficiency), it has a second-generation neural engine (8-core) capable of performing 5000 billions of transactions in a second (against the 600 billion of the A11). The GPU is designed by Apple and has 4 cores against the 3 of the X. The 2 high-efficiency cores are dedicated to everyday operations, such as social media, apps, games. The 4 high-efficiency devices, on the other hand, are designed to save battery power when performing simpler operations such as chats and messages. However, when all the processor power is needed, iOS dynamically calibrates all six cores to deliver incredible performance (same as iPhone X). Thus, while performing heavy apps, such as augmented reality games or video editing, performance will be greatly improved. I do not find significant changes during everyday use compared to X. Probably, it also depends on the new operating system (iOS 12) not yet fully optimized on this new device. Both are very fast in all operations: multitasking, photos and videos, opening the app and, of course, in games .. BATTERY: Rightly, one wonders given the performance, the battery capacity. iPhone Xs is equipped with a 2658mAh battery (against the 2716mAh of iPhone X); iPhone Xs Max, on the other hand, has the largest battery an iPhone has ever had, that is 3174mAh (against the 2691mAh of the iPhone 8 Plus). iPhone Xs has less battery than iPhone X? Yes. Does it last less? At the moment, I have to say that the duration is a little lower than X, but I also think this depends on the software. FACE ID AND CAMERA: As I wrote above, the cameras are the same as the iPhone X, always with wide angle and telephoto lens with aperture focal length of ƒ / 1.8 and ƒ / 2 respectively.4. Despite this, Apple has added some features on the new Xs / Xs Max, in my opinion, for pure marketing. In fact, both these models (but also the new Xr, with single camera, released at the end of October) are able to adjust the depth of field of a photo both before shooting and in post-production and have an advanced bokeh effect . These effects are also possible on the iPhone X via the Focos app, since the cameras are identical. Change the quality of the photos in low light for the better, since the sensor of the camera has larger pixels and, we also have the smartHDR that goes to perform more shots of the same subject, combining the best parts of each shot as a result (light, movement reduction, colors); according to Apple, this, the depth of field and the boken effect are possible thanks to the new processor able to perform more operations. Nothing that the processor of the iPhone X is not able to do, but anyway .. Even the sensors of the Face ID are identical to those of the previous model, but Apple reports an improvement in the algorithm of the Secure Enclave (separate processor to encrypt biometric passwords) which guarantees a faster unlocking, despite not being a second generation Face ID. Honestly, the speed seems to me to be the same as the iPhone X, which thanks to iOS 12 is even faster and more precise in unlocking. I am absolutely satisfied in this sense.DUAL SIM: We pay attention to this very important detail. The 3 new iPhones will NOT have Dual Sim functionality in Italy. This is because it is not possible to insert 2 physical Nano Sims, since the trolley can contain only one physics, unlike the version intended for the Chinese market that will have two. How does this system work? A sim will be physical, the second sim, instead, will be based on the "" Dual Sim Dual Standby "" technology that allows you to simulate the second sim in a virtual way. This is the future, as this system will make it very easy to change the telephone or operator offer. Unfortunately, at the moment, no operator in Italy allows this function. Probably Vodafone will be the first to catch up with this technology, but not for now (the function has however been enabled by Apple with the version of iOS 12.1). Certainly it will take a few years, as has already happened with the LTE feature of the Apple Watch Series 3, arrived in Italy after about a year (Apple Watch Series 4) and supported solely by Vodafone. We will see future developments. CURRENTLY CORRECTED DEFECTS: If you have heard of the ChargeGate, know that it has been resolved with iOS 12.0.1 (it did not allow recharging, if the screen was off). According to some users, there is still a Beauty Gate that applies a sort of "" beauty filter "" automatically to selfies; in this way, the details of the face will be minimally captured, making the face look like that of a barbie. It seems to have been a bug that has just been solved with iOS 12.1. Some users also complain about an Antenna Gate, especially on the Xs Max, with poor reception in 4G / LTE and in WiFi. The WiFi part was resolved with 12.0.1, while the part concerning the antenna was solved with iOS 12.1. Obviously, in the event that this last problem occurs, Apple will replace the device, free of charge. I hope I helped you with the decision or clarified your ideas. If you have any other questions, please write me in the comments! :)	0
iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Yang	1	PHONE UNLOCK FRONT	2018-11-04	fr	We do not know if it's a new phone because the Apple warranty ends on January 26, 2019 so the phone has been activated before, normally the warranty lasts 2 years.

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	A. Sanli	2	Absolutely disappointed	2018-01-13	de	I am really disappointed with my order. It has nothing directly to do with the iPhone itself, but with the experience around the order. First of all, the delivery took a full 5 days, although the delivery was made by Amazon itself and usually never takes longer than 2 days. But you can actually ignore that, can happen. Finally, the iPhone arrived and what I was absolutely surprised was that the contents of the package was not protected at all, either with bubble wrap or other "" shock-absorbing "" packaging materials. In view of the price of more than 1000 € it would be more than adequate to secure the goods properly. Especially in view of the fact that the package was even slightly damaged in one place. In my opinion, really not at all. Now we come to the phone itself ... I unpacked it, but let it out for safety because of the cold temperatures outside for 30 minutes lying around, so it warms up to room temperature and the battery is not is charged so heavily. When I wanted to turn the device on, it crashed after about a second. At first I assumed that the battery may be deep discharged. After an hour on the charger still nothing happened. I did a reboot and the iPhone actually went off. After about 30 seconds, however, it crashed again. I suspected a software bug and did a recovery on iTunes. After that, the iPhone finally went and I was able to set it up. After about 5 minutes, the iPhone crashed again and despite all efforts, I could not bring it back to work. All in all, I'm just disappointed. For a purchase price of over € 1000 you can probably ask for a working copy. Above all, I have now waited one week for free. Will not order it again because of this experience. Thanks for nothing. Still a few short notes on the phone itself (if that is possible with a broken device at all). The iPhone X has definitely felt super high quality. The size was great and it was just very good in the hand. As far as the "" exterior "" I was really excited. I also really liked the screen. Personally, for example, Notch did not bother me. The only thing that I found strange is the missing homebutton. You may get used to it, but I personally would not have gotten used to it. Otherwise, the iPhone X has actually not distinguished from its predecessors in the 5 minutes in which I could use it. Therefore, I also come to the conclusion that it is really not worth it, in my view, 300 € more to pay for the iPhone X. In the first few minutes you hold it in your hands you are totally thrilled, but then the euphoria flies relatively quickly and you doubt if it was really a wise decision. You drive with an iPhone 8 (plus) definitely just as good, but significantly cheaper Well, ultimately, everyone must decide for themselves. I was not convinced.	0

iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Gray	May Jay	1	Speaker is very bad and after 6 months the battery is dead	2018-08-09	de	I needed an iPhone for work. Almost 240 € for an alleged exhibit I find really expensive, but I thought, then at least I get a well-functioning model. Unfortunately, one hardly hears me, when talking on the phone. It only works via loudspeaker or headset. This is really poor, since it is after all a telephone. The camera is really great and fun to shoot and take pictures with. Except for the bad speaker, I'm so satisfied. Even though I do not think the device was an exhibit. It looks more like used and badly repaired. If I had a replacement, I would have sent it back immediately. Next time I use another provider.6 months after the purchase, I can not use the device because the battery is no longer charged. Within 4 weeks, the performance decreased rapidly and in the end, I was not even allowed to remove it from the charging station because otherwise it would have gone out immediately. Now it is not even more. What else should I say? I wish I had invested the money elsewhere. That was a sad and expensive experience.	0

iPhone 6S	32GB	Rose Gold	PTZ	4	"Good phone, still good despite being released 18 months back.."	2017-05-07	uk	Screen -This 750 x 1334 screen is very good. I have been a long-time fan of vivid displays by Samsung, and this display is just about vibrant. The highest brightness level is very good.The fairly adequate resolution helps to give a clear screen.But to be honest, this screen is good enough at this size (4.7 inches diagonally).Build Quality-Very good. In par with The Samsung S8 and Google Pixel phone. Non removable back. No big improvement in design since the IPhone 6 though. The force touch is new for the 6s series, but not very useful (atleast yet) in my opinion.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, specially for a phone. Not as powerful as the dual speakers of say the Axon 7.But then its in par with the Samsung S7 series. No headphone jack, hence they have provided an adaptor for that, to plug in your old earphones. The other alternative would be to use a wireless headphone.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag. Have not had any issues so far with sluggishness or re-starts etc. However, some android phones get marginally slower after about 6 months of use. You would note that IPhone has considerably lower RAM than the counterpart Android phones.But I have not seen this impacting, on performance.Added features-Micro SD slot is not available to expand memory. But inbuilt 32GB storage is more than adequate for photos etc, but probably not any high quality movies etc.This phone is not water resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP single lens back camera. Note that this camera has no dual lens like the ""plus"" model.Very good photos in good daylight. Acceptable low light photos, but not as good as the Samsung Galaxy S7 series. The front camera is good, but could have been better.Good for a quick selfie but nothing fantastic.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good. However, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon.Battery-Very good 1715 mAH battery. There is no quick charge function. But you may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one day of use on this, if you are a casual user. If you are a power user, still you may struggle to survive a day.Price-The recommended retail price for this is £499, which is quite steep. Bare in mind that the after sales support is quite robust for a year though. When buying through third parties look at the following-Are they locked/unlocked.Has it got 1 year Apple warranty (if its a used product it may not have full year left)Do you get all original accessories with boxFinal words on colour- This is a favourite for sometime now. But may look a bit discoloured after sometime (on the front).This is not a problem with Apple, and generally is an issue with all white coloured phones.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Never	2	Processing should be at 900 euros at 100%	2019-01-11	de	Good day, for just under 900 euros, I expect that the device is working properly and processed. After use, I have found that the Mute button on the side of the device has more play, until, for example. from silent to loud, as with the iPhones of my colleagues. Say it wobbles easily if you run a finger over it. After a conversation with an Apple employee, it turned out that this button should normally be rock solid and should not have a game. He also said that as long as it does not restrict functionality, that's not bad, yet a minimal assembly error. It may sound fussy, but with the price I expect 100% quality on a new device.	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	Federico	1	He stopped going after less than a month.	2018-11-05	it	Received as a gift 20 days ago. 10 years I have Apple phones. Extraordinary (even if it's not worth € 1200) until, from nothing, I touch it on the bedside table and feel it boiling. It is off and does not turn on. The phone was not charging and I had used the hotspot up to 10 minutes earlier. I try to cool it, even with water (I know it's waterproof), but it continues to heat up. Nothing, it has never turned on again. Official Apple "impeccable" assistance: they will receive me BETWEEN ONE WEEK. I am disappointed for the umpteenth time by a company that, since Steve is gone, guesses one every five.	0

One is good and the second has clear reddish up and to the right. This is very bad for so much money. Exchange is not my thing. Right side has a gap between the display and the case, which you can not only see, but the edge is therefore also sharp. The device is fast, fluid and good, but so poor final inspection for so much money ... No, I'm not satisfied! Only one star because of much too high price and bad final control. Today I have noticed that the power button can only print above and below it totally jammed. One device and three quirks.	0

Of course, one can argue about whether a 4K camera in a mobile phone is necessary.Auch nothing can stutter, that the price of 1319 € is a new record and not from bad parents! So the full score concerns the iPhone XAber quite honestly what has ridden here this third party suppliers or what have you smoked 200-700 ¬ charge more than the manufacturer Apple itself? - by the way I can write this review with a clear conscience, since I am the day of Idea was there and it could test! @ Duke if you are not clear with his financial or not in the pay grade with you should just keep your hands off it.

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Pocketketchup	5	Fast faster the fastest	2017-03-09	de	Preliminary, I have not bought the product on Amazon.de.This is not a review that enumerates all the technical advantages, but my subjective opinion.I previously had only Samsung phones of the Galaxy series (S2, S4, S5, S6 and S7) and bin switched to the iPhone, because I have some Apple products in addition to the iPhone as the Apple TV, Ipod and especially a MacBook Pro. For these products, I've been very pleased with Apple's quality and support. In addition I had many problems with the Samsung mobile phones. 4 of the phones had Qualitative flaws that I could not live with. Therefore, I wanted to try the iphone. It should be said that I have the US version and it came to me Refurbishes. The phone is not an Android phone and I thought that myself the annoying setting for personal settings would be annoying, but I have to say that iphone is like my mac. It does exactly what it should and what I want to do is have it. At least once a week, I run to my friend and tell him what I've found for a new feature. This bothers me the often mentioned not existing back button. Since where you need the function there are back arrows and otherwise I'm faster on the home button anyway. I have synchronized my devices with each other, which was the most important decision criterion for me. Here, Apple can clearly points. Whether it is iMessage or Facetime everything is on both devices and the annoying back and forth copy is verschuwndenMein device was unfortunately already broken when I received it. Unfortunately, the microphone was broken, but Apple has its bomb service, it's almost up to Amazon I think, and I had very quickly now a brand new IPhone.Also the subjective opinion of an Apple disciple may not count for many, but I'm convinced of Apple and how many are: Once Apple, always Apple even if a piece is missing in the apple.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	ani	1	Part u. Serial number does not even know Apple.	2018-07-23	de	What can I say that is positive, it actually came an iPhone 8 as ordered. BUT: not intended for the German market as so often (in product description and in response to customer questions) promised by the seller. To camouflage that was "sent "Placed a sticker, I called as a precaution Apple and not even knew the codes on the back. Was then too delicate and I got the phone (still original packaging, therefore no idea if it works or not) sent back. Borderline in my opinion to fraud, especially because here the identity is deliberately veiled and advertised with "mobile phones for the German market." Funny Funfact: I have waited comparatively long for the refund and therefore called Amazon. If you return a higher-quality article - even though it has arrived completely - you have to sign an affidavit first. For every nonsense you get an e-mail. I would be informed about this on demand. Which, of course, the seller now can not do anything, this point affects only Amazon itself.	0

After I was initially excited, I'm just just fed up. It starts with the fact that I pay 850 € for nothing new. And it goes on to say that the XR is a telephone booth. And why in the new version of iTunes you can no longer manually load songs from the PC to the iPhone without splitting the albums into individual songs? It's just backward and weak.

Since I work as a car mechatronic Touch ID often times did not work, because I had very dry hands or had a scar from time to time or scratched Finger.Haptik, look and quality is of course Apple typical non plus ultra in my eyes. The new Camera and the OLED display are just terrific! The price is of course very high, but everyone has to know whether it is a value or not. Since I need my smartphone very often due to a quick change in my job and also need it more often, I was well worth the price.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Miriam Gratelvus	3	Great product, but ghost seller.	2018-10-02	it	On the iPhone I have nothing to say, but unfortunately I told the seller that at the time of delivery I wanted the receipt for any problem and in any case a guarantee. The seller didn't send me anything, but after my reports he sent me a photo of a receipt with that price of course null. So on the product they send 5 stars because Apple has always been Excellence For me, while the ghost seller gives me practically a star. In fact I don't know how to balance the review. This time Amazon downloads the barrel to the seller who, as I have already said, is absent. So if you want to buy, take into account that despite the fact that by law there are two years of warranty, this product is only one year with Apple because the second year given by the seller does not exist. Fortunately I still had no problems.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	FcBayernGrafBecker	1	Ugly, cheap and itunes heavy	2015-10-18	de	Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!	0

Is just Apple and my preference. I have had a lot of Android related issues, I just do not like it. This device is for people who are traveling irrationally. Maybe the competition is doing just as well. But iOS does not even run on the Galaxy S 10. That's why I do not even look at it.	0

After the endless rave reviews on the part of the Apple users, how unbelievably great the system would be, I have to say that I was disillusioned rather quickly. Many features that have long been standard on Android, Apple has not yet discovered for themselves (file manager, send files via Bluetooth, set your own ringtones, phone book contacts mark etc. pp ...) Also the performance in comparison to my 269 € OnePlus X or the previous Nexus 4 is not a revelation. Yes, it runs fast, but not faster. And yes, there were occasionally stuttering on Android, which, however, is just as much and more pronounced in the case of the iPhone 7. I also had Already 2 complete crashes. Then nothing went for about 10 minutes until the device rebooted by itself. I have only installed a few standard apps (Whatsapp, Facebook, Runtastic u nd a few others) so no "" special stuff "" that would be known for problems. Android is clearly the system that offers much more extensive operation options. It goes in many places just deeper into the matter and is no less fluent. Apple users who claim that iOS 1000x would be better, unfortunately I can not take from now on for full. The probably had so far nothing else than Apple in hand. Unfortunately a very expensive realization. Nevertheless, the iPhone is a good Smartphone.- It has a great display! Color reproduction and illumination are excellent, although the resolution could be a bit higher. You can see the difference to a Full HD display but quite clear, if you had something before.- The sound of speakers and (reasonable) headphones is the best that I could hear so far on a smartphone! - The camera is a total top! Images are always sharp and do not blur. The videos are free of vibration and very smooth. The sound is very good over. The colors could be crisper. They sometimes look a bit pale. This has nothing to do with reality. The memory is generous with 128 GB and one has not the trouble with the dizzy storage management on Android (app on SD, app intern, app on both, SD configured as internal storage...) - The quality of the phone I find less good. I often have a lot of background noise and when talking on the Bluetooth handsfree in the car, while driving, the connection is extremely bad. No matter where I am. This was better before! - The battery will last for about 2 days under normal conditions. I think that's great! - The loading takes a long time. From 0-100 short 3 hours.- Sometimes annoys the already mentioned jerking and "hang on" "already extreme. Especially because you would not have expected that from an Apple device at the price. To 99% it runs fast and completely liquid.- The Homebutton with Taptic Engine is for my feeling GENIAL! I got used to it right away and would not want to miss that anymore. The fingerprint recognition works lightning fast.- The missing jack connection does not bother me. That it had to be a "Lightning" and no USB port, is annoying. Of course, I knew that before ... a few cables worried and good.- The synchronization of images, music and files between PC and iPhone is awkward! That could have done much better and must (see Android!). You can not send a few pictures to the notebook via Bluetooth! Such a nonsense! - Biggest plus in comparison to Android is of course the supply of updates. Apple does it the way I would for all other manufacturers. Since 5 years old devices are still supported. All in all, the iPhone makes what I want, if sometimes over the detour. I will certainly use it for the next 3 years, but then switch back to the Android world. That's just me as technikaffinen user mehr.Schlecht the iPhone and iOS is certainly not. Just different.	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Kman	2	Produktionsengpässe? Fail.	2017-11-04	de	The alleged production bottlenecks are rich marketing tricks to make this overpriced price seem normal. Only the 1st batch may be a bit tight. If you could not pre-order one at 3.11 on the 27.10, you'll get one. 21.11 delivered. If you order now after 1 week or after the release only at Apple, it also gets from 21.11.It is the first time that the user experience has deteriorated significantly in an iPhone, because the removal of Home Button brings significantly more disadvantages with the omission of the jack connector. The 5.8 "" display on the paper is even larger than 8plus with 5.5 "". In practice, most apps / videos are not adapted to this stretched ratio. Anyone who has become accustomed to Plus devices, the X-display would be much too small, because areas at upper and lower edges can be hardly used effectively. In the area 5G (if 5g as planned from the end of 2018 standard) X is far behind Note 8 and Huawei mate 10, future-proof in 1 or 2 years, the device is not. With such a 1149-1319 euro device it is already a bit poor. Clearly many problems can be eliminated in the future via software update, if the app developers are already, extra time for a single device variant to invest, nevertheless X is in actual form really no mature product. In China, reseller prices are already just below OVP. It will not be long before the customers come to their senses again and realize how overpriced this Protype is and can not even sell for 500 euros in half a year.	0
iPhone XR	64GB	Black	🇮🇹 Schälflj 🇮🇹	4	A balanced terminal, but why did it NOT fully convince me? Iphone XR or X?	2019-01-21	it	Given that in the family we have other iPhones, a 6S and an X, we have decided to also buy the latest XR, taking advantage of the fact that Amazon also sells Apple products directly. Purchased in BLACK color, sold and shipped from Amazon at 759.05 euro in December 2018. Leaving aside the technical features of this XR now available everywhere, let's move on to my feelings of use at a distance of a month. the iPhone arrives in the usual classic Apple box, but this time, unlike the X model, we find only the HEADPHONES with LIGHTNING plug and unfortunately no ADAPTER (cost 10 euro on the market, so why not enter it). THE CHARGING FEEDER is always the same, if we want one fast or we already have it or buy it separately. CONFIGURATION of the phone is very fast, especially if you already have another iPhone and we are in the hands of the new terminal ready for use in a few minutes. The SCREEN is criticized by m also because it would only be an LCD, frankly it does NOT make me scream in scandal, nor do the thicker FRAMES, almost inevitable given the type of screen. If you then choose the dark color, you may not even notice all these thick frames. Sincerely, compared to the iPhone X this LCD of the XR is not at all out of place, certainly it will have something less, but at times I appreciate it even more of the OLED, above all on the shade of the WHITE, perhaps less on the NERI. Even in the open air, under the light of the SUN I have not found particular problems of visibility for this screen. The FACE ID is excellent, it does not lose a stroke in every condition of light and I would say from almost every position, except for some sporadic cases; it is enough just to install it to register your face TWO times as the phone asks. The AUDIO of this XR, for phone calls as for listening to videos, I find it good, as well as the reception of the telephone signal and 4G; no problem even for WiFi reception and fast switching between WiFi and 4G, at least under the Vodafone network. FLUIDITY of use of the phone is good, thanks to the new processor, I have not found slowdowns or significant blocks. it has improved compared to other iPhones, something more than the X, simply perhaps because the battery is bigger / more powerful and the LCD screen asks for less energy than the OLED. In this, Apple technicians were really good. With average use, you can easily get to the night with a good 30% of the remaining charge. So everything is fine here, so why didn't the phone completely convince me? I personally try to keep the phones I use in exemplary conditions and as far as possible I try to avoid damage of any kind, so purchase cases and protective glasses. Once the package is opened, the first sensation I had was a beautiful terminal, although in the BLACK color you cannot appreciate the beautiful shades produced by Apple. But as soon as I picked up the phone to start its configuration, I realized that, even without a protective case, the DIMENSIONS were at the limit of comfortable one-handed use, both for size but also for WEIGHT, with the risk that, having the glass back, could get out of hand.And I can guarantee that these feelings can only be properly understood by using the telephone and not by trying it a few moments in a store. But even in this, many may get used to it; after all the needs and feelings of everyone are different. The thicker and BOMBATI FRAMES significantly increase the width of the phone and having in any case a glazed back if we still want a better GRIP, a better outlet for everyday use, we will have to add a HOUSING. At this point I tried to buy two cases of different thicknesses, one of which is SLIM, but not extra slim, because if a phone like this gets out of hand and the case is not sufficiently protective, the glasses make a bad end. About the WEIGHT, about twenty grams more than the X, with the addition of a lightweight case, we arrive safely at 219 grams and if in the flying use we might not realize that much, if we want to manage the terminal with one hand, then maybe supporting it with the little finger from below, or we have a long phone call I can guarantee that the 219 GRAMS added to the WIDTH of the phone begin to be heard. In all this, the HANDLING OF USE loses a lot towards the iPhone X. Someone may object that it is enough not to add a case and the phone is lighter, of course, but at the risk of destroying a terminal that is not exactly cheap if unfortunately there gets out of hand.For a judgment on the CAMERA, I state that I am passionate about photography, but normally I use my Nikon reflexes and change the lenses as needed. Overall, the cameras, both front and rear, are excellent lenses, as much as less during the day or at dusk and I noticed a greater BRIGHTNESS and better DETAIL than the iPhone X, especially in conditions where the light is poorer. All thanks to the new HDR SMART which combined with the new processor guarantees good clicks. But if you go to zoom the sharpness could drop since there is not a 2X optical zoom as on the iPhone X. But what did not convince me on the rear camera are all the reflexes, of which most annoying and not eliminable, which you have if photos are taken in the presence of ARTIFICIAL LIGHT; not only powerful lamps or lamps, but also small LED lights. Some annoying LENS FLARES that in some cases cannot be avoided even by moving of position and that leave clearly visible on the image of the reflected bright points. I honestly don't know if it's the copy I received or if it's the XR standard. So better iPhone X or iPhone XR? The correct answer could be iPhone XS, but the cost rises a lot. Having tried both the X and XR models, personally, evaluating the pros and cons of both terminals, at the moment I would still vote for the iPhone X. But if you have no problem managing a properly NOT small end, undoubtedly the iPhone XR is a balanced phone with good overall performance; if then there was a revision of the downward prices, even better. As for delivery, even in this circumstance it was as always fast and punctual on Amazon's part, thanks to the Prime service. I hope this review will be of help in choice for other interested people.	0
iPhone XR	128GB	White	Donato t.	1	Disappointment, defective product	2019-06-07	it	Product arrived Thursday 6 June. Just turned on, after 1 second it turns off and it doesn't turn on anymore, through assistance service first Amazon and then Apple I bring the phone in assistance, it results defective. Activation date of the phone is January 13 instead of June 6, I lost two days almost to figure out how to solve the problem, shipping was fast but unfortunately the KO phone. I needed the phone with some urgency, I was screwed. If the ignition problem had not happened to me and I would have used the phone regularly I would not have known about the date of its "first ignition", I would have lost 6 months of warranty on the mobile as well as I would not even have been able to do the application.

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Grey	DavidAlan1988	5	I was a long term android user.	2018-07-14	uk	I’ve been using android and pretty much nothing else but since 2010. So I’d just like to say that if your thinking of making the switch, do it.The iPhone 8 Plus is an expensive way to start, but the one thing I didn’t want to do was downsize my screen. Coming from a huawei p10 Plus I was used to a very quick phone. The 8 Plus is just as quick through general navigation and use I’d say, but blows gaming away with not only the A11 chip but just how well games are optimised on iOS. The device oozes quality but I will say you definitely want to look after it. A good case is a must as well as a decent screen protector (plenty of both on Amazon).What’s it like as a phone? Calls are great. Very clear calls every time. Texting? This was an annoyance for me on android because even third party keyboards for me are not as good as the stock iOS keyboard. I can confidently type with my eyes closed now and mistakes are very few and far between.The camera(s)? The dual 12mp setup on the Plus is more than capable of taking brilliant snaps worthy of printing and sharing. I can’t tell if it’s down to the true tone display or the camera but pics do appear a little on the warm side. Nowhere near as harsh as the likes of a galaxy s9 though.Making the switch... Android is a great mobile OS for a lot of reasons. However here’s my reasons for now preferring iOS:>The layout. I love the clean straightforward look of iOS. Sure android is more versatile in this field, but I always found I could never settle on the same look for very long. I just don’t notice this anymore.>No repeated or needless apps, I got so used to being forced to have multiple keyboards media players message apps and gallery’s it became senseless having stock android and then the manufacturer apps together. No need for launchers or anything 3rd party anymore. I think the system apps are just that good.>Freedom to uninstall. On my device almost every app bar the core apps can be uninstalled at the tap of a finger. Another major of annoyance of android, it’s great having multifunction devices but not when your bogged down with so many you don’t even use.>Amazing battery life from iOS now. It’s a fact that iOS used to suffer from poor battery but I just cannot wear this phone out. Even games don’t drain the battery by very much, I am very impressed.	0
iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	sanhchez	4	Very good, but overpriced.	2018-01-23	de	I received the iPhone 8 a few days ago as part of a contract extension. I switched from an iPhone 6s, which is now two years old, to the market in September 2015. The chip is a bit older and also the exterior is different from that of the iPhone 8. But that does not matter to me, since I always have an envelope around my cell phones so that they are also protected in the event of a fall (haha) from falling damage , Has always worked. Oh well. I'm counting now the pros and cons that have struck me so far from the iPhone 8 in comparison to the 6s. I would not have gotten any new, my current would not be so full that a data transfer to my Windows 10 PC is completely impossible, also many apps after a while no longer supported by older models.Another reason for buying was that the bundle with mobile phone was only slightly more expensive than a pure contract without a device (Muttchen is happy, if I leave her my old device) Advantages: + beautiful new glass back, but should be very vulnerable to scratches - therefore maybe only a short time beautiful + pretty gold, a mixture of the ocherstichigen gold tone of the IP6 and the rose gold of IP6s / 7: on Reddit it has even caused a surge of enthusiasm, some have sold their Space Gray model to the The phone back looks different depending on the angle of view and light, on my 1st Photo, made with the IP6s in dark hallway and with flash, it looks, for example, white, on the 2nd rather creamy + comparatively handy ( Nevertheless, the 5s was better for my Winzlingshände suitable) + improved chip + charging through Qi (although you still need to run this charging station via a socket, wodur ch for me the advantage already omitted) + allows Augmented Reality (for me personally not significantly) + Apple manufactures m. E. very valuable equipment, my daughter once poured her milk next to my cell phone - but it is still fine, once had a Samsung Galaxy S2, on the shell of a single small drop of water, the part was over + supplied accessories makes one high-quality impression - in the past, the headsets with me always easily survived two years, which was definitely different with Samsung and Nokia; The AC adapter from the charger (USB to plug) is no longer smooth, but fine "rauhfaserig", it feels so more robust and does not seem to be as hot as the old 6s + iOS GUI is personally appealing to me that of Android, also iOS is less prone to viruses u. Ä., But iOS is but rigid and has little customization options, which I do not care, because I find iOS more understandable than Android, Windows Mobile or - the almost ancient - Symbian ^^^^^ Disadvantages: ^^^^^ - missing headphone jack (jack connector) and still (at least for me) no improved sound due to two speakers at the bottom compared to 6s, you can not charge the phone at the same time while listening to music, because the Lightning connector of the charger no recess for headphones Sony Ericsson has done better since 2007, Apple sells the missing jack again as an innovation, for me that is an immense step into the past - with my use (music, video browsing, image processing, sending messages) I see better Chips no faster reactions, actually the 6s was fast enough for everything, it has never hung, I do not know how much you strain the phone n need to be able to notice a significant improvement over the devices from the last four years (from IP6); with the camera it's the same for me so far: no visible improvements and compared to the camera of my friend's Samsung it still stinks off - True Tone is comparable to the color matching of my Nokia Lumia 925 of 2013, so is not a novelty and sometimes even annoying for the little memory very expensive, 64 GB depending on the areas of use of the phone can be quickly full-bzgl.Apple, not the phone: iTunes compulsion, constant updates, since the last update, you can disable Wi-Fi only in the settings, but not in the control center ("WLAN disabled until tomorrow", who comes up with such stupid ideas ?! required for the Apple Watch and other applications ... but only clones the battery.) - The Apple batteries are generally extremely poor compared to those of other manufacturers, charging twice a day is not uncommon, although the phone is only in standby My conclusion: For the "usual" social network usage and selfie photographers, the predecessor models are still more than adequate and now cheaper to get. The phone is great, it's fast, looks good and will probably last a long time (subjective experience), the display is also acceptable. I am even glad that the same is not frameless, that would get on my nerves and I think the iPhone X, for example, totally ugly. Probably I'm just too spoiled by the 6s, so I do not appreciate the subtle changes to the new device and standard use. For the few, what has changed (meaningful!), I find the price hardly justified (ie the EIA by Apple). My purchase decision was based as I said at the beginning on a contract extension, on full memory of my old device and on the fact that its battery just barely persevere, without being forced to carry a charger in his pocket (despite stagnation and airplane mode). It offers for me compared to the 6s barely noticeable improvements, rather even the impractical deterioration that exists since the 7: The missing jack socket, because Apple beyond iTunes again needed an extra sausage. But there is ultimately just a star deduction, taken together with the short battery life, it has even lowered the mAh value compared to the 7th. I can not understand it. The Apple devices are very resistant, otherwise I would have long since looked for another manufacturer - but I can not imagine that a Huawei, LG or HTC would survive my everyday life as an Apple (because of shell and foil Dents, scratches and "Spider-App" completely alien, the 6s has already survived falls across a platform, if someone has run into my headphones). If you are looking for a mobile phone, because the 5 and the 5s will hardly be usable in the near future, a 6s or 7 is just as well advised, but should compare the prices before. For the normal EIA and without a contract, I would not buy the 8, not to camp because of the opening in front of an Apple Store, as is customary in some places.	0

The camera is in comparison to other devices pure mediocrity and from the IPS 68 certification of the iPhone 7, Apple itself does not seem quite convinced (or why else the warranty committee?)

I have contacted Apple who told me that I have to contact the seller, and amazon told me I have to contact apple. It’s very unfortunate this has happened with me and I do not want to keep the phone. It’s best to buy straight from Apple.	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Walter	4	Great product! A single flaw ....	2018-07-26	it	Then the product is great as we all already know, only one flaw that made me a little expire the seller .. nothing that anyway I gave 4 stars, but this iPhone 7 has a slight defect of speaker which is given by an update .I bought it for a customer who trusted my professional skill .. when you told me about this defect I immediately contacted the seller to take advantage of the warranty and I didn't like the answer very much. Answer by seller (the product is covered by Apple's official warranty, take it to an Apple store). Thanks ok, I solved it this way because one is 5 km away but not everyone has an Apple store 2 steps to take it is fix it in about an hour. 4 stars because it deserves them	0

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Mik217	2	From iPhone 6s to XR? D rather not!	2019-04-29	de	First of all to me iPhone 4, iPhone 6s- Usable features: One-hand mode by double tap, 3D touch, Touch ID, opening the camera via control center, power saving mode permanently on.- large hands- Most used apps: Snapchat, Whatsapp, Facebook , Instagram, various games, news appsPlus: ++ Design, case size, weight +++ operation + touch ID criticism at 6s: --- very low battery life (at least 2x load a day) (now 77% battery power, but power-saving mode always on + Stromfresser like Bluetooth and Wlan switched off on the way) - screen size too small- speed, resolution, camera not up-to-date (but personally I do not find sooo annoying) - soon no more updatesThese annoying problems have moved me to pick up a new model for some years now One day I had the iPhone XR in use and can say the following things (not purchased on Amazon) ++ Battery life top (very much use: games, Bluetooth and WLAN perma nent on, rumprobieren, etc.) and had 10h use still 40% + speed: the apps open much faster, and the display recognizes the inputs much faster. + Of course, the camera is better than my old 6s + color and optics (Back side): the matt aluminum frame and the darker black look very good. + I did not miss the 3D touch as the haptic touch covers 90% of the functions. But now on the negative aspects: first, the ones that bother me less: - Design (front): The Notch I personally do not like, if I hold the XR transversely to watch videos. The thick edge makes the iPhone appear a bit cheap in my opinion - I personally like the fingerprint sensor better than Face-ID, since you always have to raise the phone to unlock.- The cases for the XR on Amazon are so thick that of there can be no question of transparency. Very thick, milky and make the iPhone additionally unhandlicher.Nun to the annoying stuff in my view- As I have already mentioned very large hands, but I consider the XR including sleeve with one hand to use as catastrophic. It's heavy (weight), with the thumb you can never reach the top edge (open control center) and activate the one-hand mode (with a wiper down) does not always work or quit alone before you could perform an action (especially in Snapchat conspicuous) - I have a constant feeling it falls out of my hand.- The low resolution compared to the Xs or X (pretty much the same price) does not justify the high price. Conclusion: After a day, the XR migrated without signs of wear and polished back, because immediately shell and protective film were attached. Even if the display is nice and big, the camera / speaker notch reduces the feeling. The most important thing with my smartphone is a simple and fast operation with mostly one hand. That was impossible with the XR. For such a price, I expect more. In some places you can still notice that the software has not quite adapted to the notch. Furthermore, I personally miss the home button, due to the one-hand mode. And with hindsight I could have dealt with Assistive Touch. And maybe that's just my impression, but somehow the display seemed cheap. I like to use my iPhone 6s and am a fan of the operating system. I now have some concerns about an X model (due to much better battery life, updates and better resolution). Since the X is smaller than the XR, I think the handling will also be easier. Unfortunately, the XR failed with me.	0
iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	miknkia	3	From the perspective of a former Android user	2017-07-03	de	For a week I own the iPhone 7 Plus and am satisfied but not enthusiastic. Previously, I only ever had cheaper smartphones (Android). But my last cell phone got on my nerves at some point so that I wanted to buy a new one. This time I wanted to treat myself something high quality. First, the choice should fall on the Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. Since I did not like the quality of the phone but I bought an iPhone 7 Plus.Bisher I had only heard good things about the iPhone 7 Plus and decided relatively quickly for me without informing me more. However, that was a mistake, because only afterwards I noticed the following negative points: - The Iphone has no back button (super-nervous, because you can never go back a step, if one has clicked, bad luck.) - The battery does not hold As long as promised, it will last a maximum of 8 hours with mediocre use. My Asus Zenfone, with whom I was not satisfied, kept much longer.- I can not delete a letter when I am committed to a word, but I have to rewrite the whole word - very time-consuming.- The Appstore has far not to offer as much as the Playstore.- the Iphone costs a whopping 850 ¬ and I see no significant difference to a 250 ¬ device. The surcharge is not worth it. What I've noticed positively: - the camera has a good quality- the operating system is fast- noble design- Siri and Facetime are goodies that are fun and that only exists on the Iphone. The iphone is in my opinion very overpriced and offers simply too little for the price, since other cheaper mobile phones are just as good. I would not get it again. The next phone will be an android again! Do not understand the hype around the iphone at all.	0

Overall I found this phone a disappointing experience. Apple still running further behind the competition. See the OnePlus 3 and the MI5 for example. What remains is a trusted and stable iOS experience.Pros- finally 32GB order of 16 GB as the minimum variant- easy iCoud- stable- Device may just bring the plane :-)Cons- no physical home button, very irritating feeling- missing headphone jack- price- no LED notifications- no fast charging- no back button	0

iPhone XR	128GB	White	Matt	4	Very good battery life and performance.	2019-04-07	uk	This is a great iPhone. The (close to) edge to edge screen is great for video and the stereo speakers are fantastic. Speakers are an area where Apple are really excelling in their mobile and laptop ranges. The LCD screen isn’t noticeably worse than an LED if you’re the type who dims it to save battery life anyway, which incidentally is better than any iPhone I’ve had in recent years. On low power mode, you could push it out for almost two days on light use. The camera is very good, although the portrait mode will look noticeably fake to any photographers who have shot with real low depth of field. It’s a shame this doesn’t have 3D Touch or a fingerprint sensor, but the phone still performs well. Build is great and as usual for a modern iPhone, it’s waterproof enough to survive most household accidents. But the compromises to make a cheaper iPhone means that unlike the thundering specs of iPhones like the 7 which beat most of the competition, there’s a lot of cheaper Android competition with a better spec on paper. Some much cheaper from the likes of Honor. If you’re agnostic as to which OS you like, shop around. But as an iPhone, I have no real complaints.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	angelika	3	Error after 6 months use	2018-11-19	de	After 6 months of use of the iPhone, problems arose on the screen. Concerning. The seller contact was informed that a factory setting was helping. This was done, with the result that now about 2 months later the same glitch occurred again, so that the iphone was sent to the seller within the warranty. It was quickly a message that the Iphone is no longer functional by a shock. The Iphone has never been dropped or encountered other objects. Now statement stands against statement and an assertion was expressed, which I can not disprove. It could also be that the Iphone already had a shock damage and therefore was sold ... The fact is that you now have an Iphone still worth € 300, which is not functional and would have to be repaired at their own expense can only advise from brought "" Handy's "" !!!	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Vincenzo	3	Apple: a clearly overrated brand	2019-04-22	it	Ever since the iPhone 6 came out, I've always wanted to buy one, but I've always considered them "unreachable" because of their disproportionate prices, but some time ago, when I saw the iPhone 7 Plus, I fell in love with it, so I began to consider the reconditioned 16-gigabyte iPhone 6, precisely because even the new 6 / 6S cost so much (it costs so much even today, compared to its release date) also because I needed to buy a new smartphone, but since I am a man of great patience, I have waited months and months and in the end, having the possibility of being able to spend a little more, I bought here on Amazon the 32 gig iPhone, at a price of € 411.14 (it was on offer , at full price, even today, the 32 gig model costs almost € 500) with the awareness of the multiple limitations that Apple products have, that this iPhone 7 is now technologically obsolete (we are talking about a 2016 device) and for the trouble that I have had since not po ssiedo an Apple ecosystem, but I bought it because they are better than most Android devices because of their hardware / software optimization and because I love the graphics / effects / fluidity of the iOS system, but in a short time I regretted having it purchased. Why? Even though like everyone, I have always been aware of the limitations that an iPhone entails, trying it for myself, I realized that Apple's is a real dictatorship: or you adapt to their absurd rules / limitations or not if does nothing! Making simple operations, such as transferring files from the iPhone to the PC and vice versa, really becomes a mangy procedure. When I was recording a voice message via the WhatsApp App, the phone warmed up a bit behind, and I don't think that was normal. After almost a month that I had it, I discovered that my copy was "" affected "" by the so-called "Coil Whine" effect, that is the noise that you can hear by resting your ear near the applied Apple logo on the back of the device itself. When I was talking on the phone while it was plugged in, I could hear a sort of interference noise from the earpiece, like those that emit radios when an old phone came up. Always the ear-plug, it gave out a remarkable rustling while I was on call. Finally, only with a few Apps and a quantity of music that went just beyond the jig, I had already arrived at about 22 gigabytes. Unfortunately, all these things have led me to make the return and return to Android, with which I can do everything with extreme simplicity, but above all it is a device that is more recent than two years, has more memory, moreover expandable, is borderless (full screen) and it cost me less. I love the graphics and fluency of iOS, but the game is not worth the candle!	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Cliente Amazon	3	Telephone ok, so-so company	2017-08-30	it	The phone arrived in no time and in the original Apple package. Now I have had it for a couple of months and it is working quite well, the only thing is that it overheats every now and then while I use it and I can't understand if it's a normal thing about the iPhone7 or if it's a problem with this phone in particular. I am rather unhappy with the company: I had to write over and over again before I received the receipt, and when I wrote asking what to do about the overheating problem, my question was almost ignored. In the same way I am struggling to get a precise answer on how to return during the warranty: when I asked how the additional guarantee of them works (at the time of purchase I was assured that there is a one year Apple warranty and a year with their company) they only told me to send them the phone, completely ignoring my repeated questions about the address and the procedures to follow in those cases. Is there perhaps little transparency? In any case, the phone works quite well, for now it only got me down once and I hope it's normal and not due to the model. Ave where we have only been for a couple of months.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Shoppingphantom	2	Not as good as the 6s	2019-07-09	de	I've been using iPhones 3, 5, 6s, and now 8, which I did not buy from Amazon for years. But I think the Amazon is the best 'consumer channel' for a review. I've been using the phone for about half a year, and basically it's still a great smartphone but not as good as the 6s. But there are a few points that are really annoying: - The missing headphone input. Of course, there is a matching headphone and an adapter with it, so that especially perfectly organized people have no problem with it. Unfortunately, I can not bite, and of my many headphones fits now only one, and that, who is currently not there, and the adapter, I also constantly misplaced.- The GPS reception in the car is not working properly. It sometimes takes minutes for the phone to hear that I've turned off. It is probably a common problem with the reception, which is discussed on communities, I had so far only time to worry about it and have no solution- The new home button is also getting used to. He has no more resistance than at the 6s and often he just does not react. One presses desperately repeatedly until something happens.We still wonder that sales of iPhones is weakening. Perhaps Apple executives should increasingly think about whether they are acting in the interests of their customers. Incidentally, this also applies to the further development of iOS. Personally, I would wish for many features and Apple apps, the aspect of simple and straightforward usability back into focus. The two stars explicitly include the comparison with the previous one.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Dinin70	2	Unjustified price ...	2018-07-05	fr	Purchase not checked because received for work.Les plus: - it is pretty-the screen is very beautiful, nothing to complain about. The colors are vivid.- excellent reactivity of the screen. But nothing transcendent, any smartphone half the price has the same responsiveness / fluidity - the battery is long. Two and a half days in high use but no games.- sync mails / outlook / contacts less broken head than on Android.- excellent camera.Level of flat keys: - no micro SD- no button. Extreme slowness at the level of manipulation. We want to close an application? Press for a long time at the bottom of the screen, long press on the window, wait until the small red crosses appear, close one by one applications.- without buttons it is also necessary to do additional manipulations to navigate from an application to the other, to go back on a web page etc.- nice facial recognition but if it does not work (glasses), you have to wait until recognition does not work, wait to put the code etc ...- obligation to go through iTunes to listen to music.- headphones without jack cable. So you have to either discard the iPhone headphones and use the jack cable adapter to iPhone, or have two pairs, one for the iPhone, one for the computer ... To conclude, the battery, the screen and the camera is really at the top, but tedious navigation (what is faster to do anything on an Android ...), the headphones unusable other than on the phone, and the lack of flexibility at the level of music and storage make the price is absolutely not justified and is there only to give some exclusivity to its owner, which is ridiculous.Je have not had other phones too high-end but I'm certain that for € 3-400 less (which is extremely expensive) you can enjoy the same quality without having to suffer the limitations imposed by Apple	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Jonathan Shore	2	Not as good as the 6	2016-12-28	uk	I'm sufficiently sad to have had every iPhone model that's come out - and am no fan of Android phones at all. But...the iPhone 7 simply isn't worth it. I have an iPhone 6 for work so can do head-to-head comparisons. Now maybe it's because the uk iPhone 7 has the apparently rubbish intel chip, but the 6 outperforms the 7 significantly in two key respects - mobile signal reception and wifi reception. I park the two phones next to each other and while the 7 struggles to get signal, the 6 is happily connected.Whatever else a smartphone is meant to do, making phone calls and going online is where it all starts from and in this respect the 7 is a  wry expensive fail. The camera however is superb, can't begin to say how much better the pictures are - a real step forward in quality.But for the basics, the 7 doesn't live up to its price tag and I find myself having to use the 6 on frequent occasions (travel a lot for work) because the 7 is floundering. Can't deny that although I will probably be in the queue when the 8 comes out I feel really let down by the 7.Yes, it's waterproof too but given my absentminded habit of giving my phones regular rides in the washing machine, I'm not sure it's that waterproof. The 7 is a bit like visiting an Apple Store at the weekend - it looks fantastic but is ultimately totally frustrating because you can't get any service.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Ernest Grewe	1	In weak mobile network reception unusable!	2016-12-26	de	My wife has been using an iPhone 3GS so far and was very happy with it. After a few days of falling, the disc splintered, I thought it was time to treat her to a new smartphone. After a short discussion about the requirement profile, we decided on the iPhone 7, because according to various tests and user opinions it should have a better reception than the 5 or 6. (We can judge the comparatively bad reception performance of these devices quite well, since I have only the 5 and now use the 6) The delivery was Amazon-typical fast and easy, the look and feel of the new iPhone is perfect, the installation - as Apple usual - unproblematic and schnell.Aber then unfortunately the disillusionment came. We live on the Land and have gotten used to having a less than optimal network reception (whether D1, D2 ...). With the 3GS, my wife was able to make calls anywhere in the house and on the property without problems, with the new 7 Series this was no longer possible. Either looking for a position on the window, then there not move as possible or renounce on the phone ... both are not really useful alternative, if you have to use the phone for work almost continuously. Since my wife is also traveling a lot in rural areas, so anyway often has to struggle with weak network coverage, the iPhone 7 is unfortunately unusable for their purpose of use. What good is the ease of setup, the trouble-free networking with Outlook, the appointment coordination in the company or other gimmicks, if the rudimentary basic functions are not usable? For me it is incomprehensible that Apple does not manage it over device generations to get back an acceptable reception performance. Other manufacturers have the issue under control better and it just annoying when everyone around one can easily make phone calls or send messages and you sit with his noble phone on the dry ... Since phone in my opinion, still the essential function of a basic Is mobile phones, I can not award more than a star despite all the other positive features of this device, especially since Apple apparently this problem does not take seriously for years seriously! The iPhone 7 goes back to Amazon and the old 3 Series is repaired.	0

The phone is not externally in very good condition as it was written in the description. Whoever owned it before me must never have used a cover because the phone has a dent in every corner. As far as the operation is concerned, the phone goes very well, I see no difference between the new and the reconditioned. The battery seems to me Discrete.	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	ML	1	New iPhone defective - problems with the battery charge	2019-04-07	de	Premium Price - Premium Product? Unfortunately no.My new iPhone XS 256GB, freshly unpacked, charges the battery only sporadically. The Lightning connection often has to be put in and out several times, it's just a matter of luck. Overnight, the battery was e.g. only about half charged and then the battery charge was interrupted with the Lightning charger plugged in. With another out and reinstecken it went on. For a smartphone beyond the 1000 € an imposition. I was with the device at the Apple dealer site, there the problem was also recognized. On-site software updates were performed, smartphone reset, restarted - nothing helps. It was offered to send the 2-day-old iPhone for repair - I refused and made use of the right of withdrawal. After a short googling that does not seem to be an isolated case.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	nexus-hh	1	They are crazy, the Californians ...	2016-09-25	de	The iPhone 7 has now been delivered directly from Apple, but goes back again. It's brave to bring such a smartphone on the market and then not even available, statement in the Apple Store Hamburg Jugfernstieg, "" Since you have just daily from 6 clock watch online, if you can reserve one, we know not, when or which ones come "". And after this statement, the disinterested hip staff was already gone again. The iPhone 7 sounds audible, not only when you hold your ear directly, but also from a few centimeters away. The display has a slight yellow cast for me, does not look brighter than the 6s. The smartphone will be warm, even when it is not busy, in a software update even hot. The missing headphone jack is annoying, as previously assumed, the sound with adapter slightly worse. The included headphones have always been out of the question, who gets those things properly in the ears, the sound and the quality are miserable anyway. The display edges are still incomprehensible too large, Apple is giving away a larger display area. Battery life is bad as usual. In addition, the phone rattles like crazy when you tap lightly on the back or it touches in the upper part, loose parts? In 2016, I find only HD resolution and no fast charging cable too brave. It is outrageous Apple to offer a smartphone that is not available for sale and that has so many (quality) problems. Quite apart from the completely overpriced price, I therefore advise: Stay away. In addition, the fingerprint sensor also works miserably.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Uwe P	2	Bad reception in the GSM area	2017-03-22	de	Actually, the iPhone 7 should replace my iPhone 4S. But unfortunately, nothing came of it. The device went back to Amazon today. Because of the miserable reception in the GSM area. (D2 network Vodafone with me). I live in an area with unfortunately weak mobile network expansion. Where I have with the 4S 2 reception bar, it fluctuates with the iPhone 7 between network search and 1 reception bar. Telephone calls without disconnection are unfortunately hardly possible with the iPhone 7 here. After more than 1 hour of extensive consultation and some checks with the Apple Support, the recommendation was made to send the device back. Since the technical checks of the support could not detect a fault with the device, it seems A reception increase by future software updates is unlikely and I can not guarantee synonymous Apple, so returns. In areas with weak network expansion, I can not recommend the iPhone 7! Where a good network expansion It may work. I have now ordered a 6S, which, according to Apple Support, should not have the problems.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	Kyriakos Zaritis	4	In-depth review of iPhone 8	2017-11-08	uk	Another year has passed and a new iPhone (well this time three to be precise) has been released. This review will look at the iPhone 8 in-depth and rate it in a few main categories, such as display, camera, etc. At the end, there will be a summary that will include the advantages and disadvantages spotted and my personal opinion on whether you should upgrade depending on your current iPhone model (if you wish to just see a brief overview, please skip to the end).DESIGN 8/10Ever since the iPhone 6 was released, the design of the iPhone has more or less stayed the same. This isn’t necessary a bad thing as when you first pick up the new iPhone, you will be shocked by how familiar it looks, but it is slightly frustrating that they could not be a little more inventive and switch up the design of the phone. The main change is that the front and back are glass (reminiscence of the iPhone 4/4s) and an aluminium frame “stitches” the two pieces of glass together. It’s cool and beautiful, but we’ve been seeing something similar for 4 years now. As a consequence of using glass for the front and back of this phone, you will notice that it is slightly heavier (at almost 150g) which makes it not only less slippery but gives it a more premium feel to the device and is also less likely to attract fingerprints (due to its oleophobic coating). This year’s iPhone has rolled out in only three colours for the standard and plus models: space grey, silver and gold.DISPLAY 8/10It’s exactly the same with the display of this phone, as it has been “recycled” for what feels like forever. The 4.7 inch Retina LCD display has a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch which is good, but the same as older models. However, this model has a wider colour and brighter display, but this isn’t new as it was also in last year’s iPhone 7. The only difference between the display of the iPhone 8 and ANY older model is the True Tone display which adjusts the display in terms of white balance, brightness and colour temperature, depending on your environment. Pretty cool.OS AND SPECS 10/10The iPhone 8 comes out of the box with the latest iOS 11 and despite being quite buggy when it rolled out, it now runs fantastically smooth. This device is future-proof as it will receive all OS updates for the next 3-4 years. Apart from that, another reason why this smartphone is future-proof is its specs. It has a hexa-core Apple A11 processor which is Apple’s latest and currently the market’s greatest (Benchmark scores can confirm this). It also has 2GB of RAM which is enough for an iPhone to run smoothly and two internal storage options of either 64GB/256GB. My personal opinion is to go with 64GB and save a bit of money as it is more than enough memory for the average user/consumer.CAMERA 10/10Despite being identical on paper to last year’s, the new iPhone outperforms its predecessor in the camera department. It’s a single lens 12MP camera with an aperture of f/1.8, autofocus and a quad-LED flash. It’s as excellent as it is every year with improved quality and detail, especially in low-light conditions. Colours are more vibrant and objects/people look more accurate than ever. The iPhone 8 can shoot 4K video which is awesome and surprisingly stable (it does have OIS) and professional for a phone. The front camera has 7MP with an an aperture of f/2.2 and a Retina Flash and selfies look clear and smooth.BATTERY 9/10The iPhone 8 has a smaller battery than the 7, yet still manages to slightly last longer due to it’s excellent optimisation. The new iPhone has a non-removable 1,821mAh battery which lasts a full day of heavy usage. However, competition has been pushing the boundaries in terms of power and the new Samsung Galaxy smartphones can last two entire days of moderate/heavy usage! Still, let’s be thankful that Apple is slowly making progress in this department and have even implemented wireless charging. Wireless charging is a cool feature but, due to being unbearably slow and charging only 15% in 30 minutes, I prefer conventional cable charging. This phone does have quick charge but you do have to buy a different cable and plug from the Apple Store which is honestly pretty disappointing! Especially considering EVERY brand that offers quick charge, offers it without if’s or but’s (having to buy additional cables).EXTRAS 8/10Not much to say about additional features as almost everything is similar to last year’s. It’s IP67 water-resistant at 1m for 30 minutes. It does include NFC but, as always, can only be used for Apple Pay. However, it does include Bluetooth 5.0 (although there aren’t many Bluetooth 5.0 accessories just yet) and stereo speakers, which are the loudest on an iPhone.OVERALL 8/10Like every year, this is an impressive new iPhone with additional features. It’s familiar and lightning fast with an incredible camera that outshines its predecessors. This phone, despite its bezels, does feel futuristic as it is Apple’s first attempt at a fully wireless smartphone. In theory, this phone has completely eliminated the need to use any ports for charging or listening to audio and although Android has done it first, Apple is forcing us to make use of the wireless technology out there… And I guess, we don’t really have any other choice.PROS +Beautiful, all-glass design+True Tone display+Lightning fast processor+Incredible camera, even in low-light+Good battery life+Instant unlocking through fingerprint sensor CONS-Similar design to previous three models-Need to buy additional accessories for quick/wireless charging-NFC only available for Apple Pay-Still only IP67Coming from an iPhone 7? Major additions: wireless charging, double storage options, True Tone display, glass design, slightly better battery. In my opinion, you should not update unless you always buy the latest and greatest, or you are a photographer/blogger (in which case, buy the plus version). This is because there are not enough major changes from the model you already own and I personally think it’s a waste of money but go ahead if you want to.Coming from an iPhone 6s or older? Yes, definitely update. There are more than just a few additional features, you will not regret this.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Clemens M.	4	3.5 stars due to some bugs.	2019-06-14	de	I ordered the iPhone X here on Amazon last November, because unfortunately my iPhone 7 Plus gave up the spirit a bit surprisingly after 2 years. First of all, the positive features: 1. The face recognition: I appreciated this feature only when I first had it on my phone. It just makes life a little easier if you can just unlock the phone with "" "", especially with the newly launched in Austria "" Apple Pay2 "" is an excellent thing which I do not want to miss , The OLED display: The display is probably the biggest strength of the X compared to my predecessor. The colors are stronger, especially watching videos on Youtube or something really much more fun. Also the Notch did not strike me as negative, the new gesture control (because without Homebutton) I had internalized within a few days. The camera: Granted, the dual-lense of my 7 Plus was already great, but the camera from the iPhone X makes another jump here. I'm by no means a professional photographer, I'm only taking pictures or photos for my Instagram with it and I have to say - as easy as with the camera of the X I never liked to take good pictures. Also my so filmed concert videos look great, I will attach here from reference which. Now to the negative aspects: 1. Battery: The battery is noticeably weaker than my 7 Plus. I really have to recharge every night, admittedly I listen to a lot of music and am occasionally on various social media sites on the go, but I have at least half a day longer with my 7 Plus - presumably shows the OLED display here negative pages.2. Reception: I often had reception problems or Wi-Fi problems. The Wi-Fi and my provider are still the same as in my 7 Plus where these problems never occurred, I also use the original Apple leather case for the X. Is only a small flaw, but sometimes I noticed and I wanted that too have mentioned.3. Bugs: Unfortunately, since I have the device I have an apparent software bug that sometimes at Whatsapp or iMessage the touchscreen does not respond to an input of a particular letter (always another one). I have been here several times in various Apple stores and MacShark, the device has no defect, the touch screen works 100%. Unfortunately, an exchange of the device is only possible if I send it in and thus I have to spend up to 3 weeks without a smartphone - here I would like something like the earlier express exchange service from Apple, which is no longer offered on demand of my part.FAZIT: If not the annoying Softwarebug and I would not hang so often s.der charging socket I would immediately give 5 stars, the device works lightning fast, no matter how many tabs are open, the new camera is amazing and have the new features such as face recognition, OLED, etc All in all, I am very satisfied, but I would still like to have a device in this price range then just yet I have a low-battery downgrade compared to a 2-year-old device and the otherwise ingeniously simple software works more reliable ,	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Susann Roßberg	2	No chance against Samsung!	2017-04-16	de	My personal opinion about the iPhone 7plus 128 GB results from the handling with the device. I was already disappointed in the unpacking, because the device, from the point of view, was clearly below my expectations. The device can not be used without SIM even! The next sobering point. A device for 900 ¬, which can not even activate via Wi-Fi and a SIM for the initial installation requires is already brazen.The reception was at the same location 2 bars (points) worse and instead of LTE, there was only 3G. Audio files from the PC could not be transferred to the iPhone because the phone is not recognized. A Syncronisation went only over iTunes Store at the PC. At the same time 3 albums have completely disappeared! The device has the very good and bright display and the decent sound via headphones, which unfortunately can only be connected via the cheap adapter. Simultaneous headphone operation and charging the battery does not work. The launcher can also be personalized by far not as in Android devices. The missing "" return "" button was the k.o. Argument, because you just push away apps but not really close. The device goes back. My first iPhone was sobering! Where does this hype come from?	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	stefano c.	4	we were expecting this from apple, but ...	2017-05-29	it	The sales package is slightly different from the usual. Inside a 1A charger output, a USB / Lightning cable, an EarPods headset with Lightning connector and an adapter to use headphones with 3.5mm audio jack. The design is very similar to that of the iPhone 6 except for the earpiece , larger to also accommodate the second system speaker. The camera is slightly shifted to the left and is now 7 megapixel with stabilization. The side keys are a bit less recessed in the body and the SIM drawer has a small gasket to protect it from water and dust. The aesthetic differences are more noticeable on the lower part where the 3.5mm audio jack disappears to make room for a mostly aesthetic grid where the main microphone is positioned. The main speaker and the Lightning door remain in place. Aesthetic innovations also on the back. The separation bands of the antennas have been partially eliminated and the camera has a softer design, protected by a part of the body. It also improves the flash which is now a Dual Tone with 4 LEDs. IPhone 7 is water and dust resistant with IP67 certification even if damage from liquids is not covered by warranty. To offer better resistance, Apple has also redesigned the home button, which is now no longer clickable as usual but is able to recognize finger pressure by offering tactile feedback that we can customize by choosing between three different intensity levels. The button is capacitive and cannot be clicked with objects or if we wear traditional gloves.	0

I would knock this drecks cell phone in the bin, if it were not my company phone ... The missing AUX connection is a joke. You need the annoying iTunes on the PC to download music to the phone. The power is supplied by something you once again only found in Apple, which is why it is not so easy to borrow from a colleague the charging cable. The phone does not seem very sturdy.	0

That was too risky for me then. Then I canceled the phone, which unfortunately did not work. Therefore, I will refuse to accept tomorrow. I take the 1-star rating because I like all interested buyers u.U. Give a good tip: If you order the phone, it should be unpacked in the BEISEIN the delivery. This one is then insured, the content should be missing and you have no circumstances with a refund. To Iphon itself: class. I bought it today in the store and am thrilled.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Tech-Noir	4	Iss OK	2017-04-25	de	Had so far the 5s. Then I wanted the SE. Because of more memory and technology - is just inside newer - find the feel of a 4 inch really pretty good. I decided then for the 7, because the display is just a little clearer - use a lot of Navi. We do not need to talk about the price anymore - either you can do it and swallow it or leave it alone. I still pulled off one star, because headphones in Bluetooth could have been quiet instead of this dongle and cable; if already the socket for headphones is missing. Whether the cell phone - and how long - also works under water, others may test. I do not think anyone understands me underwater anyway.	0

iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	StrammerMax	3	Only partially convinced	2019-03-06	de	I myself have the iPhone XS and have each got an iPhone XR for my parents. In general, I'm very convinced of the device, however, there are some restrictions in comparison to the XS, which bother me. The performance is identical thanks to the same processor (good). But especially in terms of the resolution, I'm disappointed. The fact that the screen is again larger than that of the XS and the resolution is significantly lower, you can see a clear difference. Especially in writing, the margins of the XR seem significantly blurred. Also with the picture quality one notices the missing second camera. In poorly lit rooms, my parents also had problems unlocking the device via Face ID. When you switch from Android to iOS, it's the missing "" back button that makes life difficult. Depending on the application, the arrow is down times, sometimes up, sometimes right, sometimes left .. that is sometimes really annoying.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	sm	1	Beware of 'UK Supplies'	2017-03-07	uk	New phone ordered Friday, arrived Tuesday, and appears to be genuine and new, happy with all that. However after opening I noticed a sheet in the package stating that the phone will work with any network but once a SIM card is inserted the phone is then forever locked to that network, going on to say that if you are not happy with that then send back for full refund. That information should be in the description before purchase not a surprise on opening. And in any case I had already opened the phone. That is not what is generally understood by 'SIM free' and the answers to the questions that have been asked do not mention this locking so definitely deliberately holding back information. Nul points from me.	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	MG	1	The weaknesses of the iPhone reveal themselves in detail.	2019-01-19	de	Well, I'll try to make it short. I owned the following iPhones: 3GS, 4S, 6, 6s, 7 plus and this one here, which will be the end of the journey in the Apple Cosmos. Incidentally, I use an iPad and a MacBook Pro. I do not want to go into the technical specs, which is easier to read on technical pages. For me, it's about the shortcomings of this rigid and now completely unthinkable operating system. What used to be advanced is now dusty and regressive. Some details: Siri, totally useless - "Siri navigate me home" Siri: "here is home address: street name" She does not provide the simplest things Shortcuts, the new Apple app as an automator replacement for the iOS is just laughable. 4 useful shortcuts are available, everything else is not possible due to the restrictions. The settings are now scattered completely confused: automatic brightness of the screen is not found in the screen control / brightness, but under a submenu 30 kilometers away, because of Apple is intuitive. Nevertheless, iTunes is the basis for synchronistation on the mac and on the pc, the old Romans have already used it, and even they were already annoyed by it.Landscape mode does not work well and takes a lot on most apps unnecessarily Place away - completely embarrassing support of the top models. (Not xs related) Hand off (model overarching work) works completely unreliable, sometimes not for weeks, then again. Any individualization of the operating system is impossible. Turn off wifi does not mean: wifi off. Price is now unacceptable, even if the value stability Well, I could go on forever ... and that's why it will probably in the future, which is still far, a leak out of the entire Apple cosmos mean. Certain things are just too much of a good thing. Can others do better? Let's see .. but the most basic things you should already be able to trust the almost most valuable company in the world at this time - but this seems clearly too much to ask.	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Black	André	4	Abstract Iphone 7	2017-09-25	de	I got the iPhone 7 32GB silver in the media market at the start of the sale for € 760 and will now give you some important details about the device and share my personal experience with you.1. Display: One strength of the iPhone is the 4.7 inch display. The display is extremely bright and you really have the perfect picture quality in all lighting conditions. That's just awesome. So this display is really very stable in viewing angles. Battery: The battery lasts a day very difficult. Most of the time I have to recharge it for the day. However, this leads to the fact that I always have to take a break while using it, so I can charge the Iphone. Since I talk a lot, like to listen to music and occasionally watch videos, I have to charge the device again and again, because the iPhone is the day (with normal use) not persevere.3. Memory: I'm glad that Apple is finally a little bit over time and in the basic version offers at least 32GB of memory. Less would be synonymous really out of date and at 32GB I currently have around 14GB of free space, which is at least sufficient for me. I always transfer my photos and videos to the PC and music streaming is usually or delete them again, if I've heard enough. that the next largest version but then already delivers 128GB is in my eyes a little bit fierce or here Apple wants to bring one again, again put it on € 110. I do not think that's good, but the price / performance ratio is ok.4. Operating SystemWith the latest version of iOS, I'm generally quite satisfied, but here I still have the most to complain about. The interaction between Hard & Software seems to have worsened a bit, because despite the high performance of the A10 Fusion chip and the 2GB RAM, I had micro-stutters in some apps or the iPhone has not always responded immediately to my input. Also, when updating apps in the appstore, sometimes it does not work right now and the process stops and you have to restart the upgrade. This happens "" still "" relatively little and I sincerely hope that Apple here in the future nachbessert (perhaps with iOS 11?). Also, I find the whole design a bit boring now and as it looked the same when switching from iPhone 6 to 7, the joy was rather muted. But what iOS 11 has already promised everything makes me feel positive for the future. Camera: The cameras in the iPhone 7 solve now on the back with 12MP and on the front with 7MP and very important; In addition to the iPhone 7 Plus, now has the small version of an optical image stabilizer. The pictures are really good and the color representation is really great. Thanks to the optical stabilizer, videos in motion are now much quieter and no longer as blurred as on the 6 (s). In the dark, although still a fairly high noise can be seen, but that was more with the predecessors.I'm really glad when switching from 1.2MP to 7MP (front camera), because here the difference is really enormous. Finally, you can shoot really good selfies with the iphone and that the entire screen serves as a flash is also extremely good. Speakers: Finally, finally, the iPhone 7 has stereo sound and can compete in this segment with devices such as the HTC flagship series. So far, in my opinion, it has always been modest to hear music or video on the iPhone through the speakers, but that's more or less over now. The speaker in the earpiece is not as strong as the conventional one on the bottom of the phone (and you can hear it), but the sound is currently much more homogeneous than before and I really appreciate the iPhone 7 for that. If you still support the apt-x or high-resoluiton audio (I know there is Apple Lossless), that would be perfect.7. Performance: Inside, of course, has done a lot and the iphone 7 has now an A10 fusion processor with 4 instead of 2 cores and 2GB Ram RAM. However, two of the four cores are only there to do more power-efficient tasks, so not all four work at the same time. Although the performance is noticeably faster than the A8 in the iPhone 6, but apps are not opened so much faster for my experience, as I have imagined. At Whatsapp, e.g. maybe the difference is 1/2 second. The A9 of the 6S should be even less difference. In the power-saving mode, the iphone 7 is still very fast, but you can tell the difference when launching apps (Pokemon Go needs a lot of power) already very much. I am therefore largely satisfied with the performance, but if there was no contract renewal I would not have had to change it. Price: The starting price of 760 € is far too high, in my opinion, for the fact that the device offers only 750p resolution. It has already noticed in the meantime, that even the variant with 128 GB of memory was temporarily offered for 666 €. This price is already justified, the price for the 32GB variant would also be about 110 ¬ lower or in my eyes would definitely have. The current price of about 500-550 € for a used 7ner would be in my opinion for a new device perfect. Positive GPS is quite inaccurate (seems to be a known problem of the 7 Series models) -AkKuleistung is not optimal- older headphones you can Conclusion: With the iPhone 7 you get a modern but extremely overpriced device, which scores with a few features but also has some weaknesses. As far as the price performance is concerned, the cell phone did not convince me. Although I can understand that one pays the brand name here. But with the price level you expect something more. And the difference to an older model like the 4s (built in 2012) is not that huge. Who does not depend on Apple products and does not necessarily need a cell phone as a status symbol, is better served with much cheaper Android phones.	0

iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Anonymus	1	Top smartphone, gruesome phone, performance strange	2019-07-04	de	I try to keep it short and sweet. The smartphone itself is great. Valuable processed. Display on my part completely sufficient, performance impeccable and service also great. I come from the Galaxy S8 myself and was a little disappointed with Samsung's battery packs as well as the abysmal update policy even on Google's Pixel phones. But why am I going to pull a shipping sticker to return the cellphone from Amazon? Permanently comes a jerky, loud Schmatzgeräusch. This is only noticeable on my side, regardless of VoLTE and occurs only on phone calls and not on Whatsapp or Facetime. My interlocutor does not hear anything. The basic function of the phone does not work, that's just not to understand for me in such an expensive device. Repeated full reset without backup did not solve the problem. Other sim no solution. If one searches "" Iphone X / XR / XS Crack "" one finds also some threads both in Germany as well as with linking in the USA where the problem is described and also Youtube videos exist. So it is not an isolated case and repeated exchanges are described there as unhelpful. The Apple support itself knows except "" ... give it in the repair "" no advice. Furthermore, a significant stuttering or judder is noted when Apps are re-opened and you scroll in a newly opened menu item. This affects Whatsapp, DB App, Instagram, settings, images ... speak it is not specific to the app but overall. Here, too, search for iphone stutter and you will find plenty. Update: Exchange device knows at least so far no pop / smack or jerks when telephoning. Will show if this remains so. A relatively loud background noise remains. The Iphone6 ​​or Samsung S8 is completely quiet in comparison, both when not said and when spoken. Luck or stutter when scrolling through newly opened pages (contact list, Whatsappchat, Instagram, settings list ...) still available. Supposedly IOS13 should run better in the beta but honestly, I would not like to test it out now and should be half a year after release sowas already solved.Update 2: Ploppgeräusche are synonymous with the replacement device with Vodafone, Otelo and Telekomsimkarte. I'm sorry but there I grab my head and evaluate another star.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Gregorina	1	iphone is finally not working and seller is not responding	2018-11-06	de	I bought this iphone and immediately it was not working, upon a contact with the seller, he exchanged for another new one.  That one had faulty speakers and I went to apple for warranty, they changed the whole front panel.  Few months later I noticed that speakers were again down and went to apple again, this time apple exchanged for the whole new iphone, which again did not work from the start but unfortunately one year warranty by Apple expired.EU directive imposed a two-year warranty period in the EU and if if manufacturers warranty is limited to one year, the seller should be responsible.  This iphone is a bit older that a year, I tried to contact the seller few times, Amazon customer services contacted seller twice, this seller ignore all.I will have to deal with Amazon now, because it is set by law that there is a two year warranty for products sold in the EU, especially for such costly ones.As for apple... I somehow think that minor retail shops get unsuccessful batches of apple products (lets say the ones that apple cannot expect for sure that all the manufacturing conditions have been fulfilled in a full form).This is my first problem with apple products among iphones, ipads and macbooks but I also never bought before through internet.  I guess not worth it!	0
iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Dirk u. Antje	3	Now IOS? From Symbian to Android to iOS	2016-05-28	de	I'm changing from Symbian to Android now iPhone.Also the iPhone never crashes completely. If, then it is more of a program that hangs. But I miss the real fm radio. That's not the case with Apple. The support for memory cards and stick are not really no not here. No automatic redial when busy and no additional apps no speed dial. At Symbian gabs already sprachwahl and read from messages offline !!!!. That does not exist anymore. The compatibility with other Android devices is still not available via Bluetooth. With apps, data can be exchanged via its own hotspot. Videos can generally not be uploaded to the iPhone without the help of a PC, unless you take them In the Appstore, the free apps are very limited or provided with a lot of advertising, these are sometimes very intrusive.For Android, there are in my opinion a lot more free useful apps that makes life easier. But who wants to have a secure device is well served with any iPhone. However, one is definitely a bit more restricted with its traffic.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	LosSantosGamer	2	Really bad!	2016-09-19	de	Oh man ... Apple. Every year a new iPhone, but never 1 year with a technical revolution. The iPhone 6 had an HD display for the first time, at a time when other manufacturers like Sony have already worked on 4K Panel. I really liked the design back then. An iPhone, which consists entirely of aluminum, except the front, was a house number. Only the antenna strips ... what are they for? LG does not need something like that, Sony does not need something like that, even Samsung did not need something up to the S5 and it does not look good either. So there was a lot that Apple could have improved on the iPhone 7. Now it's here! And it's a huge disappointment. I do not expect a revolutionary smartphone every year, but the iPhone 7 has nothing new to offer that other companies have not had. The display once again resolves to 1280x750p. In addition, it is as usual only 4.7 inches tall. Since the sharpness has not changed. What was improved are the colors, but I liked the iPhone 6 very well. But by the fact that Apple made the colors again more intense, the display of the iPhone 7 seems oversaturated. Similar to the Samsung Galaxy S4. Black and white balance against alright. Especially white has succeeded. But the colors are too thick. As for the pixels, you can not compare it to a Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which I tested at the IFA and has the best display on offer. The panel of the iPhone 7 is pixelated and out of focus. Even the Galaxy S3 convinces thanks to the S-AMOLED technology in spite of lower resolution more than the iPhone 7 In terms of processing and design Apple was already in first place and the word "" was "" applies today, because the design like not me at all. Hardly a trace that it is the 8th (?) Generation. From the front, it is identical to the iPhone 6s and only the rear is a difference noticeable. The antenna strips have now been moved upwards to get a nicer back. But it does not look much better than its predecessor. But a nice selection has been added, because you can now choose between matte black and piano black and both looks classy. The battery is typically not changeable Apple and the memory expansion is missing as always. There are now 32, 128 and 256GB available. The SD card slot is missing as with any Apple iPhone. But at 256GB you need no Speichererweiterung.Der battery has a capacity of 1960 mAh, which sounds like extremely little and is so. I was allowed to test the iPhone 7 so far 1 week and in these 7 days I had to charge the smartphone 10x. And that's just too much.When the device came back to me, I had to charge it twice the next day! Example: For the Huawei P9, I only had to load 1x the next time and then every 2-3 days. And after the battery life was fully utilized, it kept half a day of moderate use. Honestly, at not even 2000 mAh, I expected no other result. The main camera resolves with 12MP. The pictures in daylight excellent. Sharpness, color, dynamic range ... everything really top. In dim light, the images become blurred and there are fewer details that turn into image graining in the dark. However, the pictures are still usable at night. To the camera of the Samsung Galaxy S7 does not approach the iPhone. The video recordings are in spite of image stabilization z.T. very shaky and in videos also grain in shadow corners is minimal recognizable. The microphone, which automatically activates video, is a disaster. Noise, sometimes too bright, sometimes too dull. Bass does not exist at all and a slight crack is heard in minimal wind. Apple advertises the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with the hitherto fastest smartphone. Of course, only since the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was taken out of the sale due to explosion hazard. And I have to say that I really like the performance here. Apps start and close almost in record time. In addition, iOS 10 once again tidier. At least I barely discovered Bloadware. Very good Apple! Generally, the performance is the best you can find on the iPhone 7. Unfortunately, the device gets hot relatively quickly, so often the camera is not activated. But fortunately this is very rare auf.A special features are not so much. 3D touch, fingerprint sensor and 3.5mm jack plug removed. For this, Apple has included headphones with cables, but with an adapter to plug them into the USB C port. Sounds contradictory and it is like that. It seems to me that Apple itself does not believe in their Bluetooth headphones.3D Touch works the same way as the iPhone 6s, but I never used 3D Touch. In addition, the iPhone 7 IP67 certified, so protected against dust and water. In the test, the waterproof worked well, but this feature is also not new. In conclusion, the iPhone 7 is not a really good smartphone. It has positive things like the big memory, the waterproof and the great performance, but the battery is not good and the display for the year 2016 is too pixelated. But I think that iPhone 7 Plus can do better. And if the imense price of more than 1000 € for the 256 GB version was even lower, the iPhone 7 would still have earned 3 stars. But that leaves 2 stars left.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	TheoStar	4	iPone 7 vs. iPhone 6 - not a must, no groundbreaking innovations, rather a "outdated" 6s	2016-09-23	de	I have used the iPhone 6s so far and have now received the new iPhone 7. I am a former Android user and have always got on well with my HTC Oni Mini 2. Ie. I am not an iPhone disciple and I prefer basically. Here I describe my subjective impressions iPhone 6s, 64 GBNew model: iPhone 7, 32 GB ** Mobile ** The devices are basically identical. You can only see through tiny details what the 6s and what the 7 is. I decided against the diamond black, because it looks scratch-prone. At first it looks very noble, probably not very long in my mobile phone use. I have now the matte black and am very satisfied with it. Overall, the iPhone 7 makes a valuable and stable impression. ** Speed ​​** Here I recognize as a "normal gas consumer" hardly a difference between the two models. The processor in the new iPhone 7 is supposed to be much faster than the 6s, but I notice no difference in everyday use. Hanging and stuttering, I do not know the iPhone 6s. Possibly. CPU speed can become an issue in complex (3D) games. If you do not use the mobile phone for this, you can do without the 7 in my opinion. ** Camera ** The camera is the main reason for me to swap the 6s for the 7, because I film a lot with it. The optical image stabilizer brings a good improvement on videos compared to the 6s. The stabilizer was installed in the 6s only in the plus version, d. H. my 6s did not have this yet. Here I see a clear improvement and that is a great win for me the 7ers. The photos of the main camera are only a few shots better than in the 6s model. Especially in low light conditions can be seen here an improvement. Otherwise not. For amateur / amateur photographers like me, that's barely noticeable. Although the flash, color space and the aperture are improved, but I think that brings little if you have no professional claims. The front camera has been improved from 5 to 7 megapixels. Here are better selfies possible. ** Where is the Homebutton? ** Here's Apple's a new way - the home button, as you always know him, is gone. This is simulated on the touch surface (including vibration), as you know it from other phones. For me an advantage: a mechanical part less, which can break. I have often heard of older models that at some point the Homebutton had to be changed. The only point of criticism: in winter you have to take off the gloves to use the homebutton. I'm getting along well with the new development.** Headphone jack?!? ** Apple goes here also a new (innovative?) Way and renounces the old (dear won) jack. There are a few Lightning headphones and a Lightning-to-jack adapter included, d. H. you can connect to the connection headphones, which actually charges the phone. Sound technically I recognize as a hobby listener no difference. Alternatively, you can use Bluetooth headphones. Important: Use Lightning headphones and at the same time charge the phone does not work, because you only have one port on the phone. ** Battery life ** The model 7 is designed to run up to two hours longer. I do not notice a huge difference, but the iPhone has to go to the charger every night anyway. Here you should not expect too much. ** Waterproof Case ** Apple advertises the iPhone 7 as dust and waterproof for 30 minutes and to a depth of one meter. At the same time, there is no guarantee of water damage, as before. Ie. Apple does not pay when the water sensor strikes the inside of the device. Although I believe Apple, that the 7 Series is waterproof (he). However, I will not do a deliberate test for warranty reasons. Should the phone ever fall into the water - unfortunately it happens to me from time to time that it falls - then I will post here if it survived. ** stereo speaker ** The new stereo speakers are louder and a little clearer than the speaker in the iPhone 6s. In particular, the increased volume, I think nice. But here, too, no miracle of technology is to be expected. The iPhone does not (yet) replace a good sound system. It is and remains a mobile phone. ** CONCLUSION ** The change from iPhone 6s to iPhone 7 makes only limited sense. Who is satisfied with the 6s and not urgently the faster processor, the slightly better camera or the (almost) waterproof case needs, should wait another year on the iPhone 8. The announcements promise something totally new, while the 7 is more or less an outdated 6s. Update 14.10.2016 I have now photographed and filmed at several concerts and compared with the pictures of the discarded cell phone 6s. Here you can see slight advantages in low light conditions even on unprofessional photos. The videos are getting a whole lot better. Even if that is probably negligible for hobby relationships. I'm happy about it. I did not have to check the waterproofness so far. Luckily. The phone is stable and easy.	0
iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	nichtl	5	Is the switch from iPhone 6 to iPhone 6s worthwhile?	2016-01-10	de	I've bought every generation of iPhone since the iPhone 3GS (costing around $ 150 a year if you buy / sell it at the right time). The advantages of an iPhone (very reliable, simple operation, extremely good workmanship, great synchronization with OS X) I would not like to mention here again, for the reason most people know this already and I have them in the reviews on the previous iPhone models already I would like to discuss here briefly, whether the conversion of a still very good iPhone 6 on an iPhone 6s is worthwhile and the not so obvious difference herausstellen.1. QualityIn this I was not satisfied with the iPhone 6. It somehow felt "cheap", condemned, was not stiff, everywhere it gave way. Switching directly to an iPhone 6s, you realize that it is much more stable. You do not see that it is a little thicker, but it feels it immediately (I think). It does not creak any more, moreover it is a bit heavier. I like, it finally feels as solid as the other iPhones.2. New featuresHere I can only call 3D touch as the only one. All others (faster Wi-Fi, etc.) I consider negligible, because it was already hoppladihopp on the iPhone 6. 3D Touch is a feature which, typical for Apple, is already deeply integrated into the system. You quickly get used to the resulting shortcuts, it works perfectly well. I can not think about many well-thought-out features anymore (for example, the keyboard turns into a "touchpad" at fixed pressure, which can move the cursor as you type) .3. Speed ​​Can not really say that it has changed. Whether the apps start 0.1s faster, is not really relevant for me in everyday life. More RAMEtwas, which is really helpful! The open apps are now partially in the cache for days and are immediately available when called. This clearly differentiates the 6s from the 6 and is also really useful.5. AkkuI think it's not so nice that the battery is smaller, but I have not really noticed any of it. The duration between the charges is still outstanding - you do not need any trickery or eternal system maintenance. I've made "Backgrund App Refresh" for everything but Whatsapp (no other app really needs it), which adds another few hours. In moderate use, the iPhone easily through 2 days durch.Nach as ugly: The only criticisms remain for this iPhone. That the camera stands out, is very annoying. Constantly tilts the device. Similarly, the plastic antennas are a design flaw. Personally, even more RAM (3 or 4 GB, why not ?!) would not be bad at all. But that's no reason not to buy it. Conclusion: Yes, I think it's worth switching to the 6s. The better quality, 3D touch and especially the RAM are things that you appreciate in everyday use!	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Chris	2	Apple never again	2019-04-28	de	On the phone itself everything is fine. However, I would like to write my disappointment. It's my first and also my last iPhone. The only reason I keep the device is because it allows me to calibrate my Sonos system. In my opinion, according to the current state of technology, a few things are missing on the iPhone or Apple does not consider it necessary to offer the customer a service. In the App Store, it is not possible to test apps. It means, buy it or leave it. I think there is no one who has not yet experienced that an app is not running. In the Google Store every purchase app can be tested 2 hours. It's not possible the iPhone, which has rather a smaller display, with only one hand to operate. Although Apple offers the screen virtually to bring down, but that is awkward in daily use. It simply lacks a back button or short key. The camera: Is good, but simple knit. I miss the feature that front and rear camera simultaneously take a picture and put it together. The panoramic function is only portrait, not landscape! I use SwiftKey, again Apple limits the function of writing. On the iPhone, I write a lot slower because the intuitive features of SwiftKey are limited by Apple, some are missing. Apple is forcing its users to use two-thumb spelling. And Siri is dumb compared to the Google Assistant. I have to narrow down a topic in advance. For example, if I'm looking for a street I have to tell Siri to search the internet because otherwise only the phone will be searched. The Google Assistant uses every opportunity. I do not use Siri any more. There are other things that are annoying, but that's probably my subjective opinion. Two stars, because the design is successful. Maybe that helps one or the other decide, if he wants to change to Apple ,	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Jet Black	Oscar	3	I Still Miss The Headphone Jack	2018-03-17	uk	This phone is meh. I know that’s not really a word but it’s what comes to mind when I think of the iPhone 7. It’s meh. It’s okay. It’s not the worst phone but it’s certainly not the best.  The build of the phone is good. It feels good in the hand and it’s comfy to hold. The phone is a nice decent size although the display wouldn’t hurt to be a bit bigger to shrink the obnoxious beazels. There is one major flaw with this phone though and that is the fact it misses the headphone jack. For some people that might not matter. But for me it matters intensely as a lot of my time spent on my phone is spent listening to music and yes you can listen to music on this phone with Apples supplied headphones but the moment you wanna charge your phone and listen to music you can’t or if you’re watching something on your phone you can charge at the same time. And to me that’s a big deal breaker. Aside from that the build of this phone is magnificent.  The softwear on this phone confuses me. It’s simple to use but it confuses me in the sense that it develops bugs and then fixes them by itself. The phone is almost self healing in that sense but the problem is it’s causing the problems in the first place. And every time apple release a new update there seems to be a massive bug realesed along side.  The camera on this phone is amazing though. It’s simple to use and takes amazing photos. The problem is it’s kind of too simple to use; it lacks a pro mode unlike other phones like Samsung’s. The speakers on this phone are not half bad. But theyre not HTC speakers. But they get the job done and do it reasonably well. Overall this phone is good. But it’s not amazing. If you can afford to I’d recommend splashing out and getting the iPhone 8 as it seems a lot better than this one. Or not I would definitely recommend a Samsung or the iPhone 6 as they both still have a headphone jack.	0

iPhone 6S	128GB	Space Gray	Vijfcent	2	bad reception	2015-10-22	de	I am getting black right now. In the Apple Store, I ordered the iPhone 6s 128GB and put it into operation today. I use O2 Multicard and of course I have the old iPhone 4s lying next to the improvements directly to see. All fine; 3D touch, Retina display and of course a lot of nice gimmicks. The mobile reception is very sobering; Both iPhones have the decibel indicator (iPhone Field test) set up, and the age-old bone has a paltry 20dB better reception (see picture). The crucial difference between being able to make calls or not. I have been extra waiting for the "" s "" model since in this case most of the negative aspects have been improved. Of course, I have created similar circumstances. Comparable settings (mobile data on / off), both devices with / without case, etc. do not understand me wrong; I do not want to miss my iFuhrpark anymore, but dear hardware manufacturers (and I mean all of them), please make phones again with the phone is also possible again. € 1000, - for a gadget that scolds phone and can not talk on the phone is not OK	0
iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	ChaosLeopard	5	Switch from the iPhone 6 Plus definitely worthwhile!	2017-02-12	de	For over 2 months I've been wondering which device is next to choose from, after spending 2 years intensively using the iPhone 6 Plus. The device itself was a very stable and above all powerful smartphone, but you noticed over time that the speed and the reaction to all controls turned out to be much too slow and delayed, so that I no longer enjoy using it. After years of use I had to calculate future plans, which device I will buy next in connection with a contract extension. Here was the following selection between the respective devices: The iPhone 7 Plus The iPhone SE (very famous currently and for the handy use highly recommended ) or the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE. As a Mac user of many years, I naturally had to consider many factors such as compatibility, in the case of a smartphone that is not offered by "Apple". I particularly liked the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE because of the curved display, which has a resolution of 2K and had a nice look and comfort in handling. Operating in combination with Android 6.0 surpassed all my expectations, and I was very enthusiastic about both software and conditionality with one hand, but I knew that using third party software on the Mac would be difficult, for example, updating or transferring data between the Mac and the smartphone. Due to numerous positive reviews, I decided for the S7.Befor I but the purchase graduated, I tended to iPhone 7 Plus, since I was especially fascinated by the dual camera with wide-angle optics. The pictures look really nice, but there was a big disadvantage compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which I am very annoyed to this day: The PRIZE! At Telekom employees extended a contract, filled out papers and fortunately still the last copy of the iPhone Get 7 Plus 128GB Matt Black.Although the purchase was a significant loss compared to my previous contract renewals including mobile phone change, but this has paid off well! In the course of this review, I would like to discuss various aspects of the iPhone 7 Plus, which make the smartphone to something very special and equally interesting At the end, draw a conclusion regarding all the listed areas. Design: The iPhone 7 Plus is similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 6 Plus or the 6S Plus. It consists of a 5.5-inch screen and looks really beautiful. In contrast to the predecessors, the back of the iPhone was slightly changed. The antenna strips, which were clearly recognizable on the iPhone 6 Plus or the 6S, have finally been removed on the 7 Plus. This gives the iPhone 7 Plus a good impression and a nice look thanks to the beautiful black value, which really stands out in the eye and entices the user to want to hold the device in his hands. For me it is clearly one of the most beautiful smartphones that have been released on the market so far. But it gets me full marks, if one neglects the aspect of fingerprints! Homebutton: A new home button simplifies the condition on the iPhone and responds relatively quickly to the controls of the user. If the user presses the "sensor" button (a button does not exist anymore), the device generates a slight vibration, which redirects the device to the original home screen. Within the settings it is possible to interpret different sensitivities of the sensor which, when actuated, either cause a more intense vibration or completely switch it off. If you want to do without the Taptic engine, you can easily configure it in the settings, but personally I find the new home button to be very successful and offers you what the old home button could not do: it prevents the durability of the home button wears off over time. The Taptic Engine has been developed for future use to simplify the use of the device and prevent subsequent damage at high pressure.My homebutton at that time could no longer recognize the exact pressure force, so I was forced to increase the intensity, which of course was bad for the key. Now you can do without, because the new development regarding the sensor works really well. I really like the Homebutton and it makes the condition of the iPhone enormously easier Speaker: The new stereo speakers have really been provided with excellent acoustics, which sound even deeper and more intense deep bass in the individual, built-in speakers and make progress from the sound Has. My current ringtone is much louder as well as sonorous to hear, which is why many music genres are issued much clearer musically. I like the speakers very well. If you want, you can of course use the included headphones. The new A10 with 64-bit architecture and 3GB of memory give the iPhone again a strong performance boost over its predecessors by up to 50%. The iPhone runs like the world champion and scores a peak in the benchmark. Games and applications are presented very fluently and never fall into a jerk. Even appearing messages during gaming did not affect the speed of the iPhone under any circumstances. It responds wonderfully and seems to be drastically optimized compared to my iPhone 6 Plus. The quad-core processor handles various tasks quickly and safely. You definitely do not have to worry about that as a power user. Very good !!! Camera: The new dual camera with wide-angle optics offers a nice result in terms of the photos taken both inside and outside. The camera works relatively quickly and shows very good pictures even in low light conditions, but in bad light can ambiguous individual Verzehrrungen form, which at the expense of image quality, unfortunately, no longer offer what is normally expected of such a camera. Since I personally liked the shots on the S7 much better, but leave the pictures a great and high-quality impression. 4K videos are like the iPhone 6S possible and look amazingly good, especially if my 4K has suitable screen, with which you can marvel at the videos. For amateur photographers is certainly something good here! Personally, I use the camera relatively little, but I try sometimes times to deal with the creation of photos, as soon as good opportunities should occur.Akkulaufzeit: Strong processor, high memory, good speakers also take the battery power of the iPhone. Since I purchased the device only this afternoon, I can mention relatively little information at runtime. The iPhone had about 68% on the first launch. After 6 hours of use remained a remaining battery of 38%, which I think are good results for such an expensive smartphone. Apple promises in contrast to its predecessor up to an hour longer battery life, which I can not confirm, but I'm convinced that the information was really given correctly. If other evidence contradicts this statement, I add this retroactively to the recession.Otherwise, I'm very excited about the battery life for the already 6 hours. Let's see how much this changes after the fact. Memory: This time around, I was 100% sure that I would access a larger capacity than before with the iPhone 6 Plus, which has put a lot of strain on me personally in everyday life. I switched from the 16GB version to 128GB (ie: 112GB of additional memory), of which 120GB are available to the user when preinstalled applications like Keynote or Numbers are removed. Currently only 8GB including music, some photos, iCloud photo and transferred applications from iTunes occupied, which I was very excited about myself, since I can now claim the memory for memory-heavy applications and prove, without wasting a thought that possibly the memory exceeds its limits. If you should opt for an iPhone 7 Plus (especially for the iPhone 7 Plus), please consider whether 32GB is the right choice. After all, initially 4GB occupied by the system. Whether the purchase is worthwhile, everyone has their own thoughts about it. If you got along well with 16GB, where, for example, a small number of applications as well as small shots were created or only a few media libraries were continuously accessed, then the 32 GB could possibly cope. I recommend all other 128GB version (maybe even 256GB), since the new camera including the functions and applications nowadays take a lot of memory and the system could definitely slow down after a few months due to performance. The more data that is stored on the iPhone, the longer the loading time. Before buying, I ask everyone once to think about which variant applies to you, even if it is 100 € more expensive. Better to have more memory for safety and have no problems than to complain later and be forced to transfer data regularly or even remove. Such a thing disturbs in the long run and can cost a lot of time and nerves. 128GB should be for most standard. I do not regret the 128GB so far. Memory can not be expanded with the help of an SD card like its predecessors. Color: Usually I wanted to buy the diamond version of the iPhone, but users on the internet seem to complain that after a short period of 1 - 3 months, tiny traces of wear or even Yellowed deposits are formed so that the appearance of the iPhone is no longer the mint condition, as it was the case in the beginning. I must confess that the diamond version of the iPhone 7 Plus was no longer available and the seller has instead proposed the matte-black variant. On his advice, I accepted the offer and must confess that the color inspires me as much as the diamond version. For safety's sake, I use two bulletproof glass foils to prevent the device from making huge losses. This is a very expensive copy which I do not want to use "naked". Especially after 2 years Apple again offers an upgrade offer, where the old device can be exchanged for the new one. Significant traces of use, the estimated due to the serious and long-term use can fluctuate up to 50 €, which is a strong loss in my opinion.For the 6 Plus, I got from Telekom still 220 ¬. The 7 Plus will probably cost around € 300 to € 400 if I try hard to be careful. Maybe I'll buy a Case soon, although I like the iPhone quite well at the moment, despite the missing case. Let's hope that after a few months there are no surprises that would disappoint me very much of the product. Now we come to a point that bothers me a bit: The lack of headphone connection made for some users for reviews. The supplied adapter creates a remedy, but I would not like to pose in my spare time with an adapter that fills the trouser pocket again. How this manifests itself in practice, I learn only tomorrow on the train. I find it very disappointing that the headphone jack was left out, although I'm convinced I'm getting used to it. It is also criticized that the sound quality in combination with the adapter is reduced a lot. This, too, I can only determine from a later date. Whether Apple hereby want to draw attention to the wireless peripherals? Summary: Pro + High quality editing + Great new Homebutton + Great speakers + Excellent dual camera with great pictures + Good battery life + Beautiful color + iOS 10 with great new featuresKontra- Missing headphone jack camera images in low light conditions a little noisy Still, no NFC in Germany (Actually a pity: Hopefully this will be announced in the coming months) - High SAR value of 1.27W / KG (Whether this could have negative consequences for humans in terms of medical and biological development can Unfortunately, I do not confirm that, according to the German limits, devices with a maximum SAR value of 1.6 or 1.5 W / kg are dangerous but not life-threatening, so Apple could definitely have done more, but you can basically not have everything!) Conclusion: A successful smartphone if not even the best that Apple has to offer. The performance has exceeded all expectations, the camera offers good pictures and a good battery life for long-term users. The iPhone 7 Plus convinces in different areas and leaves a positive impression. The purchase of the device has paid off in my opinion, and can be recommended without any restriction. For those who can not decide between the iPhone 6S Plus and the 7 Plus, or 6S and 7: Always try the newest option into consideration pull. So you have a longer  support and can use all the features that already exist on the 6S, with the purchase of the 7 or 7 Plus further developed. Personally, I also wanted the 6S variant, as the 6 plus 2 years had accompanied me well and only an increased storage capacity was required, yet I opted for the iPhon 7 Plus to be surprised for the next few years with great new features and Benefit from the optimization in terms of performance and especially the dual camera. All users who use an iPhone 6 Plus should think about buying the 7 Plus. Owner of a 6S Plus I do not recommend the purchase, as the iPhone 6s Plus is still a top smartphone and can keep up with the competition. Owners of older models, "" can "think about a change, if performance losses or lack of storage are not in the obstacle. Otherwise: Clear Buy recommendation! Yours sincerelyChaosLeopard	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Sead J.	1	If you buy Apple product, shop at a mafia!	2017-11-26	de	The worst and most criminal monopoly in the world, who have no respect for their customers. IPhone 7 + 128 gb, in the beginning everything was great, until I realized that the microphone was not working properly. No problem I thought, sent in and the service announces the display was broken and I would have to pay 200 € for a new one. It was a small scratch that did not bother me, I told you that I want a new microphone and no new display. Refused, sent back! Then to the store, spent the whole day there, who said they would like to do it but they have a lock on it that they could not do anything. So again called service and clarify the final, they are stubborn and do not want to swap my microphone. Man has to imagine that, you have an 800 ¬ expensive phone with which you can not call! The bad thing is you do not care about the customer. I have 4 Apple products and they do not think I can offer a solution. I also told you nicely that I will no longer use Apple and disconnect me from it. Thereupon some sarcastic remarks. So man loses customers. That was the last time I buy such items. I am now standing there with a cell phone that I can not tel. Apple does not care that a bit. I advise everyone to buy any device that is worth nothing to the customer!	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Sivan A.	3	Either I'm pretty unlucky, or Apple can not build mobile phones anymore!	2018-01-13	de	It's just amazing. At the beginning of December, after three years of using an iPhone 5, I bought the new iPhone 8. I looked forward to it so animalically, and felt emotions during unboxing, which I had never had before! I was completely satisfied and set up the device. As stupid as I was, I did not pay attention to the outside ... Only the next day, I noticed processing errors on the device. The gaps between glass and aluminum frame on the back were quite large. On the sides they were o. K., But above all a clear gap was felt. I then made use of my right of withdrawal and returned the device. Then I ordered it elsewhere, because it was cheaper there ... Also, this device had similar errors. The gap dimensions were not quite as big now. On top of that, however, the mute switch rattled quite a bit when he was in the top position. I sent it to Apple this time because I thought they would know what to do. But then came the disappointment: they simply sent the device back to me unprocessed. Was added a remark that the device is flawless. But that was not it. I then researched the Internet, and found that other iPhone eight models have this gap. However, I also had an iPhone 8 Plus in my hand, which did not have these problems. Also the problems with the mute switch had two devices that I did not have in my hand. I then really tried to live with these annoying problems, and to accept the whole thing. Now comes to the fact that I noticed now after a few weeks of use, that in the video recording with the main camera a crack in the sound can be heard. But this has only occurred now, in the beginning this was not heard in video recordings. I do not know what to think about it. Apple did not do anything, and now I'm sitting here with this faulty device. It's fast and looks fancy. You have to leave that to him, but somehow I wish I had never switched to the iPhone 8.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Patrick	4	May I introduce: The iPhone 7	2018-08-10	de	May I introduce: The iPhone 7.Jo, an iPhone just. No here should not come any of these reviews, the first basically on the company Apple and the exorbitant price draws to end up with the fact that we are all slaves of capitalism. No, what I want to go out in particular is the difference to the iPhone 6 And the difference between these two models is, well, let's just say it's not groundbreaking: Optics / Color: Yes, the 7's are more colorful now, if you like. This fact will surely be noticed by everyone. Whether this is more beautiful, hip or innovative is sometimes put there. This is not important to me because my iPhone is in a case. If there are people who care about that, then that's okay too. At me no designer was lost so that it should have been to this Punkt.Kamera: Here I think the biggest and most important innovation. The front camera now has 7 megapixels, so far 1.2 (iPhone 6). In addition, in my opinion, the color of the main camera has greatly improved. It also has 12 megapixels, while my 6 only 8 has. Battery: Again, something has happened. The battery got stronger. Now a 1,960 mAh battery is installed. According to Apple, this now lasts 2 hours longer. How long is it until I have to swap this battery, as it was with my 6 also remains to be seen. As much as you like Apple but here is simply the biggest minus point for me. Just buy a new battery, flap on the back and exchange is simply not. No jack for splash-proof: So and now comes the best and yes that's ironic. The annoying jack connection must soften, so that the iPhone is spitzwassergeschützt. Certainly necessary, as other manufacturers have been offering this for a long time.But dear people, now I have to dodge for a Lighting-jack adapter (because I do not mind the best will not buy me these overpriced Earpods) to continue to use my usual headphones. Apart from the fact that the iPhone certainly falls 100Mal more often and breaks down than that it falls into the water. Well, but I live with it but a minus point is this deal for me all times. Display: Yes, there is no physical homebutton anymore. Is located on Spirtzwasser- and dust protection. Nevertheless, I feel the physical signal, which is triggered by pressing the non-existent button as very authentic. In terms of lighting and color strength, I can not find any significant difference, even if Apple represents the otherwise. Memory: You might think the iPhone now has more storage space. It is synonymous but only because the smallest size is now the 32GB. That's fine too, as many certainly had their problems with the smaller variants. But a really innovation looks different in this respect. Conclusion: So dear Apple friends, as the owner of an iPhone 6 or even 6s worth the switch to the 7er certainly not. Innovations are certainly present. These should be subjectively evaluated. For me, I can only draw the following conclusion: What Apple has built up in the iPhone 7 compared to the 6, they have torn at the same time with the butt again (see waterproof vs. discontinued jack). Nevertheless, Apple remains the measure of things for me in terms of the smartphone. Nevertheless, I would change as the owner of the 6er if then on the 8th or the 10th. Although you have to look at it subjectively whether the innovations for a person are really useful or maybe not. I give thus 4 stars. Alone because Apple has remained true to itself. The part is modern user-friendly and fast and in comparison to Samsung simply more valuable. Although a change is not necessarily worth the iPhone is still the measure of things and in the point of security can not be exceeded (my opinion). And you see I have not complained about capitalism or a supposedly overpriced price. As long as millions of these things are sold, it is obviously not covered yet.	0
iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Matthias	2	I love Apple - but THAT is not here at all :-( iPhone 7 the pure disappointment, I stay with the iPhone SE ...	2016-09-21	de	Well, what can I say, I'm really disappointed. As much as I love Apple and like to pay the money. I have a lot of devices from Apple in use and had in the past pretty much every iPhone. Most of the time I ordered it right after the keynote, because I never really could wait and it was well worth it. But since the release of the iPhone 6S, Apple has left something to be desired as far as the iPhone is concerned. I try that - just in terms of the iPhone 7 to justify something. Maybe some people think about that instead of throwing their money out the window ... 1. Less and less novelties - but always more expensive Somehow, nothing more really happens at Apple. as far as the iPhone is concerned. Not just visually, but generally. Apple presents things and argues with things that other manufacturers have long since, where this is already standard. For example the thing with IP67 and things like that. Somehow nothing is doing more - and I think that's a pity. Because there was a time, there it was still very different ... Especially in times of Steve Jobs, RIP. I do not know, I would just wish that I get more for my money than the whole 0815 crap. Do not misunderstand, technically the iPhone is, especially now with the 7, of course, top and there is nothing to complain about it. But does all that really justify such an enormous price of over 1000 euros? No.2. Always bigger, but why the hell no 4-inch version anymore? What I do not like is the growing size! I'm one of many who do not want to carry a brick with them. I prefer the 4 "variant, which was the reason to switch from the iPhone 6S to the iPhone SE again - which makes me very grateful that Apple has released this" special edition ". So, why the hell again only a 4.7 and 5.5 inches version? Why bring an alternative to the big models back on the market, if you destroy them directly at the release of the new generation? What kind of sense does it make? There are many like me who would prefer the 4 "version - you could clearly see on the iPhone SE. For me that's why the 7 Series is not for me in question, much I prefer keeping my iPhone SE.3. Different features to the "" brick "" (Plus model) What should actually this crap with the different features in the models? Why has only the plus the 2nd Camera Lens from the telephoto lens? That's just the whole people fooled. As if this feature could not be included in the 4.7 "version. You do not understand, for all love.The Plus model is really nothing, the part is too big. Even had the iPhone 6S Plus - put it in your pocket in summer when you're wearing shorts. No, just no. Alone half the tablet to hold the phone to the ear, 188g heavy ... No, again no. Nothing for me ... (matter of taste, no question ...) 4. Same design, old technology, where is the innovation?! I always smile when I look at the Apple Keynote on the iPhone. People are blinded by such massive improvements, especially compared to older models. More speed, better CPU / GPU blah blah ... What itches me! Anyone who already knows an iPhone knows exactly that they always run fluffy and never hang! I have never noticed a really noticeable difference. Benchmark back and forth - it does not itch me anything, because you hardly notice it anyway, if you use it just as normal. Camera is the only thing that happens every now and then, if only minimally. But instead of finally integrating this ugly camera lens into the (!) Case, no, they remove the 3.5mm jack connector and only offer Lightning. It does not seem to matter that you can not charge iPhone 7 AND listen to music at the same time. Since you have to (no, you should) just for a sleazy 170.- Euro buy the new wireless headphones ... Yes no, is clear! Back to the camera lens, which still stands out the back, which in my opinion would be really better to solve (other manufacturers manage it): The only reason why the iPhone has not been thinner and slimmer so far, were 2 reasons: The 3, 5mm jack connection as well as the theme of robustness. NOW, I'm curious to see if there's something new next year and Apple finally gets the turn again - or if the scrape really goes on like the last years. I mean hey, that the jack-connection fell off I really do not care, but I want the iPhone compact, thinner, smaller and without a protruding camera lens, so you can put it on the table, without having to use a shell MUESS.The annoying! -Fact is, I will pay no Euro for the iPhone 7, if, then only at contract renewal, I should then get it for free. Because I'm not ready to pay so much money for such a crap. Please do not get me wrong, it may be technically top, no question. But I'm just concerned that people are blinded with tiny things and everyone thinks they have to have that, just because it's the newest iPhone. That in the 7er, however, to 50% the same hardware as in the 6S, nobody seems to bother. That's just not worth the money! One can argue about the size of the memory, I've always found this an impudence from Apple, but it has always been like that. At least they have now finally adopted the 16GB variant, which was really no longer timely. Because after iOS 9 or 10 were already 4-6 GB occupied, so you would like to have just under 10 GB for your own use. But that's a different story, where everyone has to decide for themselves, which one of the storage is ultimately worth or how much you need. I keep my iPhone SE for now, see no reason to pay the significant extra price, only to my neighbors, friends and acquaintances to show that I have the latest iPhone 7, so they all envy me so much. Find it a pity, especially since I take a lot of pictures and movies, I would have liked the new features of the camera - but not under these "circumstances". Who has the money, please. Loss of value at Apple is thank God very low, so that at any time an Apple iPhone can always sell well. The fact that some are currently offered back on eBay for over 1700, - Euro, just because you have to wait on Apple shows once again just the profit greed of the people ... Apple iPhone 7, how should I love you, you have really disappointed me , driven me away from you, you are indeed really chic, otherwise not wrong, but what you offer me now, it is not worthy to me. In my opinion, save the money and keep the iPhone 6S / SE, is just as good. But this is just my personal objective opinion, based on experience and facts.	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Kaufen und Verkaufen	5	My first iPhone, I am very satisfied.	2016-10-13	de	I recently got my first iPhone. Since I'm used to bigger smartphones on Android, it has become the 7 Plus, with 5.5 inch Bilddiagonale.Auf the data sheet, I would not go into, but briefly describe my impressions as Umsteiger.- Case: I have that 7 Plus in matte black. From the processing I am thrilled, the aluminum housing looks great and feels worthy. The antenna strips of the predecessors have almost disappeared. As a screen background, I use the unofficial dark fashion, the device is described on various websites. As a result, the iPhone is completely in black, looks chic. The disadvantage of the 7 Plus is in relation to the screen very large frame and the high weight compared to the Android competition. It is similarly slippery in the matte version as the Samsung S7 Edge operating system: Before my device was delivered, I was looking for iOS operation tips. It should be limited to the current iOS 10 or possibly 9, as of course always something changes. There are YouTube videos, web pages and also magazines. Typical processes, like e.g. switching from the photo gallery to the camera is pretty fast. The 7 Plus runs very smoothly with 3Gb memory. For the first time I use the iPhone fingerprint sensor, which I'll use permanently - because it works so fast and reliably , That was a key reason for buying an iPhone. At Sammy, I disabled it at some point. Also, the location of the device can be set up quickly and I do not have to google the best third-party app for it. When surfing with the Androids there were incidents where I did not trust the device properly. Since I am online banking u.a. I prefer to reset it to factory settings. The security apps, I do not trust so much. On the PC (good security software provided) and iPhone I feel better protected. Installed apps ask the iPhone on the first start, if they annoy me with notifications. Homebutton: Since this is my first Apple Smartphone is, I can not compare to the homebutton of the predecessor. I think it's better to have one, so I was a Samsung user before. With the 7 Plus the intensity of the vibration feedback can be adjusted and I work quite relaxed with it. If it is to be more durable than the older models, I like to take it.- Camera: The camera app starts almost as fast as the Samsung competition. I've set the iPhone so that it displays the lock screen on the Uplift, a short swipe from right to left, the camera is ready to go, zack.Entgegen some "tests" I see the quality of the photos in daylight at least on par with the Galaxy S7. Samsung recognizes the colors of the scene and then neatly pops in the color intensity. Apple is more neutral here. Fine details like leaves and branches are not sharpened and are less pixelated on the iPhone.The autofocus is the Galaxy S7 faster sharp.Größter disadvantage with Samsung S7 is the very short range, which is sharply displayed. This is only a few meters, everything before and after is increasingly blurred. When taking pictures of buildings along the street that is not always desirable, in portraits already. Not a photographer, probably has to do with the larger aperture. The Galaxy S6 did not have this so extreme, as well as the iPhone is better here. At low-light, the quality of the iPhone 7 Plus is significantly better than that of Samsung. The color reproduction is much more realistic. Samsung photos often become extremely yellowish, colors of e.g. Plants are intensified too intensely for the lighting conditions. In addition, details on the iPhone do not disappear as quickly in the Pixelmachsch as with Samsung. Images of the iPhone get a little brighter and show more details. The decimal place at the aperture size brings Sammy no advantage here. Photos in raw format are possible. Note: The "zoom lens" is an asset in good lighting conditions and a reason to buy the larger model. In the dark, however, only the wide-angle lens is used and enlarged digitally. So here better refrain from it or snap with / without zoom and compare. The portrait mode with the blur effect should be redone, example images on the net looked very good to me.- Other: Who does not need the camera features, not to use the desktop mode for surfing or iPhone with one hand, possibly drives with the 4, 7 "better. Try it! - The battery is quite strong and is in no way inferior to the Galaxy. The loading times are longer than the Samsung. After the Samsung Note 7 embarrassment, I'm glad too. The S7 Edge, I was already worried when I installed a BS updates while loading. It was always warm, but the appliance was almost cooked. It was not that extreme on the older Samsung models. - Clever how to use Siri. I find it helpful.- Most Google Apps are available, eg: Chrome, Music, Translate and Maps.- My recorded TV series I get from the PC easier on the device, as I first thought. VLC Player App, do not need to convert, copy and sync with iTunes right there in the VLC menu item, only the first time unfamiliar, then it's quite simple. Conclusion: The transition from Android to Apple was quite simple. I'm very happy with the iPhone and I do not feel I have to constantly switch between the Android manufacturers, because one could have reinvented the wheel. The protection against access from the outside and also within the operating system / Apps is now clearly better. iPhones are quite expensive, if it does not have to be the latest, possibly buy used and unlocked predecessor model.	0

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Daimpi	2	You should think carefully before buying!	2019-04-09	de	Also I did not get the device from Amazon. It was traded to me as a new service phone against an iPhone 6S. Many have already described the technical details here. I would rather comment on the size, handling and feel. Unfortunately, I had no influence on the choice of my new device. The phone is very big. Way too big for average big / small hands. Even in inhand mode, I find it hard to reach the upper left corner. I've been used to using the phone with one hand for years. The XR is a torment. Also, the weight is a disaster. If you put the phone in a bumper, it gets even bigger and heavier. Writing an e-mail is very tiring for the hand. Absolutely unusable. The change from Touch-ID to Face-ID was a bit hard to get used to. But over time, I find it not so bad. The case itself is processed properly. But the sides of the phone are very slippery, so you have to spend a lot of power on a cell phone, so it does not slip through your fingers. The heavy weight is still counterproductive added. If I could, I would send it back immediately.	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Stefan80339	4	Great phone, expensive repairs, frustrating Face ID	2018-12-21	de	In principle, there is not much to say about an iPhone. Nevertheless, a few comments: - same day delivery in Munich has not worked-the first model came to a fault and did not turn on. Amazon was very fast in exchange and has already sent a replacement before I had given up the old.- Compared to the 6 or 7 model, the phone is really heavy-glass repair costs are really expensive, 591 Eur if front and back are concerned. - I do not have the home button, one-hand operation is virtually impossible - Face ID only works moderately. This one must look at the phone pretty directly. Does it not, because it is e.g. lying flat on a table or in a handsfree, then Face ID is not. Does not work on wet hair, head half in the pillow, etc. Otherwise, of course, it is a sensational phone with great camera and mega display.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Benedictu	2	iPhone is pure consumerism, because again there is no good reason to use the latest model for more than a year	2017-02-26	de	Does one have to have the device, if one does not get it just officially made available? The new waterproofness, the increased computing power, the better camera, the larger memory are conceivable reasons for purchase. Who decides on the device, the film Belkin ScreenForce InvisiGlass screen protector (suitable for iPhone 7), which is perfectly centered in the Apple store, and the case Apple MMW82ZM / A iPhone 7 Silicone Case black for protection and preservation of value recommended (see photo), so he gets rid of it in good time before the iPhone 8 at a good price. In the telephony Apple has lost the connection to the top. The so-called SAR value, which indicates the specific absorption rate of mobile phone radiation in watts per kilogram of body tissue, positions the iPhone 7 virtually as the tail light of the competitor field. The SAR reading of the iPhone 7 is still a factor of 1.4 from the limit of 2 W / kg with 1.38 W / kg, but in fact six times as high as some competing models, almost a factor of 10 stay below the limit. Those who often need to make calls in places with poor mast coverage or good shielding will be inclined to wait for an improved iPhone 8 or higher. FAZIT Apple is a rational actor taking advantage of its opportunities. To blame them is therefore as pointless as criticizing a US president or a car brand because it produces polluting SUVs. Because it is always the little man who has set the course by his choice. So as long as consumers are so uncritical about their favorite brands and with rather inconsequential innovations, which are commonly referred to as product care, cheer with 4- and 5-star reviews as in the sports palace, instead of just waiting for the next or next version it will continue for a long time. Also to the detriment of the environment, which is mainly burdened by the production of unnecessary electronics. A high-quality, elaborately produced electronic device, which one can not operate satisfied and with good conscience for some years, but because of its shortcomings better one sees the first best opportunity to get each newer, is a sacrilege. My favorite brand Apple has less to be ashamed of than its uncritical customers.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	michele di fronzo	4	For those who want to know EVERYTHING on the phone	2017-10-25	it	iPhone 8? Three things: charging, grip and sound from the speakers. Which are not really aspects of the smartphone, but features added to the macro-features that already exist: autonomous charging, design grip and multimedia audio. There would be a little drawing to do, so simple to explain. IPhone 8, nice but always the same design since 2015iPhone 8, beautiful but still the same design since 20151. Top-up (wireless) I put wireless charging first because it's the only feature I'm already missing. It seems stupid and of little use, but having a support base on which to instantly load your smartphone is not foolish. For the occasion, I bought a recharge base on Amazon for € 9.99, which I placed on my bedside table in the bedroom. I don't know if it makes sense to take this base on the road, because it would only be something more to carry that would not give a real added value, compared to the normal USB-Lightning cable. I noticed that, with a cable, the iPhone 8 recharges 100% in about 1 hour, and with wireless charging in just under 2, but with the latter method the glass body behind warms up considerably. If it heats up in this period that the outside temperature is at maximum 28 degrees, I can only imagine what could happen in the summer with 40 degrees and more. In any case, wireless charging is very useful, especially since Apple has decided not to create its own standard, but to use the Qi standard which is very widespread.Grip, better with the iPhone 8 backside, grip is better with the shell rear in iPhone 8 glass, the grip is better with the rear body in glass I am trying out iPhone 8 while I look at that frying pan of the iPhone 7 Plus that I bought last year and which now seems terribly inefficient in terms of size. It almost seems that today, after all these models of smartphones with FullVision displays, InfinityDisplay and so on and so forth, "going back" to a smartphone with even a few millimeters of edges is like being back in 2003. As I have already written in the Galaxy S8 review, iPhone 7 Plus looks ugly and old to me. iPhone 8 has the exact same form factor as its predecessor, yet the rear glass body removes a bit of bitterness in the mouth. It is not just a matter of appearance: iPhoneItalia dear Andrea Cervone recently released a video on Youtube which clearly shows that glass resists all kinds of falls, and only yields to absurd falls - like those from a balcony.iPhone 8 doesn't seem to break even if you kick it and hit it against a tree. Seeing is believing. I obviously haven't tried it. Last, but not least, is the audio: it seems that many producers have made up their minds to turn their laptop and smartphone into speakers, because even iPhone 8 earns a good percentage more decibels, if we can say so. The volume is higher than the previous ones and the Galaxy S8, and it's really clean. Yes, it could be a reason to switch to iPhone 8, but not for me for example. And then? IPhone 8 actually has changes under the shell. But they are not very relevant. There is the new A11 Bionic chip, which has a dedicated processor for machine learning (but now is of little use), there is also a renewed camera that takes photos and shoots videos 2% better than the iPhone 7. And on iPhone 8 Plus there is the dual camera with which you can use Portrait Lighting, a mode that acts in real time on the portrait and highlights it, or puts it in black and white, and so on. For now, though, they're all games, the real applications that can take advantage of the A11 Bionic chip are still work in progress. I have said that neither iPhone 8 nor iPhone X are the real news from Apple, because Apple's direction is on reality (increased) - even Valentino, in his article, delves into augmented reality and the iPhone. In short, iPhone 8 is a small step forward, because one step was necessary to do so. Of course, 50% of iPhone users are waiting for the iPhone X because it is the most expensive smartphone for consumers in history (I don't count special editions and luxury smartphones). So, in a nutshell: if you come from iPhone 6 or earlier, iPhone 8 will be a big step forward. Otherwise, go ahead: the revolution has yet to come.	0

iPhone 8	256GB	Space Gray	A.D.	1	Not so good.	2018-10-05	de	Not so good! Have the iphone since March and am shocked how sensitive it is against scratches and cracks in the display and housing. Without a protective cover it should probably never be used. Software is also weak, the preinstalled card app ranges e.g. I do not need any additional apps from the competition. Very little compatibility with other products, sometimes even with those that should be made especially for Apple. Photos of the camera are in good light very good, in low light quite bad. With the standard camera app hardly any settings possible. I will hardly buy an expensive second camera app. Why are not photos taken the same size as the display? There are always edges, with videos it fits. In the beginning, wiping across the screen did not always work properly, which only got better after an update. Actually, I like the device only the performance, until now it runs smoothly and fast. There is just one star. There are deductions for the price, which is far too high. Trigger for the sensitivity. Deduction for software errors that the support will fix late or not. Fingerprint sensor does not work on slightly sweaty or wet fingers. I've read the same finger three times, now it's okay. In advertising, the man drove his skateboard through the lawn sprinkler, in reality, he would not get it unlocked ..... I'll stop writing, otherwise it will be too long.	0

Her screen was much brighter and whiter, and mine was darker and yellowish. Maybe it's a fake or a fake or just a production mistake, do not know. Except for that, but with the phone everything is fine. But would still recommend anyone who wants to buy an iPhone to buy it in a trustworthy business and I will do it in the future.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Yando_SB	4	Opinion of a mobile phone salesman	2016-10-31	de	First of all: I did not purchase the iPhone via Amazon, but now use the platform to write my opinion on Apple's new flagship and give potential buyers an opportunity to buy. In general, the 7er does not differ much from its predecessor 6s, And yet, some changes have been made.And exactly this I would like to address in my review: -The new HomebuttonIn comparison to the previous models, Apple is the new iPhone on a kind of 3D Touch, which is to simulate a physical button by a vibration feedback (Taptic Engine) , Good thing! The intensity of the vibration can be adjusted in the settings, feels good and does not wear out. However, the new "" button "ALWAYS needs skin contact. Not a touch pen, a living finger. Thus, thanks to iOS 10, the iPhone can no longer be unlocked with, for example, special mobile phone shoes, since unlocking with the help of a code always requires the push of a button. New Taptic Engine makes sense and is simply a step into the future. In a nutshell; The engine is the new vibration in the lower part of the device, which also simulates the push of a button. This is also used, for example, when scrolling through a list in the lower part. You know that, "" Enter your date of birth "" and you choose on 3 reels day, month and year. Between each selection, the device vibrates quite easily, as if you turn on the wheel of fortune;) .- CameraIm direct comparison to the 6s you can see no difference. Really no. Maybe if you play the pictures on a 4k TV or print on poster size you will notice a slight difference, but not as a normal consumer. - Loss of headphone jackWill I do not really go into it, I personally it is sausage. Apple finally adds an adapter, which is something you can not argue about. New colors Since iPhone 5 I am generally very skeptical about black iPhones. Of course, the new colors look great, in my opinion, the most beautiful iPhones so far, but I see them scratched and worn after 3-4 months, whether with or without shell. I remember very well my beautiful iPhone 5, which after 2 months (MIT sleeve) had the first bright spots on the back. Powder coating rubs off on a commodity that slides 100 times daily through the fingers. The diamond black iPhone of my colleague had already after 2 weeks various scratches on the back, and he really treats it like a raw egg.- LautsprecherNa finally! Clean and above all loud sound from first 2 speakers. Class, really useful, even if the speaker above a whole corner quieter than the usual main speakers, the entire sound convinced. DisplayGroß praised the 25% brighter display with even more colors. Well, Heller? No. Nagut, not directly. The maximum brightness is achieved only in the auto-brightness mode in direct sunlight, in order to continue to grant reasonably good readability. Also, the new color space can be noticed only in direct comparison slightly, it just looks a bit better.	0

iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	FcBayernGrafBecker	1	Ugly, cheap and itunes heavy!	2015-10-17	de	Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!	0
iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Arne T.	5	Better, as always!	2018-01-27	de	Since the iPhone X has finally broken my pain threshold in the price, I actually felt the iPhone 8 as a very good deal. Just over 4 years ago I paid € 799,00 for a 32GB iPhone 5s and today I get an iPhone 8 with at least 64GB.Now the iPhone 8. You get exactly what you expect. A valuable lightning fast phone with a nice camera and a cable store and yes, the Qi charger must of course to the socket, where else should the power come from? The display is good, for an IPS even very good, but can not with the Amoled of Keep up with X or Galaxy S8. The latter I had before the 8 and thus the display in the iPhone 8 does not seem so outstanding. There is no help for Truetone. But, clearly, worlds are better than Samsung's is the standby consumption on iOS and that's just Apple. On weekdays, I get so loose about two with a battery charge, that was almost impossible with the S8. Next, it is that since the iPhone 7 stereo speakers, which are really okay, depending on the sound source, sometimes even excellent and again a comparison to Find, many times better than the monaural speaker of the Galaxy S8. Conclusion, the iPhone 8 is a total of a top device.	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Kai	4	Super Iphone, old diseases	2017-06-23	de	I rate here the Apple Iphone 7 Plus with 128 gb. Since the Iphone 4, I am an Apple smartphone owner and was rather dissatisfied with many generations. With the Iphone 7 Plus, now everything was done right, except for the old problems. It has a persevering battery life, a really nice size and runs the most stable so far. The workmanship and design are, as always, very good and need not be explained further. I am absolutely satisfied and happy every day that way well, no viruses can implant on my IOS architecture. BUT: The big shortcoming since Iphone 6, which is why I had to apply for 3 replacement devices, was the interaction with software and the charging of the smartphone. I had the problem that my Iphone jumped within seconds from 1% to 100% battery condition and of course then repeatedly went out or restarted. The 4th Iphone was free of this error. So a gross error Apple may actually not unterlaufen.FLUSENKILLER: Lightning connection, all right, but I bet EVERYONE knows it: All of a sudden, the Iphone is not charging properly? NO, in most cases, it's just FLUSES that "plugged" the Lightning jack. This lightning is apparently so sensitive that even a lint is enough to charge a decent load without "" loose contact => Silicon protection caps for about 1 € everywhere are everywhere that can solve this annoying problem kann.I do not know if I will stay with the Iphone, because 2 simple but very annoying problems slowly the fun of this Smartphone series take.I hope my review could help you :-)	0
iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Boris	1	Rather a status symbol than a workhorse	2017-05-28	de	I wanted to get my age rather mature iPhone 4s replace a newer model. Since I use a MacBook to work with the usual compatibility among the devices was very important. So a new iPhone had to come from. Meanwhile, I use the new phone for about 4 months. Positive: -optimal display size-Touch ID is very handy for unlocking the screen-waterproof housing-a pretty good camera-the system runs very fast (although the difference to 4s but not so enormous is as I have imagined) Negative: -GPS is quite inaccurate (seems to be a known problem of the 7 models) -Akka performance is not optimal. After 2 days not so intensive use (GPS, e-mail / write, surf, phone) the battery is quickly empty. Unfortunately, this is not enough for me, considering that these are standard applications and not resource-hungry games. Unfortunately, older headphones can only be connected via an adapter. Conclusion: With the iPhone 7, you get a modern but extremely overpriced device, that with scores some features but also has some weaknesses. As far as the price performance is concerned, the cell phone did not convince me. Although I can understand that one pays the brand name here. But with the price level you expect something more. And the difference to an older model like the 4s (built in 2012) is not that huge. If you are not dependent on Apple products and do not necessarily need a mobile phone as a status symbol, you will be better off with much cheaper Android phones. # Update 2018 #After over 1.5 years, the phone is completely greased.

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Martin	2	windfall	2017-07-31	de	This is my last iPhone since Generation 4's loyal customer! Why? For me, the iPhone has always been a "state of the art" product far beyond the competition, Jobs put a lot of passion in the development of devices next to a status symbol perfection In the point of quality and customer service was clearly noticeable in the first iPhones that this is a premium product. But with Generation 6, I noticed clearly that simply no lifeblood is in the development of the device, camera lenses that "slip" "and allegedly not a reason for complaint are ... just as the service of me hard on technology manufacturer of discounter reminiscent. Positive thinking, but I have decided for the 7, in the hope that it is a mature 6er (because optically has changed nothing), but I already regretted that after a very short time: / Yes the device brings innovations in comparison to the 6 series: - a button that is no longer a button- Forcetouch- Faster processor (who notices it, I do not) - better camera (I notice only in very faint pictures) For it likes to hang up for a few seconds, which I had previously experienced on any iPhone. Sometimes it has also simply do not feel like talking on the phone, and then with "" Call Failed "" word. In these situations, man can enjoy the silence of life, because without the one notices it (network is connected normally), callers are as busy / or unavailable signaled, without which you can even note it. If that was not enough, has my wife, who bought the same device in a different color at the same time, the same Probleme.Für me is the "" fun "" iPhone by the end of next year to extend the contract. Because it no longer embodies what it once was and the competition has not overslept the last 5 years, here was tightened and there are now significantly cheaper devices available that are similarly powerful .... but you pay not here for the name or the bad Kundenservice.Zur rating: I rate here with 2 stars because I product and price link together. Hot, for 250 ¬ I would give 4 stars, because it is simply a "" standard smartphone "" is. At a price of about 1000 €, however, I expect premium and the device is in no wise fair. If my recession has helped you in the product, I would be happy about a "" thumbs up "".	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	B Newton	3	Great iPhone - but please read review for why it only gets 3 stars!	2018-01-24	uk	Great product, great iPhone, massive improvement on all the other models I’ve used. Fast and responsive, everything works great and Face ID is pretty amazing, saves time when using Apple Pay and logging into secure apps/websites.However... I had to return and get replacements for THREE iPhone X’s before I landed with one that didn’t have hair, dust or other foreign particles trapped on the inside of the glass covering the rear camera lenses. Yes, inside - no amount of wiping with a cloth will remove it as it’s under the glass. So, obviously a manufacturer defect where I assume it is not sealed in a dust and contaminant-free environment.

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	egmbh	2	Nice device, but gestures do not convince	2017-11-03	de	At first, I think the facial recognition issue might be a problem, but it works surprisingly well. The screen is great, but pictures and videos look better on the old iPhone just because they have no dent. What I do not like at all are the new swipe gestures. Thus, the entire operation is now overloaded and error-prone. A button can sometimes be really useful, which already had to learn various car manufacturers who wanted to settle everything only on the iDrive.	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Reynolds	3	Great phone but it WILL break.	2019-03-21	us	My first Apple product. Lots of neat features in handling like face recognition and password/login applicability.Very cumbersome with many artificial limitations doing email attachments through the mail application and even through the gmail app.Casing is HORRENDOUS. Looks cool for 4 days but is so slick and slippery that both cases on my phone and my wife’s phone shattered within 5 days. It will slide off your bed/counter/desk/out of your pocket/everything. Apple chose to make the case out of cheap glass. You will live in a state of anxiety given that the included cord is too short for practical use and is still heavy enough to pull the phone off its surface and to the floor several times a day regardless of the precautions you take.	0

iPhone XR	128GB	Red	GrafBuchstabe	5	Actually a great smartphone	2018-11-27	de	Have the smartphone for several weeks in operation. Actually, I like it quite well, but I have to harvest a lot of mockery and malice for it. Many colleagues and friends laugh at me about the device and ask if I have no money for a real iPhone? To be honest, it looks stupid if all their expensive and high-quality iPhone Xs or Xs max put on the table and I have to put my cheap phone next to it, usually I keep it in the bag so that no one sees it, of course it is stupid if it is but rings and everyone sees that I have only the cheap part. So my tip: put the part on vibration! Then you can with each call to weigh if you get it out and give you the nakedness, or not. I'm actually fully satisfied, the display is great, the working speed is a dream, the design is just great and it makes great photos. If it had simply made Apple 400-500 euros more expensive, then I would not have these problems with it. When renewing the contract I was also not clear that I do not get the expensive flagship, I have the Telekk chalk! You just had to tell me that it is the cheap device. So my tip: think twice if you can live with the pressure of society, if you get such a cheap device!	0

To date 17-05-17 I have not seen a penny back. I contacted MIPHONE, who replies once every 3 messages and is therefore very absent, and they wrote to me "at the moment we cannot handle us. The return will be amazon which will do so" ". Absolutely false, I contacted the Amazon customer service who opened a complaint to me saying that the thing is false and if he received the goods he must also proceed with the refund. Draw your conclusions about the seller. I will update the review based on the outcome of the complaint. Update: the AZ buyer protection program returned my money. 5 stars at amazon and 1 at the seller who, evidently, was banished from amazon	0
iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	chrisskirsche	5	former Android userin - hello apple	2015-11-18	de	Hello, Foreword: Once I was Applefeindin, until I came to the glorious idea to convert the Samsung S5 to Cyanogenmod 12. (big mistake), constantly this did not work and that not. In short: I wanted to use the hate product of the Android user itself. With great expectation it came and it has been packed pretty high quality. (which one expects of a € 849 expensive device!) The first few hours I was a little awkward, you can tell already on the start screen. The habit of wiping me up each time (usual due to the Samsung S5 usage), but once you register your finger and use it for unlocking, it's even a lot easier than with the Samsung S5 (often even disengaged as it is never wanted to work properly). The 3D feature has now been useful to me only in the email preview. I still play with it and explore the features that the iPhone offers me so. Even transferring the data from Android to iOS was extremely easy, thanks to the Android app, which unfortunately is rated by the Androidhatern more than bad. So I'm wondering what's going on with people? Others buy sinfully expensive Nike shoes and are not immediately pelted with Deichmann shoes. After the second day of use, I'm desperately happy. It does not jerk, it just does what I expect from the device! Instagram makes me even more fun, even if the camera has less megapixels than my Samsung S5. Who cares? This is more than correct for posting and distributing photos and videos. To "" photograph "", I use my Nikon 5300.Everything in one, I do not regret the purchase. The saving was worth it and I get a super device for my own small needs:) Hope it helped	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Keine gekaufte Meinung.	1	What a disappointment	2018-12-20	de	After the drama with the iPhone X and their display problem, I wanted to give the newer version again a chance. To put it briefly, better take an older model which also works. Apps are mostly not optimized for the screen. iPhone crashes again and again. In the middle of phoning for example. Face ID did not work after the 2nd week, not a new configuration was not possible, more possible because the iPhone did not even recognize the face. Furthermore, the keyboard was displayed in the home screen although no input was required. Calls were superimposed on the home screen. Taking off was not possible. In these cases, only a deliberate restart of the iPhone helped. In this price category just a no-go. And I know iPhones since the 2nd generation (pictures will follow)	0

A bill with VAT ID card was also not there, so that I can now draw no input tax, which makes the device by a whopping 19% more expensive. Dear Amazon, I trust as a customer actually that you protect me from such unpleasant surprises and list only sellers who either supply the goods, which I can expect or who clearly point out deviations in their description. We only kept the device because we needed immediate replacement because of theft, otherwise we would have sent it back. After all, the delivery took place within 24 hours.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	H. Michael	2	Ingenious mobile phone minus sound quality minus radiation minus price	2017-01-11	de	Well, I'm doing it very briefly. I'm in principle very convinced by Apple and I'm not deterred by the lack of headphone jack. It would in principle be a great smartphone + chic design + battery is ok (could be bigger but is enough) + great performance + iCloud and iTunes Convenience + feel engine and 3D touch complete the whole very good as far as 5 stars from me Now come the problems that raises the iPhone with which I honestly did not expect.- 1 star due to the price. I knew that and I expected that, but the purchase still hurts. Unfortunately, my old iPhone was broken unexpectedly, so I needed a new one and thought then I want a "" current "" device. If you then informed and the high-end smartphones of the competition looks like with similar (some better) features for half of the price offered you have to swallow-1 star because of the problematic sound quality ... The adapter ensures losses in the Sound quality and Bluetooth is unfortunately not implemented as you would expect, especially from Apple. Bluetooth is fine with the Bose system. Before that it did not matter because Aux was always available. Now you need a good wireless connection. Unfortunately, e.g. not a decent Bluetooth Aux find adapter, since Apple does not support the apTX standard (Bluetooth in CD quality!) - 1 star deduction because of the high radiation value, I have read randomly online. The radiation value is in the cell phone is well above the values ​​of the competition, Partial Factor 4! Apple himself says you should not hold the device to the head ... More you have to say at this point I think I do not think I'll sell it and get me a 6S or something. Maybe I also dare to jump to Android. Mainly because of the audio quality :(	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Gilles	4	From Iphone 6 Plus to 7 Plus.	2017-02-13	de	Having had almost every iphone so far. At the beginning 3 then 4 and 5 and then the 6 plus. I bought the normal Iphone 7 again after the 6 plus because I found the Iphone 6 plus big. It's hard to decide because of the 2 sizes, If you have the normal then you find it too small and if you turn the big then you say it is too small. I bought the Iphone 7 Plus in the 128 GB version in matt black. From the model it is externally almost identical to the 6 Plus only that there is no headphone connection and that the antenna strips are now better mounted, so that you almost do not see it. I would now not here to go into all the technical details because most users have already written enough. I just want to tell my opinion if it's worth it from 6 plus to 7 plus to change. I think in any case that it's worth it. Alone because of the camera quality. I am someone who often takes pictures and then edited them with an app. I think the camera just great. The shoots so good photos that they are sometimes better than a Dslr.Was I like in any case, really good are the 3 D Touch, I use it very often.Hier times positive and negative points.Positive: Battery (Top ) Camera 3D Touch Matte Black is really very noble and less prone to scratches than the diamond black. Size of the screen. Super if you are surfing the internet a lot or reading newspapers for example. Speakers work much better than those of the old 6 Plus. Negative: Definitely the price. Always the same design. As you see, Samsung is already better in terms of design. As you can see is not much negative. When I look at the Samung Edge 7, for example, looks more modern and the design is better than the Iphone. I had bought the Edge 7 and it after 1 week sold again because I just can not handle Adnroid. Ios this is definitely the better choice. Conclusion: The switch from 6 Plus to 7 Plus is worth it. From the 6 S Plus to 7 Plus, it's definitely not worth it.1 Star deduction I give because the prices of Apple are simply too expensive.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Peter Assfalg	1	No help, just rip off	2019-06-13	de	Unfortunately, I have had very disappointing and bad experiences: After a few years and two android phones, I decided again for an Apple iPhone and bought me in September 2018, a new iPhone 8 for around 650 ¬. I was completely satisfied and fell in love again with the surface, the handling, the operation and the shape. I could not have imagined a better phone ... Until in May 2019 suddenly my outdoor camera stopped responding, my flashlight stopped working and the mobile phone often reported a simcard error. Over a three-quarters of a year, I was very careful and handled the phone carefully. I never fell down and was protected all the time with a solid case and a protective glass. So I thought: A clear guarantee. After a short phone call with the AppleSupport the phone was picked up for repair at my home and was already in the repair center at Apple 2 days after the phone call. In the phone call, I was told that Apple repaired any damage or repaired no damage at all. After a few days, I got feedback from Apple: On my phone, another defect was found, which does not include the warranty and thus expire. There were pictures of the corresponding "defect" attached. These were my loudspeakers, in which was dirt, lint, etc. of my trouser pocket. I already knew that. Anyway, Apple declared this as a defect and demanded for the total repair of my eight month old iPhone a contribution of 317,02 € + tax (!!!!). I feel pulled over the table and unrestrained abgezockt.Warum I pay 650 ¬ for a telephone, which has eight months after technical failures, then I'll even crappy for my warranty and on top of that also roughly ¬ 350 as repair costs for damage that is not in my responsibility is to pay? Why should one still buy Apple products there? For 350 ¬ there are now android phones that have at least as good a performance as the iPhone 8. What I find almost saddest: not a coworker has my actually problem, the defective camera or the flashlight ever accepted. Neither at the 'repair' nor on the phone. It was always about the speaker "defect" and about the fact that I alone have to pay for the repair. I have the cell phone returned unrepaired and have visited a local mobile workshop. I have during the Apple "repair" almost 14 days to give up my mobile phone. An indictment of a company like Apple. Here, as a customer as I have now found, just ripped off. To offer the customer help stands at Apple probably now at the bottom. That would never have been in the sense of the inventor. I am very disappointed.	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Customer	1	Cant wait to go back to android!	2019-05-31	us	I just got my first iPhone ever, and Ive had it for over a month...and its TERRIBLE!-phone volume controls all sound, including alarms, ringtones, media and any bluetooth device youre connected to. horrible setup. especially if you want the Alarm you have set to wake you up, but dont want phone calls or messages to bother you. and for the bluetooth this is really frustrating because you cant use the full volume range of the speaker without distortion of the sound, because you cant balance the input volume to the speaker with the playback volume.-touch response is terrible. about half the time I try scrolling up, the phone scrolls left to the previous page or screen. rather frustrating, and just plain annoying-battery life okay, but not great, especially if youre actually using the phone, it dies fast-camera takes amazing photos, AS LONG AS YOU ARE VIEWING THEM ON AN APPLE SCREEN, as soon as you display them on anything else, its just another photo from a phone camera- no expandable storage? oh thats right, so they can sell me cloud storage thats so clearly easy to hack...no thanks- lots of other pointless and not intuitive operation methods, like, to edit an alarm, you have to select edit, then the alarm, and to edit another, you gotta go back up and hit edit again....why design this way? zero user fluidity...ALSO, wanna click on the notification to open it? nah, you gotta slide to right to open and left for other operations, or slide it up for a faster go away response, which is the same as swipe left option, so again redundant, non-fluid operation that could easily be designed another way.My first iPhone will be my last. I gave it some time, but this entire setup and function design is really far from intuitive or fluid. I finally truly realize why everyone I know in program engineering or computer science has an Android.I know theyre popular, but like...The united states is literally known in part for its poor education and stupidity...no wonder this country loves this phone!!!	0

Function of the iPhone up to the diagnosis perfectly. So sent in and waited. After careful examination of the Apple technicians a defect of the motherboard was found. Cost of repair 330, - €! That at a time when Apple is no longer allowed to sell Iphone 7 and 8 in Germany and break the sales figures. A rogue who thinks bad things! The theme of Iphone 6s has done for me.

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Jan	4	Solid development	2016-09-20	de	First of all, I would like to refer to various other reviews: If you did not have the device in hand, should save derogatory and unqualified reviews! I have pre-ordered the device at Apple in black and 16.9. received by express. Later this year, I used the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and until recently the iPhone 6s (so no one would think I was biased). The Galaxy S7 Edge is a great device, personally it was a bit too big in the long run Since I use a MacBook as a laptop, which perfectly harmonizes with iOS devices perfectly, and the loss of value of Samsung devices is unfortunately very high, I switched to 6s, with which I would like to compare the new iPhone 7. To structure the whole thing a little , I go to the points Design, Extras, Performance, Price and Conclusion ein.1.DesignDas design of the new iPhones was already known before the Apple Keynote. Externally, compared to the 6s, little has happened. The antenna strips, which ran across the back, are fortunately now past. Furthermore, the camera was a little modified. It does not look much like a foreign object anymore, as the back covers the lens. Apple has also introduced two new colors and one painted. So there are now gold, rose gold, silver, black and diamond black. The color space gray was deleted. Last but not least, the new iPhone differs from the old one, due to the lack of a 3.5mm connector for headphones2. ExtrasThe new iPhone is touted with a whole series of "" great "" extras. For one, it is now, finally, IP67 certified, which means limited waterproof (30 minutes at 1m water depth) It also comes in two new colors and the design has been minimally modified. Furthermore, there is no physical homebutton anymore. The new homebutton is a static surface that is moved by a small motor, the Taptic Engine, to create the feeling of pressing a real button. In theory, that sounds pretty good, in practice it could be better. I personally like the new home button. He recognizes my fingerprint as well as the 6s and I can adjust the strength of the feedback. In addition, the loud click at the 6s annoyed me. The problem is that the button ONLY responds to skin contact, so it can not be pressed with gloves. Is a little problem (just press on / off switch) but not quite thought to the end. Argument for the omission of the real button was, by Apple, the waterproofness. For me that's nonsense, my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge was also waterproof, despite the normal button and headphone jack. The new camera is compared to the 6s, much better! It succeed better pictures in dim light, through the new aperture and videos are just a lot smoother, because they no longer blur due to the image stabilization. Compared to the S7 Edge, the images are relatively equal. Samsung tends to overwork the pictures too much. With the iPhone 7, the colors are more natural. Samsung has the faster Autofokus.Ein another "" Extra "" is the missing 3.5mm jack connection. This was much discussed and written. I personally do not care that much. There will be matching earpods and an adapter for the use of existing headphones included. A few magazines write of poorer audio quality when using the adapter. But if you call a smartphone with compressed music and good audio quality in one sentence, you should not take it very seriously.A nice feature compared to its predecessor are the stereo speakers. To the well-known speaker at the bottom of the device, now joins another, which is located next to the earpiece and shines forward. Sounds a lot better and louder than its predecessor. A positive development: The memory has been enlarged! Thus, the 16s in the smallest version only 16GB were installed, it is now 32GB. Next it goes with 128GB and 256GB.Ansonsten one must admit that in comparison to the predecessor has not noticeably much improved. The display is a bit brighter and shows colors better, it's a new processor on board and that's it.3. PerformanceYes, the new 7 Series breaks all benchmark records! But no one notices this in normal use! It feels as fast as the 6s. Also compared to my Galaxy S7 Edge, I see, except the operating system, no added value. For me the Galaxy is the most beautiful device but unfortunately with the wrong Software.Man can play everything with the 7 and has plenty of power for the future. However, the technical development is so far that the 6s the next two years will not be maxed out ... There are plenty of videos on YouTube, where Samsung devices are compared with Apple iPhones. In terms of gaming performance, Apple's devices are ahead, but logically, Apple has a very limited choice of devices running the iOS operating system. Adapting software for the few devices is therefore relatively easy. For Android, however, a game must be compatible for devices from 50 € - 900 € with a variety of hardware components. There has a device 1GB of memory and another 6GB. Here the adaptation of a game is much harder.4. PriceYes such an iPhone is not the cheapest smartphone. Currently the cheapest way is via the homepage of Apple itself, where the smallest version starts with 32GB at 759 T € uro. However, this is favorable compared to the previous year, as the storage variants have doubled. It should also not be left unmentioned that Samsung has demanded 699 € and the S7 Edge 799 € for the market launch of the S7. Furthermore, Apple products are subject to a much lower price decline than other electronics manufacturers.5 Conclusion: Who is the device for? Anyone who already owns an iPhone 6s with 64GB, can skip the 7er confidently. I bought it because I was able to sell my 6s for $ 600, so I could upgrade "relatively cheaply". From the iPhone 6, you notice a difference! It's a solid progression. But I think that it will not be until next year, since the iPhone is 10 years old, really interesting. Who wants to customize his device, install their own software and maybe spend less money, should make a large bow to Apple! Android offers a huge range of different devices in all price categories. Unfortunately, Samsung is now also a so-called premium brand, which is clearly noticeable in the price. The iPhone 7 is for anyone who likes to play on his device, value on a good support and for people who just want it, where everything without big problems should work. Ideally one uses already other Apple devices, since these harmonize with each other super! Of course this does not mean that you should not use an Android device with a Mac, or an iPhone can not connect to the Windows machine. In the end, it is also a matter of taste, which everyone has to meet. I hope I could make the choice easier for one or the other, I help as far as I can with any questions ...	0

iPhone 7 Plus	256GB	Silver	Chris Radford	5	Why I came back to Apple following the death of the Note 7....	2016-10-27	uk	My relationship with Android lasted for six weeks……. Here’s why I came back to Apple following the death of the Note 7.I was one of the lucky people who got their hands on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on pre-order launch day!! Yes for the first time in almost a decade, I had decided to move away from Apple iPhones and give Android a try.  How did that go for me though?  Well I can honestly say that I really loved many things about the Note 7 and by association, the Android platform.  Then the first recall happened.  I was slightly irritated!! Then the final ‘give it back NOW please’.I looked around at an alternative to the Note 7.  My criteria were……- 5.5” or larger screen- Fast processor and lots of RAM- Better than average battery life- Lots of storage space- Top quality camera- WaterproofThere were a couple of Samsung features that I really loved, but I knew I had to live without them if I wanted a premium device that wasn’t Samsung - wireless charging being the main one.So why the iPhone 7 Plus then?  Looking at my list of requirements, I couldn’t find a single alternative that could offer all of these features that WASN’T the iPhone.  I remember watching the Apple keynote about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with my Note 7 in my hand, almost hoping that it would be a disappointment.  Sadly the only gripe that I could find was the lack of the 3.5mm headphone socket.  I’ve found a solution to that problem which cost around £15 - Mpow Streambot Mini Bluetooth 4.0 A2DP Wireless Receiver Adapter for Audio Streaming System and Car Kits.  So I’ve had the iPhone 7 Plus for about two weeks now and here’s my early review.Form FactorI have to say that I love the feel of the iPhone 7 Plus.  The silver model looks beautiful naked.  It’s slightly slippery in the hand so if you’re not going to use a case, I recommend a good quality skin or you’re going to drop it.  Apple have redesigned the phone to make the antenna bands less visible, and they’ve got it spot on.  The sleep/wake button, slightly redesigned volume buttons and the mute switch are all in the same place, as is the home key, but this is one of the major redesigns for 2016 - the home key is no longer a physical button.  Apple have used their Taptic Engine to trick your finger into believing you’ve pressed a button, and it really does work.  Whether you want to wake up your phone, launch Siri or close an app, the brand new home key let’s you know that it’s received your command with a little buzz.  There’s even a choice of how much feedback you get from the button.  In my opinion, this great new feature also means that there’s one less piece of hardware to fail and it also forms a part of how the phone has become water resistant.DisplayLet’s be honest, Apple don’t seem to lead the field in mobile phone displays right now.  They don’t seem to have increased the pixel density of their displays since the iPhone 4’s launch of the Retina display.  That said, the iPhone 7 Plus offers a much improved ‘wide colour gamut’.  That means a far more real reproduction on your display than previous models.  Comparing this to the Galaxy Note 7 or S7 (the same display), it’s clear to see that Apple have made an improvement here, and you could argue that the human eye can’t distinguish between the quality of displays beyond 400ppi so it really becomes about manufacturer spec-boasting.  As I review my photos, I feel that they are more alive than ever.  Added to this, the 3D Touch feature, which I felt was a bit of a white elephant last year, really comes into its own now.  More and more 3rd party apps have embraced the concept and now you can use force touch to simplify tasks.  No other brand offers this technology right now and it wasn’t until I started using it again, after my six weeks in the Samsung wilderness, that I realised how much I’ve missed it.CameraWhat can I say about the iPhone 7 Plus camera?  One word - WOW.  iOS 10.1 brought with it the fantastic ‘Portrait Mode’ update, promised in the iPhone 7 launch keynote.  This is Apple’s best ever camera and it truly is the best camera I have ever owned.  Not only is it lightning fast to launch - take the phone out of your pocket and raise it to eye level, swipe to the left and bang it’s ready to shoot - but everything about it is improved.  The all-new wide colour gamut on the display gives you a much more reliable preview of your picture before you shoot, focusing is quick and reliable and the new telephoto lens allows for 2x optical zoom which really does make a difference.  It also means that the phone is capable of 10x digital zoom to a much higher quality.  The difference between this camera and the 6S is really noticeable.Portrait mode is a breakthrough.  Some Android phones have tried to mimic this feature, but Apple use a mixture of hardware and software ‘machine learning’ to give an effect that you would only normally find from a DSLR and a talented photographer.  I find it hard to take a photo without trying to use this mode now, and the results I’ve had in just a few days of the update are remarkable.  All in all, the latest iPhone snapper is a stand-out feature.WaterproofingHotly anticipated for the iPhone 7 / 7 Plus was some kind of waterproofing.  Many reviewers believed the 6S to be waterproof but I for one didn’t ever put that to the test.  Apple have achieved this for 2016 by making a few changes - the SIM tray now has a rubber seal, there is no earphone socket letting water in and the home key is software based rather than a hardware ‘button’.  All of those boring details give you a phone that can take a few splashes.  Apple say that you can submerge the phone is 1.5m of water for 30 minutes and have rated it IP67, making it officially water RESISTANT.  They have quite cleverly excluded water damage from the warranty though so please beware if you’re going for a dip.  I feel a lot more confident with my phone in my hand near water or around the washing up bowl, and I am delighted to be able to listen to music in the shower, though I still keep my 7 Plus well away from getting drowned.StorageThe Cupertino posse treated us to an increase in storage space this year.  Whilst there is still (and probably this will never change) no microSD slot, the base iPhone 7 now has 32GB of storage.  I’ve plumped for the 256GB, flagship model.  It means I’m unlikely to ever have a problem when taking lots of photos or video and I can store enough music to last for weeks of listening.  It’s good that Apple have listened to their customers’ need for more storage space, but I really wish they would think about adding removable storage….Battery LifeAnother year, another increase in battery life!!  This year Apple have treated us to quite a bump up in juice.  I’ve been getting a consistent 12 hours of unplugged use with my 7 Plus by virtue of the new 2900 mAr cell compared to 10 hours in last year’s 2750 mAr offering.  I’m somebody who has battery percentage paranoia and I feel totally confident to go about my daily business without an emergency charger in sight.  Compared to my doomed Note 7 with its 3500 mAhr, Apple seem to use their home-grown link between software and hardware to offer an unbelievably good battery life.  Added to that, the recently added ‘low power’ mode can add hours of extra life if you get caught without a charger for a long period of time.ProcessorThe latest A10 Fusion chip gives a multi-core Geekbench score of 5645 compared to the now defunked Note 7’s 5617.  In reality though, the iPhone 7 Plus massively outperforms Samsung’s 7 series phones by a country mile.  This could well be in part due to the deeper integration between software and hardware in Apple’s products, along with generally better quality apps in the Apple App Store.  Games seem to render faster and better and even with the Samsung developer tweaks, the iPhone still outperforms in transitions from home screen to app and vice versa.  The improved in-house designed A10 Fusion processor is further augmented by the additional 1GB RAM present in the iPhone 7 Plus.Earphone SocketI must confess that one of the worst kept secrets of the iPhone 7 was the removal of the 3.5mm earphone socket, and for me this was a problem.  A few weeks in and I have yet to use to bundled ‘lightning EarPods’ or the lightning to 3.5mm jack adapter.  Instead I’ve embraced bluetooth 4 and now use a fantastic device from Mpow which cost around £15 and allows me to plug in any old earphones into a ridiculously small box which receives a bluetooth signal from my iPhone.  The battery lasts around 10 hours with a 1.5 hour charge.  So who needs an earphone socket?  Well as a professional DJ and entertainer, my phone has always been an emergency fall-back device incase my MacBook suddenly fails, but for that to work for me I now need to carry around some kind of lightning adapter AND ensure that my phone has got enough battery as there is no way to charge the phone and play music through the lightning port at the same time.  I’m sure there will be an Apple approved solution to this problem some time soon, and once there is, one will definitely live in my laptop bag!!Virus and Malware Protection and Software UpdatesAs a long - term Apple user, both Mac and iOS, I have become used to the hassle - free nature of the marriage between software and hardware.  The area where this is by far the most apparent is in virus protection.  I can remember the darker days of Windows where the most innocent of email attachments could cause the world to come crashing down and my PC to completely stop working.  It seems that these issues are still very present within the non - iOS community, as I found when WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger both stopped working on my Android handset.  I couldn’t quite believe that this was happening on a 2016, flagship device, but it seems that I have been spoiled with Tim Cook’s gang and their commitment to keeping our devices and data safe.  If none of the features above have convinced you, take a moment to consider a world where you don’t have to worry about viruses.  Comforting though….Apple users are also blessed with regular-as-clockwork software updates.  You can set your watch on Apple’s schedule of releases of their iOS platform, and the statistics are astounding.  As of 27th October 2016, 60% of iPhone users are already running iOS 10, which was only released three weeks ago, compared to only 1% of Android users running version 7 which has been out for quite some time longer.  Even now, only 19% of Android users are running version 6, which was released in 2015!!!  Those are shocking statistics which are also very reassuring for Apple users as every update of iOS includes security patches that keep our devices safe from virus and malware attacks.So these are my thoughts on the iPhone 7 Plus 256GB.  As it turns out, it outperforms Samsung’s flagship 7 series devices is every feature with the exception of the earphone socket.

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	TIDI	2	New device with scratches on the display	2018-11-26	de	There is not much to say. I ordered a new device directly from Amazon. The box was in original packaging. Unfortunately, I then discovered a very visible scratch on the iPhone display. The hope that this is hopefully only on the protective film disappeared after removing it. I'll send the phone back. What's this for? Why are there quality controls if they do not find obvious defects or mistakes on such an expensive product?	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Melanie K.	5	I love my little apple	2016-11-08	de	After 20 years, I switched to the Iphone 6s for the first time from Samsung (after the 1 year old Note 4 was broken). I'm thrilled. From the handling, the design and especially for the reason that the Iphone can be coupled with the Ipad and the Macbook easily. Basically, the combination of all Apple products and the resulting problem-free use is really great! Unfortunately, there are two shortcomings. The switch-off button is now defective after 6 weeks. But was picked up easily by Apple for repair. Went quickly and easily. At the Apple Hotline, I then learned that the device was not actually produced for Germany. Unfortunately, I do not know if this is a disadvantage: The Iphone was delivered in a wrong color. I ordered rose-gold and got it in gold. Was not a big topic for me, because I like both colors but should not be like that.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Patrick	5	Successful upgrade for me coming from the iPhone 6	2016-09-17	de	After almost two years with the iPhone 6, I made the switch to the iPhone 7 on the key date. An overview can be found here in my video. Of course, this can not show all aspects without becoming long. In addition to this, so here are some sentences here: For someone who like me has omitted the 6s Force Touch, so the pressure-sensitive display, and such a home button is a new experience. But for me in any case a good one. In iOS 10, the sensitivity for the Home Button as well as for the display in 3 levels, so that after a short settling time and the difference between tap and hold - for umlauts - and press works. I had some problems with that for the first few hours. The device itself is no different than the iPhone 6. It's 10 grams heavier, but that does not really matter. The display is better and you can read it well in bright sunlight. The speaker has also gotten better and can quack a bit louder. The lack of the jack plug is one thing I have accepted. Apple has always been a company that has cut off old braids and the old analog jack plug belongs m.M.n. also to. And where is the problem? There are plenty of alternatives and headphones with Lightning port for mobile use. The supplied adapter is not a nice solution, because it looks a bit too filigree - replacement costs 10 euros at Apple but I would complain about it but a defect within the warranty period in the store - but it works properly, so that old headphones or amplifiers continue to be used can. Loading and listening is currently not possible. But Belkin has announced a solution and an (expensive) adapter.The aftermarket will certainly soon offer cheaper alternatives. So just leave the church in the village. The included EarPods with Lightning connection work well and the sound is fine, the left is not good for me and I'm always worried, the things are falling out of my ears, so I'm now Lightning InEars of a third party manufacturer ordered. Largest invisible innovation, which I have not mentioned in the video: the iPhone is dust and water protected to IP67 (I = dust class 6, P = water class 7). It may so fall into the water for up to 30 minutes at a maximum of 1m depth without it breaks it. However, this is not part of the guarantee and a wet device must not be charged, it must first be allowed to dry. But that should already say the common sense;) The protruding camera was not quite my thing with the iPhone 6, the even larger and still a little further out standing camera of the iPhone 7 are no exception. And although I was concerned about scratching the glass on iPhone 6 - and even more about iPhone 7 - that did not happen. However, I am also very careful with my things, so whether that is universal I can not say. A protection would help anyway and this is the only real downside of the iPhone. But compensates the camera with good photos on the level of a good compact camera with a fixed focal length of 28mm KB equivalence and 4k video. All in all, I find my upgrade from the iPhone 6 with 128 GB to the iPhone 7 with 128 GB and I'm up the small software bug in iOS 10, which can empty the battery empty, satisfied. But this bug will be fixed quickly, thanks to Apple's good update policy. Everything else works as expected or better. Quality and impression are correct and I am pleased about (m) a new device. The old man has reliably done 2 years of service with me and was therefore absolutely worth his money. It will certainly satisfy the next owner. For my part I recommend every iPhone 6 owner to upgrade to the 7. It is worth from my point of view due to display, speakers, battery power, camera / video and the very fast operation.	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Grey	Vitor Fernandes	4	Great phone but way overpriced	2019-02-20	uk	I got lucky to get this much cheaper than normal price, got a straight swap for my galaxy s9With that said, I would never pay over £500 for this phone, neither the galaxy s9 for that matterI have used almost all iphones since the 3gs, and Ive used a few xperias, and a few galaxiesPROS - Face id is the most unbelievable tech I've ever seen, its magic, it works, I've never had any face recognition on any device working before. The thing is crazy, it works in less than a second, from any angle, from any light condition, with or without my glasses, its actually quicker than the time it gets me to swipe to unlock the phone. To the point I had to double check it it was activated.- Display is nice, I love the true tone, but somehow I think the galaxy s9 display looks a bit better- A huge advantage over the s9, the auto brightness works perfectly, I never ever had to adjust it, it was the same with s9 until the new android 9 which was driving me mad, I had to adjust at least 5x per day.- I love that you don't accidentally press the edges when using- I love that you don't have a pointless bixby button, instead you get a very very useful sound off button- 256gb of internal memory is more than plenty, no need to buy an extra sd card- I like the form factor.DISADVANTAGES- I already miss the notification light- There is no way to remove the screen to the left of the home page- No always on display clock- Sound quality is not as good as S9, specially with quality headphones, which is even worse than my previous s8- No headphone jack, sorry apple but I don't do Bluetooth, I like audio quality- I hate that I cant choose how many rows of apps to have on the home screen, I don't need 6 rows, I don't even have that many apps on my phones- No USB-c, which is more common with many devices including Apples own laptopsAll in all, I'd say the X and the s9 are on the same level, galaxy because of audio, and iPhone because of face id.UPDATE - I just got an Xperia XZ, my 8th phone this year, and will be my last one too, finally I found the perfect phone, has way better audio than the iPhone X, has notification light, has headphone jack, SD card, dedicated 2way camera button, pictures look nicer once you chose 23megapixel in the options,  its more comfortable to hold and has nicer colours/display, has clearer voice call audio too, not to mention it cost 1/10th of the price of an iPhone X. It cost me 80 on ebay.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	Stefan Kretzschmar	1	Steve Jobs would turn in the grave	2016-01-23	de	I changed from the 5s to the 6s, so I'm used to Apple. What strikes me are the small nuances that creep in. This starts with the shorter battery life and continues with the scratching and shaking of the original Apple EarPod plug when I plug the device into my pocket or touch the connector. Sure, I could use my Sennheiser headphones but I do not want that and was not necessary until the 5s because the original accessories reflected a basic quality. Other nuances are the protruding camera, which does not bother me since I use an original Apple leather case. However, it represents a design carver that would have been impossible with jobs. The case shows further changes. The case no longer encloses the whole device but leaves the lower part of the speaker, Lightning and Micro open and unprotected. In addition to the fact that the two lower corners visible not as complex Complete as the old case of 5s leaves it with the overall appearance of a strange taste and makes it appear less high-quality altogether. The only thing that is still accustomed Apple is the price. In conclusion, disappointing for me. The zenith is over. Apart from my remarks, it certainly remains a solid device that its lovers will find. I do not belong anymore and will give it back despite financial loss and hope that my 5s still works.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Vivi	2	Worst interaction with IOS	2017-09-06	de	After almost a year now, I can finally explain myself able to write a reasonable review of the iPhone 7. It will certainly give some text. First: After my initial dislike of Apple years ago, I realized at some point that the products essential cleaner and problem-free than any other device on the market. For years I was very satisfied with my Apple devices. As far as the iPhone is concerned, I've never been so disappointed with an iPhone. I have had so many IPhones among all IOS versions but the iPhone 7 is a real disaster. Not because of some nonsense because of no jack connection, etc. --- People will move with the times and if you do not want it then just do not buy it. One also moves into an expensive apartment that you do not like and then just moans around. --- The problem is not even the hardware but definitely the software. From Apple, I've always been used to holding a product in my hands, which is fully mature. Meanwhile, this is far from the case. I own the iPhone 7 in rose gold with 128GB of memory, which is already an exchange product from Apple - but unfortunately also has the same Fehler.Zu beginning: I never had problems with Finding of mobile network etc. The sound is very nice, the display of the display is clean and pleasant, and the camera works perfectly - all things I can expect for as much money as I think. Now to the mistakes that Over time, I'm getting more and more annoyed and force myself to hard-reset the iphon almost every day. The IPhone had problems with Bluetooth from the start. Sometimes it connects, sometimes not (with different devices mind you). If you're lucky, there is a perfect connection, if not you have crashes every second and may be at the car radio, for example. Look forward to music that sounds only every second second. Both my first (purchased from release), as well as the exchange device makes (t) en this problem. Then: Unexpected snagging so that no action is possible for a minute. Neither display nor buttons react then. Also: Constantly crashing the most diverse apps. Some do not even start anymore. The battery runs incredibly fast even though it is not old and should actually last longer than before (I'm not a cell phone user and have a normal daily use - sometimes a WhatsApp message, sometimes Googling, sometimes on the Watch calendars or weather and occasionally write notes - depending on the day sometimes more and less use but not exaggerated) - Well the battery sometimes does not even hold until the evening and although I volllade.Updates lately also made without as of I'm set to hang on the charger?! Insufficient accuracy and function of the display ... and since the last IOS update constantly problems with the synchronization of emails (and as I said, it is far from my first iPhone, the usual setup errors or connection errors I exclude confidently) I have to get rid of how frustrating that is. I'm glad when I get my iphone 7 finally going on. Wait for the keynote from Apple to the iPhone 8. If I should like it and the budget does not blow up (which I assume, however) I will upgrade. If not, I'll downgrade and get a 6s, 6s or 5s again, which would be much better. Too bad I never thought I'd ever be able to give an Apple product only 2 stars. But there I have to stay objective, that is simply an impertinence I was never used to from Apple. I hope there will be a lot of improvement with the next models.	0
iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Rob	2	Samsung stood 2 years ago	2017-10-03	de	I already had a 5s in front of the iphone 8 and finally an S6 edge. I'm bothered by the Iphone8's low-resolution display in contrast to the S6. Furthermore, the camera can not handle RAW, and you always have to make do with the images calculated by Apple. The S6 is not an issue that makes dng files + jpg. Wireless loading is in most Android devices for years no issue ..... I give a completely overvalued mobile phone back and will be back for the time being my S6.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Sebastian	5	Top Bounty for those who want it	2017-12-11	de	Absolutely solid smartphone with good new technology, as it should be. The problems that some describe here I can not confirm. The new features are well-developed, nothing that has errors somewhere or anything, I'm happy with it. That's better than the old one is probably the prerequisite if I get such a device, because I think I need not think about it, that should be clear to everyone here. On the plus side, of course, it is at a high level where I would think it scares off customers. I myself got it from the employer, but I would refrain from spending over 1000 ¬ spend. There is really more important in life where you spend your money on than for things that are written off after 2 years. I do not want to influence anyone now, that everyone should decide for themselves. I am since the 3er, users of the devices of Apple and are therefore already obsessively bound to have to take each new but which should not be a shortcoming. All in all, but good device, with which you can work properly.	0

Telephony without just playing whatsApp without video.7.) There are no video and photo settings8.) Many apps at android which is free or cheaper, costs money at iphone or twice as expensive ... 9.) Many of my favorite apps at iphone 6s does not exist, eg AndroVid, RealGPS, DroidVPN.Also almost no positive thing, only that it is fast, but functions are worse, I do not know what is so great there?

iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	NS	1	Received scratched	2019-02-19	it	I think it is unacceptable to pay a similar price and find yourself a scratched product even before using a new item. Quality control equal to zero.And the most absurd thing is that it is not the first time that strange / heavy inconveniences happen to me, unfortunately lately the quality level of the products on this e-commerce has dropped by a lot. The choice of certain couriers then it accentuates the deterioration, in fact I gave up and abandoned even my Prime subscription, in addition to buying much less since then you are necessarily obliged to return, finding yourself being called back, unjustly. I hope, for all of us, to be just randomness and not other.	0
iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Marco	1	Apple has served its time	2016-10-24	de	I was actually a happy Apple user. Had always IPhones, MacBooks and IPads. Above all the reliability and stability of the software as well as the optimal software tuning on the hardware let me buy again and again a new Apple product despite the clearly higher price compared to competing products. Also, the compatibility of the profucts was very good. In the meantime, I have bought laptops and smartphones from other manufacturers with the software Windows and Android, due to a significantly better price-performance ratio, but I am always returned to Apple products mainly due to the simple and reliable condition. After I had the iPhone 6s exactly 1 year, started several massive problems at the same time. The iPhone 6s crashes completely for no reason despite the simplest applications. It always switches off at a battery charge of 20 - 40% and goes on (if at all) only briefly for a few seconds again. The software is of course always up to date. Resolutions did not solve any of the problems mentioned. Also, I exclude a misuse and handling of battery or charging. What a coincidence that these problems exactly 1 year after the purchase of the product (840 € im Apple Store) while Apple is still as good as all other electronics manufacturers ONLY 1 year warranty on its products instead of the usual 2-year warranty, as practiced even by the cheapest no-name manufacturers. A rogue who thinks of planned obsolescence? I will not now as planned, the new IPhone 7 grow and buy no other iPhone. There are some alternatives and fortunately I am not "brand fixed" which makes me open to all manufacturers. Recommend everyone to do the same, because as we know: "" Competition gives wings to the market "".	0
iPhone 7	128GB	Black	nichtl	4	Development in order, but this time partly in the wrong direction	2017-01-08	de	So far, I've been through every iPhone generation (as there was always a reason to switch) - so I'm coming from the iPhone 6s right now, and I'm referring to it mostly. About the 6s I wrote and other long reports. The iPhone 7 has somehow hardly triggered a credit-Will-reflex. I bought it only because my mother wanted to change from her 5 and wanted my 6s. When I had the 7 in my hand, I seriously thought about using the 6s - the differences are absolutely marginal. The things that are better on the 7th pick it up, which makes it worse than the iPhone 6s. I do not really need a super development and something new every year. But I do not want to go backwards. Things that are the same or only marginally better for the 6s: - Speed ​​(absolutely seamless and smooth) - Display (still no full black, but quite close to it) - Camera housing quality (still very nice) - Software (no difference) - Battery life is slightly higher. Has with me after 2 days still some remaining time. I also do not check Twitter 10x / hDinge, which makes the iPhone 7 better: - Waterproof (but without guarantee ... well, then only halfhearted anyway) - No more mechanical Homebutton (a gateway less) - Much better speakers (me personally not important, mainly for ringtone) - design a shade better because antenna strip is now at the bend. Things that make the iPhone 7 worse (than the 6s): - GPS is a lot less accurate (annoys me a lot because I have many ways There is no bad reception!) - NO Headphone-Jack: I have to do this shortly in more detail. I am not against dropping the latch and consider it a necessary step. BUT: the only remaining connection is LIGHTNING, which is ONLY to be found on Apple devices, so NOT universal as jack, USB-C. I'm assuming that USB-C will replace the jack, which is good as manufacturer-specific. You'll need an adapter forever if you want to hear music → Absolute regression, almost scandalous. It would have been correct: install USB-C. I do not know why people do not get upset. Conclusion: For the first time I'm not happier with the new generation than with the previous one. But that does not change the fact that the device is an extremely high-quality, reliable piece of technology. The regressions did not have to be. That's why 4 stars.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	TaXi	1	Defective battery! Apple finally offers exchange program	2017-01-07	de	First: I am actually a peaceful-friendly Apple Iphone user since the Iphone 4. Only since the 6s started the trouble. Somehow there is now the worm in it and the whole Apple experience came to a halt, also thanks to lack of Inovation. Right annoying is the battery error: My 6s turns off in a light cold immediately (whether walking, running / jogging, photos at the customer to attempt). I asked the telephone support for clarification months ago and they have actually admitted that there are massive problems (allegedly because of incorrect programming) but my battery would be - according to remote maintenance - in order. Then I was in Centro Oberhausen over Christmas and I'm there in the Apple Store. Behold! There is now an exchange program (found on the apple page and support and then at the bottom "" 6s turns off "" Check here if your phone is affected - Yes of course it was das.Ich could leave the Iphone there and then pick up in 4 days ... erhh yes tips idea.Since I live not in the Centro Oberhausen I have called a Gravis Store in my city. Currently, so many phones are affected (so here can not be the case of individual cases!) that I have to wait three weeks for the new battery, because Apple does not exchange or send out new batteries - NO - first my phone has to be sent in and then there is the new battery - well, what am I doing with my customers in the meantime? Or no matter what, do private individuals who would like to have a cell phone in time? Why Apple offers nothing for (replacement of the cell phone - you should repair it and then resell or take back the scrap and give us a new one). I think it's not ok anyway a cell phone which 800, - EUR now costs to open and reinsert the battery in a service building. This has m.M.n. then nothing more to do with the quality directly from the factory and is still a real Entwertung.Also be careful at 6s - I would not buy it anymore. Make your own picture and google for the battery problem that is very common.	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Hannes	5	The phone itself was great, it had to return nevertheless ....	2017-01-01	de	I do not need to say much about the iPhone 7 ... just great! Nevertheless, I had to return the phone because the version I ordered in Austria did not work. Nothing was mentioned by the provider, especially since the shipping to Austria was also offered. After unpacking the mobile phone, I had the first (negative) Aha moment. There was no EU plug, but the power plug for the US ..... this was not the main problem. IPhone 7 charged (of course, with a "" normal "" plug for Austria), Austrian SIM card inserted, go through the first part of the registration on the iPhone, Game over! SIM card is not recognized. Then tried several Austrian SIM cards, unfortunately no success. Because of this, I had to understand slowly now that this sold and offered version of the iPhone 7 does not work for EUROPE.

iPhone 6S	32GB	Gray	Elisa	1	Not even a month of use, cell. does not start charging any more	2019-04-06	it	Purchased less than a month ago, after I could not recharge the phone due to force majeure, this was obviously off due to low battery. Connected to the cable the following day, battery does not give signs of life, it does not charge, and even with the combined buttons you can start the phone. Update: after a month the phone has not been repaired because I have to disable a function. I am informed that I will be returned and then once I reset I will have to send it back for repair. after a few days they insist on replacing the mobile phone or making me a refund, despite insisting that I have work data inside and I have to recover it. I would like to know where the phone is? Amazon disappointment.	0

I have until now the iPhone 8Plus! What is really great :), but I would rather another .. the newer, the better:) I have now read a lot of "bad" about the iPhone XR & I think, then I'll love the iPhone XS Max, IPhone XS I think that's out of the question, because the processing should not be so good and because it's smaller than my iphone 8Plus. And I love big phones! What would you recommend? Which of the 3's? Please only give some tips that have the respective IPhones :) that would help me the most !!

iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Jens Reitter	5	Have an S7 edge and will exchange it again for the current iPhone7	2016-09-17	de	Actually I was happy with the iPhone 6, but the hardware of the S7 edge appealed to me a lot. Great part and certainly also cheap, if you compare it with the iPhone. But the Android system, the iOS just can not keep up with the water. Especially with the iOS10 this is striking. Away with the complexity, the barely existing stability ... to the intuitiuven, stable, high-performance and great OS. To iPhone7 now a few words, because I could hold it in my hands: Yes, the design has hardly changed. Why should it be different? It's ok if it succeeds. Since you can treat yourself to an extra year and come up with a new design. It lies well in the mobile phone, does not have the optical Schnick-Schnack the edge of the S7 edge. This edge is rather annoying than helpful, because again and again apps are started that you do not want to start. Just write comments, if you had the thing in his hand. When it comes to a star ... that's ok, but then honestly and with arguments. :)	0

iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Amazon-Kunde	5	Not the best, but ...	2019-04-12	de	I would like to ask in advance, yes I am an Apple fan, but not blind or blinded. My transition was made by the iPhone 5s on the XR. The display is supposedly not as good as in other phones, that may be the direct comparison, for example. with the Xs / Xs max does not justify my extra price in my opinion. If one takes a current Samsung S or a Huawei eg. P30, the Xr looks a bit old-fashioned at first sight. But that does not bother me so much that the inner values ​​are really good. Face iD works absolutely fast and reliable. In normal use, the battery is enough for me 2 days. What I like well is the ability to use eSim so you can use for example an O2 and a Vodafone sim. There is even the possibility of the voice line of zb. O2 separate from the Vodafone data line. Direct parallel operation is not possible. The only drawback is the position of the keys, something that probably would not have happened under Steve Jobs. Since the loud and quiet keys are opposite the power button, it happens to me quite often that I unintentionally take a screenshot. Otherwise, I have nothing to complain about, a total of a very good overall package of hard and Software.Kaufempfehlung	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Seba83	3	Evaluation from the point of view of a transferor	2016-09-27	de	Before I start to judge the device, I have to explain myself briefly. I've been an Android user for my entire (smartphone) life and am not out of dissatisfaction, but out of pure curiosity to Apple. And since I am a tech enthusiast I usually do not have too many problems with such a change. I am well aware that there are a lot of fanboys and hunters in both camps. Many still cite the higher stability and performance as an argument for the Iphone. And that was the way it was then. But today it's really snow of yesterday. There is no noticeable difference in performance between an Android flagship and an Iphone. My S6 Edge has not even crashed in a year and a half - and I could not see any of that. So this argument is really a very old hat and only applicable when comparing an Iphone with a low budget Android device. Otherwise - Pustekuchen.Aber we now come to the actual test "Gentlemen, this is a nice device." So or so were my first thoughts when I unpacked the Iphone. Made from one piece and extremely high quality. Also extremely perfect in terms of weight. Just as hard that you feel something valuable in your hand. I opted for the dull black version, which I also rate here today. The only unattractive are the streaks on the back which arise during use, but of course can be wiped away again. Similar to fingerprints.The new homebutton: I only know the old one from friends and family, because I've never had an Iphone myself before, but this thing really worked. Not a real button, but it feels the same way. (One feels an (adjustable) resistance during printing Very well resolved and virtually unbreakable In my eyes a eliminated breaking point Very good! The missing headphone jack: So I'm missing nothing here The adapter works well and the included headphones are not the course Yellow of the egg, but quite usable. The operation: I took about 2-3 days to get used to IOS is indeed logical - as a newcomer or beginner, but then it worked really well.Of course, the Android user lacks a bit of comfort here at one point or another. (see point: Differences to Android) Therefore, the system seems to me in one way or another not quite thought out. But man is known to be a beast of habit and bad IOS is by no means. The Camera: The is perfectly fine and up to date. The pictures are good to very good, although sometimes they tend to blur. Also, colors are more natural or slightly paler. But if I remember correctly too soon a too high saturation of the colors was criticized. Is and remains a matter of taste. The front camera is without a doubt damn good. If not the best of me ever tested on a smartphone. The battery: As I said, I have no comparison to other Iphones - but know that was criticized in previous devices always as a weak point. I do not see that here at the 7th. The battery is not outstanding, but also no point to criticism. Throughout the day you get wonderful with medium use. The screen: crisp, but somehow a bit darker than I'm used to. Even if I turn off the automatic brightness and "full turn up" the background image is still darker than the "original image". I can not explain myself and that bothers me a bit. The experts among you may like me in the comments remedy.The pace: Since I do not play, I understand the point not synonymous tested. The surfing page setup is perfectly okay and pretty fast. As it should be with a top smartphone. Unlocking via Touch ID also works reliably and quickly. Only when quitting apps via the home button, there are occasionally small stuttering in the animation. Does not really bother, but annoys me in the otherwise buttery performance but a little bit.Gravierende differences to Android: (This point is not included in the evaluation, but is certainly interesting for one or the other future Umsteiger) - You can not mark several contacts at once. (to copy or delete) - You can not align the apps on the screen at the bottom of the grid (About the fixed apps) - It will not automatically different photo folders for example. WhatsApp and Facebook created. Everything is stored under photos and you have to sort yourself.- I can not finish all open tasks at once, but have to swipe each one up individually.- There is no "" back "" button. You can find this option somewhere on the page or in the App.- Setting new ringtones is already a small act about Itunes. This is not directly on the phone. The sound (speakers): Absolutely no criticism at this point. Clean stereo sound, the best I've ever heard on a smartphone. Even the ringtones sound really nice. Conclusion: It is and remains a question of faith. Apple has certainly (probably also consciously) left some air here. But it is and remains a top smartphone at a very very high level. But it is certainly the best opportunity so far, even for newcomers to dive into the world of Apple. And if you then decide against it again - the resale value of Iphones is so far undefeated on the smartphone market. I'll stay in this world for a while. I like every now and then changes. But my opinion remains - IOS is different than Android - but not better. ;) Supplement 30.09.2016In the meantime I use the device for a week and I noticed something different from Android. I used to like to turn on Airplane Mode to answer several Whats App messages (so I do not get new messages when writing). I could then simply send them and they were then sent when I have turned off the flight mode again. That was also quite handy if you had no reception - write messages and send went anyway. Whats App has then sent automatically if you had network or Wi-Fi again. That does not work with IOS, here one can not on "" send "" press if one has no receipt. I find a bit annoying to be honest.Supplement 11.10.2016Language quality telephonyMittlerweile I've tested the quality of the phone calls on the heart and kidneys for me personally everything is impeccable and excellent.I can not understand any criticism, maybe that's also more of a personal feeling. ApronsI can now understand much less why the Apple disciples are always screaming that the iphone never crashes. There have been 3 times in the last weeks the situation that the homebutton did not react even though the unlock was displayed. Twice I was able to save myself via the camera in the menu, once I had to turn off the phone completely. Annoying! If this happens more often I will have to adjust the evaluation. Nachtrag 02.12.2016I have now sold my Iphone again and I (actually to bridge the new Android flagship next year) come an Honor 8 fetched. And I am completely thrilled. After I had this device for less than 400 euros in the hand, I was mystified why people seriously spend more money on a phone. But that is not an issue here. Reasons for me to resell the Iphone were the following: - The size. 4.7 inches are really too small for me. 5.5 inches, on the other hand, too big. Yes, I am quite funny about that. And the Iphone 7 Plus is also significantly larger than other representatives with these screen dimensions.- The missing "" back "" button. That's comfort for me. I really missed the Iphone.- The "" unsorted "" photo folder. That really drove me crazy now. All photos from all sources in a folder. And then you can sort yourself. Itunes (without comment;) The Iphone is really not a bad phone. And who knows nothing else will probably love it too. But it has nothing more mystical and of course has its lags and crashes. Even more than my former S6. It remains a smart and functional smartphone that is well worth its money. For me it makes a much cheaper phone much happier. For price / performance, I then pull off a star again at the end. Thus, we end up with three stars, even with a half in mind;)	0

Reason: I ordered it in silver, like all its predecessors. Silver is only the border, the back is white. If you know it, scroll through the close-ups and look closely, you can see it on the Apple website too. If you do not know it, the back looks silver. The same applies to the color gold. Only the black version probably has a film under the glass back and is therefore black. Maybe you should know that before ordering. Unfortunately, the note is missing from Apple or I have not found it.	0

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Alex	5	Mobile super, Amazon packaging pathetic.	2019-01-20	de	After I switched to iOS with the 5s 6 years ago and I also tried out current Android devices, I wanted to get an iPhone again despite the prices. Although I could afford it, I do not see 4-digit amounts for a cell phone and am also completely satisfied with the XR. The display, which is often seen as the biggest drawback, despite the resolution is absolutely satisfactory for a LCD. The rest, there are enough tests and after I had the Xr in my hand, I would not know why I would have 300+ euros for an Xs I would buy it anytime again. But what I have to get rid of is the way it was sent from Amazon. The phone was thrown into a box and sent. No packaging material - nothing. Absolutely unacceptable to send a product for 800 euros and save on any type of upholstery for 10 cents. The box was already slightly dented on the outside and if the iPhone packaging even the slightest bruise by shipping could be seen, I would have sent it back. Shipping as always fast, but that was the last cell phone that I bought at Amazon .Da because it is the product, I do not deduct a star, but only for the display resolution (even if the best LCD) and of a good price-performance ratio, you can not speak, but who buys an iPhone , knows that before.	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	C. Lampe	1	Face recognition is an impertinence	2018-09-06	de	First off: Of course, the iPhone X is as good as all the iPhone's before him plus various improvements. The missing button is sometimes really missing, but one has got used to the operation by means of finger gestures quite quickly. Why then 1 star? Because the face (not) recognition drives you to madness. It is already stupid enough that you can not unlock the phone - like the one with finger-touch - directly at the elevation. But that would be bearable, if the facial recognition would work at least at the frontal superiority to 95% plus x. In fact, the rate is below 50%, the immediate detection (as in advertising) even at most 20%. If one can believe the traditions, Steve Jobs would have run in the face of such a worsened product probably in the headquater Amok, so it must be enough that he probably turns permanently in the grave. In any case, I have never owned an Apple product that I had to annoy every hour - to the iPhone X. Apple: Put, 6.	0

Super part of this part can tell me when I have to move, can me with one or the other hardware from Apple my pulse Announcements, can pay with it & in two years it will probably breathe and revive people. It puts every value on other things, but that Apple sells smartphones for this price, which does not even trivialities (transfer pictures, download one or the other) without the 30 tutorials and 12 apps must load is worthless in my opinion! I am disappointed that this mega-group is going to lift such a hype for something that is not worth a penny more than any other mobile phone! Nice that this thing can play so much future music, but fails with the simplest things! Hopefully some will understand and continue to pump so much money into this brand before not even trying anything else, which is a lot better for less money ...	0

Even that continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a decade of Apple’s steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same design for a third straight year plays against expectations.Inside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to two hours.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Lars Wisotzky	2	Phone is okay, iOS for me an absurdity	2018-08-19	de	My first IPhone, provided by the company. With, it was clear that it would be a change. But I did not expect that much regression. After 4 months, my impression does not improve. Especially since the operating system is inflexible, inconsistent and not very user friendly. And that's what most Apple users did. The keyboard of Apple zb. Is inaccurate, makes less clever correction suggestions, special characters only with switch. This can be done better. Siri, well. Acts somehow like beginnings of assistance. Back Button is on the top left, often swipes (but not always) and other apps is built back down somewhere. Experience with Amazon Music: Music download in the app is blocked by Apple. Well, congratulations. Furthermore, I notice that inapp purchases are often more expensive than Android. Myibidder costs nothing on Android per bid, with Apple 50 cents !!! To the phone: basically the hardware succeeded. Display good, camera very good (the shots with weak light are bad). Face recognition good, annoying in the car holder. Banking release with face recognition great. Battery okay to very good. Sometimes empty, sometimes it lasts forever. Wireless charging works great and is convenient. My conclusion: who uses and likes assistance systems is wrong here. There are many restrictions associated with the phone. If you like the Apple world is certainly well served with the hardware.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Scott Taylor	4	Great phone but not worth the money	2018-04-20	uk	I have had the iPhone X now for about 6 months and despite loving it, I regret buying it! Simply because of the cost.Whilst the phone feels great in the handle, offering a premium feel but in a palm friendly size the innovation from the iPhone 8 doesn’t justify the price. Sure you have Animoji, which I’ve used about 5 times but all in the first few days to show my kids. The only real innovation I feel is with the display and the face unlock. The display is good! Is it the best? No.. there are better out there but it is a big improvement of previous iPhones. Face unlock I do think is great, works everytime and I like the fact it works with pretty much all apps that would need fingerprint id. Apple Pay is a bit fiddly sometimes but most part ok. Apart from this it is just the same as any other iPhone!As for build quality... it’s great... BUT!! Definitely recommend a case as the frame of the phone scratches just by looking at itSave your money and get the 8 which is what I wish I’d done	0

iPhone XR	64GB	White	Florian	5	First skeptical - now completely excited!	2019-02-21	de	iPhone XR / white / 64GBWhat's too big - yes, something sound - fantastic! Touch - unique! Phone calls - outstanding! Seriously, when the thing came I wanted to exchange it again and ordered directly the 8'er because it is simple and simple was too big, but after two days Ümgang so I'm just excited about the XR. And yes, 192g is not a lightweight compared to the 5SE used before. Nevertheless, after a few phone calls, the decision was firm - the XR is here and stays here. The display is brilliant and the sound of the speakers is a real poem for the ears. The battery keeps feeling eternal despite continuous use (mail, music, Internet, phone and so). In addition, the animated Emoje classes and one more, the thing is just sow fast! The slide functions perfect and the home button I miss now no longer, on the contrary, it almost bothers the other. With missing the CR and 3D touch I've never missed, the feel of touch is enough for me completely. Clear recommendation!	0

iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Kenny Maciver	1	Two replacement iPhone X's in 2 weeks ; Big Unresponsive screen Issue	2019-01-21	uk	I got an iPhone x at Xmas but began using it two weeks ago. On the second morning 15 mins after taking it off the overnight charge, the phone froze with the little spinning wheel in the middle of the screen. It rebooted itself, a process that took 10 minutes. It did the same on the second, third and fourth day, then on the fifth it did not reboot and the screen was totally unresponsive. Calls would still come in and the phone would buzz but not ring but could not be answered. Took it back to Vodafone and they replaced it.The same thing happened with the replacement and Vodafone admitted that they were experiencing similar problems all over the place. In fact the call centre lady said they must have received a bad batch and she herself had just decided to go for an alternative to the iPhone X. I happened to be in London on Saturday and took my dud phone to the Apple store in Covent Garden. Technician ran diagnostics which showed a power failure and he admitted that they were having serious issues. he kindly replaced the phone there and then.It is now Monday and horror of horrors the little spinning wheel showed up this morning, with the phone rebooting itself. I guess it will happen again tomorrow and on Thursday/Friday it will be dead again, just like the other two.The brand is getting damaged. Very expensive phone to buy that has a major screen issue. Can still use it for accessing the internet on my iPad!! The good thing is that it gets replaced with no issues and I could now write the manual on how to transfer data across from my old phone. Come on Apple we deserve a better product for this price.	0

Already the next day it was picked up by DHL and brought to repair, so far as well - two days later came the news that the Iphone was bent (with a photo) and I have to pay 321 € for the repair. A deformation is not really visible on the photo and certainly not the reason for the error, which is why I have asked the support for a recall and made my objections. The employee told me that Apple always repairs ALL errors of a device and one (which? ?) Deformation is accidental damage, which is why the warranty is not given. No matter for what reason the repair order was issued!	0

Apple support that nothing can be done to remove them from the phone without the password for those accounts - clearly that is never going to happen.  So I am now going to have to take this gift back and send it back to Amazon.  Hardly Christmas.  Completely unacceptable.	0

iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	Marcel	1	Usury prizes for what Apple now gets the receipt	2018-12-03	de	It is a joke what Apple now calls for the iPhone! Not without reason, the sales go back significantly and I agree with the full! One think: There used to be the iPhone 8 and 8Plus for about 700 and 800 euros then came the X where many thought wooow a completely new premium iPhone for an extremely high premium price .... I bought it and must also say that I am completely disappointed with the processing ... I am an iPhone user of quasi first hour but that with a 1150 euro expensive smartphone on the back one side is sharp-edged than the other side (if one of the glass on the frame touches noticeable) is a NO GO! And now it is so the Apple again brings a Preiskracher and that XR the "cheap version" for the price that used to cost the premium model and for the normal model XS offers for over 1100 euros and the hammer! The big one for about 1200! Earlier IPhone 8 = 700 Euro model comparison XS = 1150 Euro8Plus = 800eueo XSMAX = 1200 Euro. As Apple has now finally overstepped the arc and this revenges itself now also on the basis of the new sales figures and that is completely deserved! Price so outrageously expensive then this will be my last iPhone sein.Und I have already heard of many people ... All the best with your usury strategy which slowly no longer rises what by the way applies to other Apple products. The competition is now at least equivalent and much much cheaper. Until then and goodbye Apple!	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	HerrHeerHerr	2	Hach, the good iPhone X;)	2017-11-12	de	Who did not look forward to Apple's new innovation? When I heard about the iPhone X, I stole the order of my iPhone 9S and flew extra to the United States to be one of the first to buy and hold such a gem. I also only had 8 days to go to the Apple Store campen.Zwar I lost my job as Minister of Defense but that was worth it in the end. Because one of the new, innovative features, such as the FaceID, with which Apple has enriched the entire future, was for me the main reason for buying the iPhone X. I'm too lazy to just unlock my phone with my finger. Although you do the phone with your fingers but the sole unlocking me completely aus.Vllt Apple is so innovative and soon developed a new iPhone, which you can control completely only with the eyes, better by telekinesis or thoughts. Would be useful for People who have no hands. Another factor would be the well-known and innovative-bristling OLED display, which is literally soo "cool" that it is sensitive to cold. In order to test this I am even together with NASA and SpaceX traveled to the distant dwarf planet Pluto, where the temperatures are below -600C.- It came out that our spaceship and all supplies froze, the iPhone X, however, ran FAST perfectly. So it was already stable, but it would have at -5 more What to consider as a counterpoint, would be Apple's pricing policy: The phone is me (unemployed) that way too cheap.Denn alone this cool and äuße most useful animation, if you push the widget aside, is in my eyes a fortune of at least € 9999 worth. Stunning thing!	0
iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Yando_SB	4	Detailed review of the innovations	2016-11-18	de	I work a lot with smartphones from any manufacturer, so I know what I'm talking about and I would like to offer all interested parties the best possible assistance with this review. Since not too much has changed in comparison to the previous model, I would like to respond to these changes exactly The first dual camera in an iPhone, and they take beautiful pictures! The depth of field effect is a great innovation that is (unfortunately) only available for the plus model. I'm just wondering why? It is created on the software side, that would create any current iPhone. The front camera only resolves higher and is now also suitable for really useful self-portraits shoot. Definitely timely. Homebutton: unlike the predecessor models, you no longer press a physical button. The pressure of a fingerprint is simulated by the pressure of a Force Touch surface accompanied by a vibration of the new Taptic engine. What that brings? Buttons wear out, the new surface does not wear! However, she ALWAYS needs main contact! No touch pen, no smartphone phone shoes, a living finger! Negative I just noticed the use in my car mount, because you have to push harder than a normal button and I have often shifted the bracket. Taptic Engine: Really great innovation. That a slight vibration feedback in the lower part of the phone can feel so cool, I never thought so far, because the vibration not only simulates the push of a button, it gives, for example, feedback if you on the classic selection rollers (eg birthday / TT / MM / YYYY) Scrolls. Again, the device vibrates easily between the choices, as with a mechanical Rad.Dual Speaker / Speaker: Blades in any case better than any other iPhone. The sound is clearer and much louder than before, and now finally in stereo, which has me as Youtube lovers with the most pleased.Even if the upper speaker (in the earpiece) is a whole corner quieter, convinced the entire Klangbild.Vegfall the headphone jack: It can be argued about. 2 Disadvantages It comes to music over standard headphones only via the free adapter supplied and no way to listen to music loading (without additional accessories). Grade Plus model has such a strong battery that I still had 10% battery after 30 hours without charging plug, with much benefit, energy-saving mode from 20%. Then you prepare yourself, and hand on heart, how often does the situation actually occur? Everyone has to decide for themselves. The new colors: I am cautious about black iPhones. The black machine of my colleague showed after two weeks of very careful use of the first scratches on the back, even Apple itself admits the sensitivity and takes no responsibility for blemishes. Attention! Whether the matte black will look as beautiful as on the first day will remain to be seen, the black powder coating of the iPhone 5 rubbed off after some time, whether with or without Schutzhülle.Preis: I think my buys with an iPhone not only the device As such, but also the perfection of software / hardware tuning, at least 4 years the Latest iOS Updated and a processing of their peers is looking for. Why are there no virus scanners in the store on iOS? Because you do not need one! There is no safer mobile operating system, point. 900 € are perhaps a little high for the smallest version of the Plus models, but I do not rate the price here but the product. Conclusion: The innovations are definitely a step in the right direction, even the omission of the headphone jack. We are moving into a wireless future. If you can do without the above mentioned innovations and who the price is still too high, you can use the predecessor model, which is now also available with 32GB memory and is a good 150 € cheaper.	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Mika	3	Very expensive pile of electronics.	2017-01-24	de	I can honestly not understand this Apple hype. I've also dared after 3 years Blackberry with OS10 to get me such a Eierphone because I did not want an android and there is nothing else that I like it. It's amazing what Starting with a Bluetooth device to send photos to a photo printer, does not work! Send files at all via Bluetooth, is not! Mp3 just as a ringtone, does not work! Create folder , do not work! Device s.Calculator stuck, copy files back and forth, does not work! What's useful in the 7 plus is the camera, the battery, the display and the support, but that's it already. And it comes to me no one with IOS would be safe, sure is not even a smartphone. But that's just my personal opinion of course, everyone sees it differently. Shame the Blackberry has gone over to Android and looks like OS10 can fall asleep!	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Massimo e Katia	5	"Almost perfect	2018-10-17	it	Let's take a quick look at the main strengths and weaknesses of this phone, the latest from Apple, without paying too much attention to cold numbers but, above all, to everyday use. Let's start with what I didn't like: - Weight. Yeah, the history of the rear glass to allow wireless charging has increased the bulk and you can hear it in your pocket, even in your hand it doesn't go unnoticed, but you get used to it.-The camera has a protruding traffic light. Bruttina to see makes the dancer device if placed flat on the back.-The "Notch 1". Staying on the cleat is invasive, especially if you watch videos or if the apps are not optimized, then off that portion of the display and many greetings to the big screen. - The "Notch 2". And here we go again! The diabolical black stripe that still combines us? Reduces the space for system icons in the upper part .... do you want to see the battery percentage, if the bt is on, if a vpn is active, the operator name, etc.? Well, every once in a while you will have to pull down the drop-down menu, the one for the "quick" settings to understand. She looks stupid, but in everyday use it's a nice break! Bad! -The remaining battery percentage. I know, I repeat, excuse me! But what the hell did it take to insert it inside the special icon? Bah! - The battery. Ok, who has had an iPhone is used to it, with intense use you don't get there in the evening, you know. But the story that on the new Iphone lasts the most is stupid. The screen oled sucks, even if there was a difference you wouldn't even notice ...- Siri. Nothing ... despite the shortcuts we are still light years away from the Google assistant. - Le animoji and the memoji. Now, with all due respect ... but what really? Or are you a 6 year old child or what would be the utility? Make you pass for a fool even during messages and video calls? What then at least save us the presentations of the river of ste ca ... stupid! -The processor. An exaggerated power even for a PC. But what are you doing with cell phones ??? If you don't plan to design Dubai's next mall or walk around like zombies for VR games, all power is absolutely useless. Marketing, point. The average user of the "very good" on Facebook and the photo of the cutlet on Instagram what should you do with it?.If you hear a crack and you hope it is the knee rather than the phone, obviously, there is a problem! -It is not 5g. Here too ... Apple we know ... of course they could have been wasted for once. Instead, guess what? No predisposition for the 5g that should arrive in 2020 in Italy. And in two years if you want to use the new band, ooops, it's up to upgrade to the new model. - The physical keys. Now the power button calls up Siri, to turn off the phone you have to simultaneously press the minus volume key and the power key, for the screenshots plus volume key and power key. Uncomfortable. - No lightning adapter / headphone jack in the package. If you want it, you pay for it separately, as does the quick charger. Tirchioni! -Do not justify the upgrade from X, few novelties and not unavoidableWhat I liked: -The processor. I know, I contradict myself, but hell! It's a splinter! Fluid, never a lag, never an uncertainty, never a delay. Smooth! -The display. The oled is a show, in any light condition it is a show. -The sound is actually improved.-The Face-Id is infallible and very fast, even with sunglasses zero problems. He even recognizes me as soon as I wake up, ok then he turns to the other side disgusted, but the phone unlocks him anyway. - The camera. Even if you are not a professional, in any lighting conditions you will always get impeccable results. - Cell phone reception, data, bt and wifi. Perfect, nothing to say.-Build quality. It is an iPhone and you can hear it! - Hardware / software integration always on top. - It is a reliable and simple travel companion in its daily use, you will never have to make too many slamming to keep it in perfect shape. - The Apple ecosystem, closed but at the same time so reassuring, and continuous updates.-The quality of the App.-It may seem silly but ... everything works fine! Certainly there are some defects, I have listed them above, but believe me, once you have this little concentration of technology in your hand, they will be overshadowed. If there are economic possibilities and you are not fond of push customization this is a phone exceptional.If you want to ask a few questions use also the appropriate function of Amazon, I will be happy to help you.	0

iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Argent 	Indrik	4	A classic design proven for a smartphone faster and more powerful than its elders.	2017-11-30	fr	True to Apple, for several years, after seeing how much reception sensitivity was much better than at Samsung. Residing in an area always limited to Edge and FPRS, it is a priority factor. After studying at length the promises iPhone X, with its OLED screen, I decided to opt for the iPhone 8 Plus to succeed an iPhone 6 Plus. Why? - It was obvious that the iPhone X would be much more fragile, considering its design ... What has not missed.- Both being equipped with the chip A11, and the wireless charging.- The unacceptable price difference, OLED technology or not. In this regard, let's not forget that the latter is from Samsung In the end, no regrets with this smartphone boosted by the chip A11, whose graphic quality and the camera are nonetheless improved, and which allows (finally!) The wireless charging.At your disposal for any question, go through the "Comment on this comment", I will answer with pleasure.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Silvija	5	Yes. Everything OK	2017-06-27	de	Although I already ordered a lot about Amazon but here I am very unsure if I should actually make the order over the Internet. Fear was whether the goods actually arrives, in what condition and whether it is an original. Have even opened packaging under the eyes of the postman to have a witness if carton should be empty or similar fears should prove true.So end good all good.Handy came on time. Device corresponds to the original which was bought in Austria. (Have both placed next to each other and one: one compared. Color, size, thickness, functions = ident Menu navigation worked immediately in German Handy is impeccable and works even after a month in the operation excellent Am of course curious if it stays that way or how Apple or dealer in case of a defect would react.For the packaging is not much to say was sufficient.Phone is unlocked.It was impeccably recognized by two different providers simcards immediately.Various apps are supported.Web Internet and mail forwarding work.The setting went virtually by itself .Preissparnis still pretty high. Especially if you should consider with a sim card with a cheap provider and the savings there.With an often overpriced tariff, the phone is indeed paid twice and that even with years of binding.Can say with relief: So actually buying recommended.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Claudi_ts	5	Something that takes a long time..	2018-10-15	de	At first I had no idea which rating I should write here .. but again from the beginning .. In September I ordered my IPhone 8, 64GB in gold, after I read all the great reviews. Also important were the delivery times. Everything was shipped with UPS. Initial difficulties on the part of UPS, I still took in the hope to soon hold my IPhone in the hands. UPS let celebrate and on a Monday my package should be delivered. Since I was not home, the re-delivery should be one day later. I immediately called the toll-free hotline and wanted to make an appointment. 2 pm I'm still working. UPS informed me that there is a kiosk nearby where I could pick up my package. Great, I thought and am on the following day immediately after work: closed. The kiosk was open all week even though the opening times said something different. Through the windows I could see my package lying on the ground .. the iPhone so close and yet so far, I called again against charges at UPS. These could not help with. Finally, I was able to establish contact with Amazon and the dealer Eutronics_Germania. Through many phone calls and a really hard-working boss I did not feel left alone. Nevertheless, in the end, I had to go to the police to file an embezzlement complaint so I could get a new IPhone. UPS informed me meanwhile that I should pick up the package in the shop. Hours: closed all day. Such Witzbolde.Am end, everything went well: via DHL, my IPhone arrived within a short time and I could test it now for a week. Overall, I think it's very good. The quality of Apple is great and the service is impeccable. And since I already had an old IPhone SE, the synchronization worked without problems and I was able to telephone, write and research in the usual way. Overall I am very satisfied with the iPhone so far and the customer service of Eutronics_Germania is top. For UPS I would like to give a different rating. That would be beyond the scope here.	0

It may indeed be that the devices for the different EU countries do not differ technically, but no one guarantees me that on the device not pre-installed Vodafone software or apps that you either do not want or may not get off the device.

iPhone XS Max	64GB	Silver	Ohrwurm	1	Too heavy - too bulky - not modern	2019-01-26	us	I had an iPhone 6 Plus. Which was the big one. So I got the iPhone XS MAX on purpose. I wanted the big one (because I use it a lot for mobile film making & photography). I expected to be extremely happy with my new phone. The camera(s) are supposed to be very good. Now the report: The camera(s) are indeed great. BUT: The microphones on this model are abysmal. Very bad. It is a real issue, frequently discussed in on-line forums. Only I did not learn about it until after the purchase. Voices sounds muffled and unnatural, both receiving and accepting calls. But not all the time. The second severe downside is the weight of the iPhone XS MAX. It is 1.2 oz heavier than the old Plus 6. A BIG minus, though it seems small. It is also thicker. Very clunky and unhandy. It feels truly old-fashioned in one's hands. Not sleek. There is no joy in actually handling this baby. A very, very misguided and unattractive design for end-users.  I am returning the iPhone XS MAX. No wonder, Apple had to lower the price for the XS series in China. They have much more modern phones there. PS.: I am an Apple fan. I have all devices Apple. But this is a serious dud.	0
iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	demeister	5	If you want the latest technology, here is well served despite the high price	2017-11-22	de	First of all: This review concerns the device in general, it describes my alltag experience in the last days. I have been using the device for 10 days, a display error or other problems that have been read in the press, I happily did not occur. Closing several app should be optimized in my opinion. Unlocking via Face-ID worked better and better, had first problem with unlocking while wearing glasses. Apple had been right here, the device gradually learns to know its user, so the face ID function smoothly after 3-4 days, even in very poor lighting conditions. Only the battery charging time bothers me a little. My previous Iphone 6s (battery about 1700mAh was fully charged after about 2h, the Iphone X (battery about 2700mAh) needed about 3.5h so soon twice as long Apple would have been able to place a quick charger at this price instead of a standard charger. All the negative reviews regarding wealth and the very high price in my opinion have nothing to look for. Clearly, the price of this device is very high, but should also the innovations of the device and One should also keep in mind the Preisstabiltät the Iphones in comparison to other providers. Therefore, I can say with absolute certainty that this device currently under no circumstances reviews under 3 stars has earned. How the device next months, years interspersed will show up.	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Kyoshi	4	Smartphone: the choice to make ... iOS or Android	2016-12-16	fr	Smartphone level, clearly a choice is necessary in my opinion: iOS or Android? If the choice is for iOS, well, it's not complicated, it will be Apple.For Android, the choice is very varied. , the phone itself ... It's expensive! Very expensive even.Pay this price for a smartphone ... Mmmhhh ... It hurts! But ... It must be said that the quality is there.And a smartphone is certainly the most used object in the year .It's all the time on either, it is used to go on the Internet, take his mails, play, stay connected to social networks, etc ... Apple improves every year its phones.Iphone 7 does not derogate to this rule: - Sealing (there are still limitations ... 1m deep for 30 minutes) - HP stereo - Best solution for the model no "" More "" - Faster, better camera (as every time) - Better autonomy.The quality of the headphones is very significant (since the iPhone 5 for that matter) .By cons, something that for me makes him lose a star: there is more jack I have invested in a Sennheiser Momentum headphones for its quality ... In wired version because I do not want to have to recharge a headphone (if it is necessary fun to charge, smartphone, headset, smartwatch ... wow!) I can very well use modules to turn my wired headset bluetooth but good ... Or even better, use the Apple Jack adapter <=> lightning. But still an adapter ... In short, it's a personal feeling ... I am disappointed that they removed the jack.Sinon, what to say? It is super responsive that I have always been used to iPhone (or almost ... When the phone is 4 years ... it can rowing ... at last, until the beginning of the month, I had a iPhone 5S and it was always responsive! Unlike the iPhone 4 which is still dragging in a drawer) .I also raises the question of capacity.Finally! The 16GB does not exist anymore! It's time ... It's soon in 2017. However, if you have a good music library, the 32 GB can fill up quickly.With 64 GB, for most people are more than good ... And with 128 GB, there is a margin! It all depends on the amount of music you already have, what you want to do (video? a variety of games?). It depends on your needs and not what the neighbor has.For my part, we chose an iPhone (and more specifically iOS) when: - we want to be quiet with a stable system - we want a smartphone turnkey without having to look to the right and to the left this or that application - one wants to be able to keep a system up to date (with Apple, when a new version of iOS leaves ... The update is available on all the versions of iPhone at the same time ... except for the models of 5 years ago) - we do not necessarily want to hack his phone (easier on Android ) .I have an iPhone since the first version.This works ... Never had any particular problem (small bugs exist but it remains rare and does not last) .Good, the only thing that can be boring is that we do not really feel like changing the phone from one iPhone to the other. There are obviously several system improvements, etc ... A better responsiveness and everything ... But the system itself stay the same.On can be try to go elsewhere ... But we are not necessarily conquered elsewhere ...	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Jan K.	4	From grade 2 to 6s - field report after 6 months	2016-05-04	de	First of all to anyone who reads this. I am neither IOS nor Android fanboy. I just write here my personal impressions on the iPhone. I do not mention technical details at all. Whether a smartphone now has 1,000 or 1,000,000 points in any benchmark does not itch me. The main thing is that it runs smoothly and stable! My conclusion is at the bottom! I really only go into things that have attracted me either very positive or negative. Whether this and that cell phone is now nicer, thinner or faster itches me not. My reason for buying was neither the iPhone as "" status symbol "" nor the possibly high resale value. My grade 2 had served me almost 3 years very faithful service, but then I wanted to have something "" new "". And why not even an iPhone, if everyone is raving about it ._- Pros -_- Battery life: Often criticized. I, however, come with the battery easily a whole day. From 5 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock in the evening the iPhone only runs on the battery. In the evening I still have about 20% - 30%. I'm not a permanent user. Whatsapp, Facebook, emails, music and Youtube are distributed throughout the day. For comparison, with my grade 2 I managed 1 1/2 days. Speed: The iPhone 6s is really damn fast. Apps open in felt milliseconds and you can work immediately. I did not have to wait for a single app until I got started. -Haptic: The 6s is just the right size. 4.7-inch screen diagonal are enough for me completely. At Note 2 the size disturbed me from time to time ... especially with a flip case made of leather you had the feeling to have a tablet in your hand. Operation General: The 6s is my first iPhone ever, so had I get used to IOS on the first day. However, one gets along very quickly, which I noticed positively.-Loud / silent switch: For me, really a feature that I do not want to do without. Instead of setting the phone silent in any menu, it is sufficient to push the switch up or down. For one or the other sounds banal now, because it is not really something special, but since I use it so often, I'm glad for not having to turn on the screen every time.Camera: That really impressed me. My Note 2 was already taking some good pictures, but the 6s gets it out again. I am very convinced of the speed and the quality. A cool feature is the flashing display in a "selfie" in bad light. -Lock screen: Here, incoming messages can be answered directly with a swipe to the left, without having to unlock the iPhone. Incoming e-mails are also displayed here with a short text. Control Center: A swipe from the bottom of the screen draws up a menu in which, among other things, the volume of the app can be changed. It is also possible to switch on / off the W-LAN, flashlight etc. here. Very useful for small hands if you have problems getting to the top of the screen. Sound via AUX: Personally, I would rate the sound quality of the iPhone higher than that of Note 2. Heights are clearer and the basses are also very well balanced. I had always set the Equalizer R & B on both my Note 2 and 6s now. Siri: I admit, except in the car, I barely use Siri. However, I've never had problems with the language assistant so far, and especially in the car, Siri is very useful to me. For skipping a song or calling a friend, I do not have to pick up the phone. This comes very close to the points account. Display: The size of the display is optimal for me. The brightness and the representation of white areas are really much better compared to the rating 2. Colors come across just as well. - 3D Touch: Like Siri, I only use 3D Touch in everyday life for one purpose. If you press a little harder on the keyboard, you can move the cursor while writing in the text. I use this feature very often, as it's much easier and faster than typing around in the written text with my thumb. - One-handed mode: I use it a lot. Although I do not have the tiniest hands, I can not get to the top of the screen without taking my little finger under the phone. By tapping the Touch ID sensor twice, the image reduces to about half and you get into apps, for example. No problem with the top bar. NIGHT SHIFT: A really good option. I've set Night Shift automatically for me from 2200 clock. The image becomes warmer as the eyes relax noticeably and you will not be so much blinded by the screen when it's dark. Contrast -_- Delayed Display: May be the only iPhone 6s owner I own Problem has. However, it now often happened to me that the display remained dark when pressing the Home button and / or the lock button.After several repetitions, it went on. I first thought I had turned off the iPhone, but this was not the case. - Touch ID: Despite clean and fat-free fingers, the Touch ID sensor sometimes does not recognize my fingerprint. Why is that I do not know until today. Often it goes in immediately, then again not. - WhatsApp pictures: Yes, this problem is known. One can create under IOS no "WhatsApp folder" as with Samsung, in which then automatically the received pictures are secured. Everything is saved in the "Recordings" folder. For me, this is one of the biggest annoyances on the iPhone. And the pictures of "shots" in a "WhatsApp folder" to push me in the long run but then too stupid. The same problem is synonymous with iCloud. I put on the PC in the cloud a folder with the name "Computer" and drag pictures into this folder, these are not only shown in "Computer", but also in recordings. I do not understand why you can not turn that off. - WhatsApp "Connect": Maybe hardcore iPhone owners do not understand it, but here's the problem. If you want to write a message in case of poor or missing reception, you have to wait until WhatsApp has connected. Before you can not enter or send a message. On Android it is possible to write and send messages even if you are offline. This will be sent automatically if a connection exists. I do not understand why I'm allowed to wait on the iPhone every time WhatsApp connects. That really upset me and annoy me in the long run just yet. - iTunes compulsion: Maybe some iPhone fans now write under this review "Why are you upset, you knew that from the beginning". Yes you are right. I knew I was tied to iTunes with an iPhone. Nevertheless, I do not think it's nice. iTunes offers me personally no greater benefit. A simple option, like sorting files with specially created folders on Android, would have been more than enough for me. But you can not have everything. - Reverse exchange of music: I have not yet managed to pull music from my iPhone to my PC. The meaning of this "blockade" does not open to me. There are probably programs that can do that with detours, but that can not be the solution .- (Safari sometimes very slowly): I think about this problem, because no one is forced to use Safari. Safari was often very slow for me over any Wi-Fi network. I then have the DNS server on Google's 8.8.8.8 changed. Now it works better. No widgets: Widgets are not always useful, but I miss the weather widget already very much. Just look how the weather is, without having to open an app, I'm already missing. Songs can not be used as a ringtone: Another thing I do not understand. I can not set songs from my library as a ringtone. It should indeed, as in the exchange of music, be feasible via detours, but even here I do not understand the meaning behind .- "Back Button": That was clear to me from the beginning. In an app, I come back to IOS only if I tap the graphic "Back Button" on the top left. I miss Samsung's "back button" bottom right anyway. Video playback: I had synonymous more often the problem that YouTube videos, no matter what W-LAN, at 720P / 60FPS partly jerky. Maybe a YouTube update fixes this here. Video App: When I sync videos from my PC via iTunes with my iPhone, they will be saved in the Video app. I do not like it because I can not send the videos in this app. Pity vibration intensity can not be adjusted: In my opinion, the intensity could be increased slightly. In the motorcycle jacket e.g. I often do not realize that I am being called. Unfortunately, I do not hear the ringtone due to the wind noise (MX helmet). Camera hangs now and then: With the dark display, the only "software error" that I have found so far. When you start the app, the picture simply stops and nothing happens anymore. I have to quit the camera app and start again so I can take a picture. -NFC not unlocked: Personally, I think it's a pity. NFC offers cool options that unfortunately can not be used with the iPhone. Maybe that will happen. Conclusion: I'm completely honest. I do not regret buying the iPhone 6s! It's really a good phone that does a lot right. But here, too, there are things that are not quite optimal. However, for my part, I must say that I will change in a year or two. I miss the benefits that an Android phone has (whether Samsung, HTC or Huawei). That's it.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Dirk G.	3	With one hand, unfortunately, no longer in the upright format to use	2018-11-01	de	The iPhone 10 is unfortunately bad in one hand and the control panels are no longer reachable with the thumb. The now "virtual" homebutton is located at the bottom of the iPhone. In order to achieve this, the iPhone has to be gripped at the bottom, which then, due to the extended design, unfortunately leads to the one tilting the iPhone backwards out of his hand. The control center is now stored at the top right of the display, so far away from the homebutton. Both functions can only be reached via constant embrace. This is complicated and annoying. If the iPhone is turned from high to across, the screen rotates as usual. Unfortunately, it is now the case that due to the camera list in the upper part of the display, it looks like the display is defective in this area. Not nice either. With shocked I have now heard that the new iPhone 10 r is even longer, so the upright operation with one hand even less is possible. Face ID is stupid in the car: Previously could simply be pressed the homebutton to unlock the iPhone now must While driving, the iPhone will be properly aligned for faceid to work. This is actually impossible if the phone is in a rigid mobile phone car holder ... Otherwise, it should be mentioned here, the display, the camera, the photo software and the performance is breathtakingly good.	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	mario	5	Very good smartphone - rightly the number 1	2016-10-15	de	I have used the S4, S5 and also S6 edge from Samsung in recent years. Although I also use an iPad, I could never imagine getting an iPhone. With the devices from Samsung, the S4 and S5, I was very satisfied. Then the S6 came out and for me it was clear that the edge version will be my new device. Said and done. Now after 6 months of conclusion I am extremely disappointed with the S6 edge. I do not want to fix that on Samsung or the S6 edge as a whole. I want to relate it to the one device I had. Overheated device, system errors, extremely long repair times, etc. have now drawn the last nerve. So I am the dealer of my confidence in search of a smartphone. Here the S6, the S7 or even the iPhone was touted. Since I had not had good experiences with the S6 I reached for really long superior to the iPhone. Now a few days after the purchase, I have to honestly say that iPhone is really a big step ahead of the congruence.	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	3	iPhone XS problema antenna	2018-11-03	it	Antenna problems. I strongly advise against this if you have poor 3G / 4G or LTE signal reception. This is because the iPhone XS antennas have weaker reception than the data signal. It has a weaker reception than my old iPhone 5s (with this the signal is much stronger and more stable). With what it cost it had to be perfect. The IOS 12.1 software update has not solved the problem of signal strength and power.	0
iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Der gestiefelte Kater	2	Very disappointed with the quality	2017-03-18	de	My review only relates to the durability / sustainability of this product. Today's products are generally subject to a planned obsolescence should be clear to everyone (which is why one morally committed to our environment would be sustainable / Fairtrade products to buy). However, one can expect a cell phone to last at least two years until the next contract extension without major failures. Already with my previous Iphone 5s the Lightning connector was broken shortly after one year and had to be replaced. At the present 6s he has endured almost 1.5 years until I had to have him repaired for 70 €. Now shortly thereafter, the ear speaker has failed. All this despite the fact that my phone has been well maintained / protected all along (bulletproof glass, sturdy case, normal usage, no crashes). Overall, this is just very annoying and a huge impudence. For me, Apple products are therefore no longer in question in the future.	0

The first after an update of the operating system. The second in an exam by Apple. Actually, only the battery should be changed, since the capacity showed only 85%. Function of the iPhone up to the diagnosis perfectly. So sent in and waited. After careful examination of the Apple technicians a defect of the motherboard was found. Cost of repair 330, - €! That at a time when Apple is no longer allowed to sell Iphone 7 and 8 in Germany and break the sales figures. A rogue who thinks bad things! The theme of Iphone 6s has done for me.

s Face-ID works perfectly.

In addition to the usability of iPhones you fly through the Telefon.Wir we can after this first weekend no major criticisms (except for the subtle streak while scrolling). Apple has managed a great iPhone and adopted the design of its predecessor. We really enjoyed it. And yes with the Animojis (which you can also save in the Fotoapp and then send via WhatsApp).

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Malabulaba	1	Excessively overrated product with many disadvantages	2019-01-04	de	For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Use only if the phone with the display is up on the table Warranty / Guarantee: The iPhone XS is indeed high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Apple gives on its products generally only 12 months Manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the price policy actually almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone from the top My rating of one star refers exclusively to the criticisms mentioned above.Note: Factual comments I am willing to answer, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and not with criticism to be able to deal with! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Steffi1987	2	Too expensive for the actual product	2016-04-18	de	I am in possession of the shell since the end of January. The processing of the shell is ok. However for the price I would have liked a higher quality processing. Glued parts of the case were not really glued fit. The longevity of the case leaves a lot to be desired. For me breaks after the short use since the plastic of the holder for the smartphone. The iPhone has never fallen down. The phone is generally in my hand, on the desk or in my purse. Therefore, not understandable why the shell breaks. In itself, the window and the recess are very convenient. I can not determine a worse reception by using the case.

Often considered a simple evolution of the iPhone 7 (aesthetic very close except the glass back of the latest model), the iPhone 8 brings a few changes: - Faster (thanks to the A11 chip) - Better photo processing (you will find several tests on the net) - Compatible with the Qi charge ... And this is the novelty. Indeed, you can now charge the iPhone by putting it on a charger Qi ... No need to connect the iPhone.The nice thing also is that the memory capacity starts at 64gb (64gb or 256gb in fact). ... Despite this little change, the iPhone 8 (Plus) is a very good phone and we find the qualities of the brand.The screen is very good, the overall finish is very good, powerful and made beautiful photos (Obviously ... Accustomed to SLR ... Difficult to judge a smartphone on it ... But to troubleshoot, I find it convenient). Autonomy is good from the comparisons that we find ... Sorry ... I do not buy an array of Smartphone to compare:) ... Although I am amazed at the autonomy of my Samsung A5 2016 job that I only charge twice in the week (except for Cisco Spark and checking mails ... The use is only by telephone). Speaking of battery life ... The battery capacity is down compared to the iPhone 7 but it is obviously inconsequential ... Good ... For those who know the developments Apple, you will know that there is more to jack jacks (but the adapter is provided ... note that it can not be used wired). Several other brands have followed the movement ... Even Google who have made fun of Apple on this point ... By cons ... the iPhone 8 Plus is a heavyweight office compared to its competitors.If I compare the iPhone 8 Plus (offered to my wife) and my OnePlus 3T ... We feel the difference.Why so few changes? Just because of the iPhone X that will be released soon to write these lines.Quelles differences? Here is what I selected (in favor of the iPhone X of course): - Better screen resolution - Screen that occupies the entire surface before (or almost) - Facial identification.A still note for this last point, what the facial recognition of the iPhone X has nothing to do with that of the last Samsung that you can unlock with a simple photo (bravo security). Indeed, if I do not say nonsense, he There are 30000 IR control points on the iPhone X ... So, if you are in the dark, you put glasses or change your cuts, it will work (theoretically for now ... seen apart at the Keynote where we saw it in action ... And again ... There was a loupé ...). So ... Buy or not this iPhone 8 (Plus)? Ben ... Clearly, if you already have an iPhone 7 (More) ... The interest is minimalThe Smartphone is very expensive ... Damn ... 900 € !!! Well ... It is true that given the time that people spend above ... It's prorated more profitable than a lot of other things.The Smartphone remains a recurring budget for more and more people.The real question will remain ... iOS (the Apple system) or Android (a huge choice and for all budgets)? These are two different philosophies ... For my part, we chose an iPhone (and more specifically iOS) when: - we want to be quiet with a stable system - we want a smartphone turnkey without having to search right and left this or that application - we want to keep a system up to date (with Apple, when a new version of iOS comes out ... The update is available on all iPhone versions at the same time time...Except for the models of 5 years ago) - it does not necessarily hack his phone (easier on Android). I have the following iPhones: EDGE / 3GS / 5 / 5S and my wife the 4 or the 4S.This works ... Never had any particular problem (small bugs exist but it is rare and does not last) .Good, the only thing that can be boring is that we do not really feel to change the phone from one iPhone to the other. There are of course several improvements systems, etc ... A better responsiveness and everything ... But the system itself remains the same.On may be trying to go elsewhere ... But we are not necessarily conquered elsewhere ... My wife went on a OnePlus One after her iPhone ... She is not a fan of Android at all (and the phone has made the soul so good ). It has chained a number of problems ... Two trips / return service ... And more ... Just after the last service, the phone still has a problem ... But since the guarantee was passed and obviously at OnePlus they do not guarantee their repair (which had just been realized ... Two weeks ready) ... Not wanting to fight any longer.She is happy to have an iPhone again.My ... After my iPhone 5S, I went to Android with a OnePlus 3T.Pourquoi? Because of the price ... Do not hide the face.Some things irritated me on Android (to manage several mails ... A pleasant and free client ... Apart from BlueMail who did not always recover my mails automatically ... Pay to have a calendar in CalDAV while it is native on an iPhone, etc ...) but I'm not disappointed either. It's nice to be able for example to manage its downloads as if you were on your computer ... Or to add music without going through an application ... Have dual SIM (to manage the SIM card of work and that perso), etc.I will definitely go back to iOS for my next phone.That's my opinion ... :)	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	DerDirk	5	Change from the S6 edge	2016-02-18	de	I am very pleased with the iPhone 6s. Before the iP I had a Galaxy S6 edge, in itself not a bad device. But you can not compare the processing with the Apple.Beim the iP, I immediately had the latest IOS version available, as you know it at Apple. In contrast to Samsung in conjunction with a telecom branding. Here you wait partly months until the new version is available. As long as then vulnerabilities are open, and every hack is happy. The battery of the iP holds in my use about half a day longer than the S6 edge. There are certainly more points who are better or worse. But that would go beyond the scope. It's usually a religious war. I stay with Apple, because there is still something worth the phone after half a year. Greetings	0

iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Malabulaba	1	Excessively overrated product with many disadvantages	2019-01-01	de	For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Only good if the phone with the display is up on the table! Warranty / Guarantee: Although the iPhone X is really high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Stiftung Warentest rated the iPhone X even as "the most fragile iPhone ever". "Apple generally gives its products only 12 months of manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the pricing policy almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone X from the my assessment of a star refers exclusively to the criticisms mentioned above.Note: factual comments I am happy to answer, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and nicely with criticism ht can handle! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	N.	3	Interesting but ...	2017-05-22	fr	To make a comment clear iPhone 7 Gold 32 GOVendeur 639 eurosA originally, I was looking for an iPhone 6S, cheaper. I went to the Apple site, then other sites and I stumble on a iPhone 7 32 GB for a price lower than a 6S! A conble.Je sell my iPhone 5S speedy and place the order with some excitement (price, marketplace ...). The only point that reassured me was the compatibility "" Prenium "" of the product (without this logo I will not have ordered). Is this a refurbished phone? Opportunity ? Apple's unwanted? I get the phone the day after the order. The packaging is poor (- 1 star), there was no protection, bubble or foam, the packaging was really at least (same packaging as for CD / BluRay) .Ni one, nor two, I take the serial number on the box (with Eastern European scripts) and I check its guarantee on the Apple website. It has never been put into service, it is a new iPhone! I will not apologize for the iPhone 7, other reviews and sites do it better than me.I will add a note (which makes me remove another star from the product): This is the warranty. In France, the iPhone is guaranteed two years, thanks to the legal guarantee of conformity, a formidable weapon for the consumer, which poses in case of breakdown of the phone a presumption of defectiveness on the device ... The first year, you can go to Apple, they will handle the problem, the second, it will advise with the seller ... There the difficulties begin. In my opinion, when you buy here, with a third-party seller, who more abroad ... Admittedly, you will only have a one-year warranty, that of Apple and nothing else. It remains a contractual warranty, the AppleCare + 149 euros which will protect your iPhone for 3 years. This is a calculation to make.In summary: - iPhone 7 nine- Packaging too fragile for a product of this value, it is not a CD! - Attention to the guarantee which is de facto limited Finally, I am ALWAYS in the wait for the invoice from the seller. I will change this comment when I have it and if I do not have it, one less star. This will be embarrassing to resale in a few years.	0
iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Yassin	2	I would not recommend anyone !!!	2019-02-11	de	I have had many devices from Samsung to Apple to Huawei, the device is one of the biggest flops I ever had! Of course there are also positive sides such as eg. the camera or the really noble design but after I had the device in my hand I just thought my god how could I spend so much money on such a cell phone which honestly could not really convince me .. Let's get started the design itself is all very well, but of course the price is too exaggerated, because you only pay the logo .. the device I had some days of course in use it runs in the end quite fluently and has no jerks or such, apps open and close incredibly fast and the power quality is great, too, but you would have the price of about 150 to 200 ¬ set so that the device corresponds to its price, there are other Android devices that definitely for 450 to 500 ¬ as much and usually even have a better display .. An iPhone I would never buy back then the devices were still okay for the price but today is there s all GeldmagereiFor absolute Apple fans, the device is of course a highlight! And I say so the device ansich I liked quite okay but the price is what I am a thorn in the eye .. If my recession in the purchase decision helped him further, I would be happy about a helpful vote	0

iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Andynator	5	just an Apple	2017-03-15	de	Unfortunately, there are too many jealous people on the market who prefer to use Android phones. But let it be one for years and the market figures say it's a bad product just because you can not or do not want to afford it The phone is as always class-wise, of quality anyway and above all, stable in use. I have iPhones since Generation 4 and have never had a crash. We have in the household exclusively Apple products that work well with each other. There are 3 iPhones, 2 Mackbooks, a Mac Mini, 3 IPdas and an airport. There has never been any problem with any device, just once an application error promptly resolved by friendly service personnel. Also there is certainly how to call into the forest .... All in all, a phone without quirks. We will stay here in the future and can only recommend it.	0

Now comes the BUT, the battery leaves much to be desired. Already on the first day it turned off several times and indicated that the battery is empty although he still had at least 70%. After that, I was mad. However, it was strangely only when the phone was out in the cold for a long time. (When taking a photo etc.). Of course, that may not be synonymous ok but because of minus temperatures we currently have .. Well .. As soon as the phone but then again inside it had no more problems and worked flawlessly. I give the phone a little bit of time now vl just warned me of start-up problems and otherwise I'll send it back anyway !!!	0

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	michele di fronzo	5	Really a pretty sight	2017-11-07	it	iPhone 8? Three things: charging, grip and sound from the speakers. Which are not really aspects of the smartphone, but features added to the macro-features that already exist: autonomous charging, design grip and multimedia audio. There would be a little drawing to do, so simple to explain. IPhone 8, nice but always the same design since 2015iPhone 8, beautiful but still the same design since 20151. Top-up (wireless) I put wireless charging first because it's the only feature I'm already missing. It seems stupid and of little use, but having a support base on which to instantly load your smartphone is not foolish. For the occasion, I bought a recharge base on Amazon for € 9.99, which I placed on my bedside table in the bedroom. I don't know if it makes sense to take this base on the road, because it would only be something more to carry that would not give a real added value, compared to the normal USB-Lightning cable. I noticed that, with a cable, the iPhone 8 recharges 100% in about 1 hour, and with wireless charging in just under 2, but with the latter method the glass body behind warms up considerably. If it heats up in this period that the outside temperature is at maximum 28 degrees, I can only imagine what could happen in the summer with 40 degrees and more. In any case, wireless charging is very useful, especially since Apple has decided not to create its own standard, but to use the Qi standard which is very widespread.Grip, better with the iPhone 8 backside, grip is better with the shell rear in iPhone 8 glass, the grip is better with the rear body in glass I am trying out iPhone 8 while I look at that frying pan of the iPhone 7 Plus that I bought last year and which now seems terribly inefficient in terms of size. It almost seems that today, after all these models of smartphones with FullVision displays, InfinityDisplay and so on and so forth, "going back" to a smartphone with even a few millimeters of edges is like being back in 2003. As I have already written in the Galaxy S8 review, iPhone 7 Plus looks ugly and old to me. iPhone 8 has the exact same form factor as its predecessor, yet the rear glass body removes a bit of bitterness in the mouth. It is not just a matter of appearance: iPhoneItalia dear Andrea Cervone recently released a video on Youtube which clearly shows that glass resists all kinds of falls, and only yields to absurd falls - like those from a balcony.iPhone 8 doesn't seem to break even if you kick it and hit it against a tree. Seeing is believing. I obviously haven't tried it. Last, but not least, is the audio: it seems that many producers have made up their minds to turn their laptop and smartphone into speakers, because even iPhone 8 earns a good percentage more decibels, if we can say so. The volume is higher than the previous ones and the Galaxy S8, and it's really clean. Yes, it could be a reason to switch to iPhone 8, but not for me for example. And then? IPhone 8 actually has changes under the shell. But they are not very relevant. There is the new A11 Bionic chip, which has a dedicated processor for machine learning (but now is of little use), there is also a renewed camera that takes photos and shoots videos 2% better than the iPhone 7. And on iPhone 8 Plus there is the dual camera with which you can use Portrait Lighting, a mode that acts in real time on the portrait and highlights it, or puts it in black and white, and so on. For now, though, they're all games, the real applications that can take advantage of the A11 Bionic chip are still work in progress. I have said that neither iPhone 8 nor iPhone X are the real news from Apple, because Apple's direction is on reality (increased) - even Valentino, in his article, delves into augmented reality and the iPhone. In short, iPhone 8 is a small step forward, because one step was necessary to do so. Of course, 50% of iPhone users are waiting for the iPhone X because it is the most expensive smartphone for consumers in history (I don't count special editions and luxury smartphones). So, in a nutshell: if you come from iPhone 6 or earlier, iPhone 8 will be a big step forward. Otherwise, go ahead: the revolution has yet to come.	0

And I love big phones! What would you recommend? Which of the 3's? Please only give some tips that have the respective IPhones :) that would help me the most !! I would buy the iPhone and not here in Germany, but in Switzerland:) To a lot of cheaper, of course, connects one then with a holiday :) or rather the other way round: Please ask for tips.

iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	rumpelstielchen	3	My first I Phone ... maybe the last one ...	2018-02-03	de	To prehistory: I have previously used a Microsoft Lumia 950 Dual Sim phone. That was just convenient because I only had to lug around a cell phone with me and was separated professionally and privately just clean. In addition, the compatibility with the company software was given, which then animated me to buy Lumia. Meanwhile, my company switched to I Phones. Since there are no Apple Dual SIM variants (why probably only Apple) and an Android phone for me was out of the question (very bad experience from the past), so I decided to buy the I Phone 8.The first surprises I experienced while transferring the data from the old phone to the I Phone. Without I Tunes or I Cloud nothing works ... Whats App Backups from Windows transferred ... Pustekuchen. That was a lot easier with Windows ... The operating system seems a lot more complicated than WIN10 mobile. Example: I tried to write a mail and in parallel to look in another mail what ... does not work ... or I'm too stupid for who knows ... But there are of course also positive to report: The feel, the speed, the camera and the stability of the operating system as well as the hardware processing are really great. But you may also ask for a price of over 700, - €. Overall, I understand the hype about Apple products but not quite. For my part, I feel already bothered by the compulsive defaults that Apple partially makes (software use, memory upgrades, battery, etc ...). Whether I will stay with Apple will show the time. Too bad that it has not understood the leadership of Microsoft, to gain a foothold in the mobile phone market ... From the handling was my WIN10 mobile by far the most ...	0

iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Thomas	5	Excellent smartphone! Review of a Galaxy S4 / S6 changer	2015-11-01	de	Hi, I have after the S4 / S6 iPhone 6S in 64 GB increased and thus leave the Android OS for the time being. The iPhone I did not buy at Amazon (1019 ¬) but at Media Markt (849 ¬). Impression after a Week iPhone 6S use. The iPhone feels like a one-stop shop. Great look, great processing. The battery holds and holds. Even if the battery has become smaller, it lasts longer than most Android with the thick Akkus.Morgens at 8 o'clock at 100%, with some phone calls, check e-mail more often, online banking I'm at 18 o'clock at 73%. Standby time is terrific like the macbooks. Barely loses% over the night. Runs very smoothly, fingerprint very fast, high data security (rights of the apps can be easily limited). More impressions after 2 weeks The battery continues to keep excellent by s.o. even with Powerusing I am at over 60% on a working day of 10h. Constant phone calls, use notes, send e-mail, Internet research, news apps. The synchronization is of course made great no matter where I write what (notes / calendar) Mac or iCloud it lands on the iPhone and vice versa. The camera is also great. Pictures are similar to the S6 Edge pictures. Here, the ghosts divide between camera Phanatikern.Force Touch is nice but I personally use little. The display is crisp and very bright and very pleasant colors. The OS is of course strongly based on OSX and MacUser should find themselves very quickly cope anyway .Siri has been developed significantly and now understands very well. Dates, alarms, reminders, photos, phone calls, navigations are no problem for Siri. Even something like "" Siri I have a cold or I'm sick "" Siri understands and suggests doctors in your area. Super thing.Klare Kaufempfehlung.Long again Android fanatics claim the iPhone 6S is technically not up to par. The Geekbench tests prove just the opposite. In the area of ​​performance, all current smartphones are facing the rear of the iPhone. It does not need any, yes, but I have an 8 core processor to come.	0

New to me on an i phone there is information on battery performance and this phone arrived with 78%, this was its optimum performance capability. In reality that means I am getting less than two hours usage between charges which is not good by any standard, given this is a refurbished phone it would have been useful for such vital information to be included in the advert. I am now forced to obtain a new battery which makes the initially attractive cost of this phone greater than I had hoped. An almost perfect product ruined through lack of information by the seller.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Jeffrey van Dijk	5	Absolutely recommended <3	2017-08-07	de	Hello, in advance I apologize for my spelling. Who wants a short conclusion should rather read the last section below. To me and the choice of this smartphone: I am zz. 20 years old and have already quite a LOT of mobile phones durch.Ich grew up in my childhood without a telephone or other Schnick Schnack. I had only one Gameboy. My first phone I got in the 7th grade (a LG KP500) which was a touch phone. After some time I got my second mobile phone a samsung galaxy (with some longer number) my very first "" smartphone "" admitted I did not use all these "" crass "" features of a smartphone. I only needed it to write with friends on WhatsApp or Facebook and Telln with Muddi. Also this phone broke sometime, because I had to buy my own smartphone. This was not possible without a side job ... so now a wanted (newspaper distribution) and money saved. Back then I bought a Kazam (a cheap China brand) I was just not willing to pay 100 Euro for a cell phone. However, this phone was broken. After several years and teachers phones from samsung Sony and co. I thought to buy an iPhone, these were so popular and gehyped .. now with the beginning of my apprenticeship, I bought my first hand on financing, no problem had been counted 200 € and twice a year then a rate of 35 €. Good deal I thought to me ... but even this Telefong broke after a year. (I was more excited about Apple than any of the other phones I've had.Because it was not plastic special alu, was not unnecessarily huge and the operating system was mega easy to understand). One year later (last year) Kahm then samsung Galaxy s7 out .. it was praised so much that I decided to one Contract with mobilcom debitel to take with just this phone. Absolute wrong decision. I do not want to say that the phone is bad, but it was much harder to get along with this phone than with an iPhone .. just because it has too many features I do not need. It was down to me after 3 weeks and was broken in spite of bulletproof glass and cell phone case ... I had ne insurance but from suitable laziness I have not given it. Logically, it broke more and more and now after a year I faxed it thick. I have now bought an iPhone 7 directly from Apple on financing, with 100 € deposit and a half-yearly rate of 80 €. Many think now, what a spast but not just not. I have now brought the s7 for repair and then sell it for 350 ¬ of which I pay the iPhone 7 with. Why the iPhone 7 and not wait for a new one? Why an iPhone generally? Is it worth it for me to use an iPhone? Well I'm not waiting for the new iPhone for the reason that it probably will be priceless anyway because there is an anniversary coming up. I just think that the operating system IOS is easy to understand and clear. It offers certain advantages over android, for example that more people are hacked using android because it is simply more represented. If you are crazy about games you have the advantage that most of the known games come first for iOS than for android. Personally, I find it extremely noble that the Apple for its iPhone on aluminum as a frame, etc, it just feels PORN **. Apple stands for premium (others may see it differently, but I do not) Some argue about the technical data of the different phones, personally I do not care about whether a mobile app opens at the speed of light or not, it is important to me It is worthwhile to buy an iPhone 7 only if you have not had a newer iPhone for some time or if you tell yourself you want the latest from the new one to have it in the Compared to the iPhone 6s not much changed, the button is now a touch sensor instead of a real button, there is no aux more, instead stereo speakers (the aux is missing is absolutely not bad as I think). The iPhone 7 lasts for about 45 minutes in the water and the iPhone 6s never 5 minutes. If you want to have the technical data in mind, however, should ask a professional or read the Internet smart. My personal conclusion is: it's worth it, it's fun and offers exactly what you imagine. Thank you for your attention	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Roberto	2	This time no quality leap	2017-02-05	it	After buying the new apple smartphone from Apple and after months of use (having had all the iphone models) I can express an opinion. Starting from the packaging you immediately notice the savings, unlike the 6s box, in particular the headphone box that this time it is in very bad cartoncino.Fino to arrive to the use proper of the cell, equal to the previous model if not worsened above all to aesthetic level. The design is the same as that of a last-generation ipod (almost anonymous). Compared to the 6s, it no longer has the physical home button but has been replaced by a fake one that does not at all give the idea of ​​pressing a button, and also lacks the headphone jack and you need to add an adapter (fortunately supplied). It is no longer possible to listen to music if the cell is charging for this reason (unless you spend 170 euros for some awful bluetooth headphones). Also I noticed that starting from 6 it is now full of lag (something that the iphone have never had at least until 5s). Fortunately, many corrections arrive thanks to the frequent updates of ios. The only positive note is that it is now water resistant but as usual apple does not cover the damages caused by the immersion of the cell in the latter, so I will not try absolutely at do it or imagine it! The speed compared to that of the 6s is practically identical in my opinion, as for the quality of the camera. Fluid only in games. I would have expected a real change and I think that for this we have to wait for a long time, at least until the iPhone 8 comes out, since the 7s will be the usual heated soup. So in conclusion neither is it worth it to go from 6s (64gb) at 7 (32gb)? DEFINITELY NO! By now the competition is offering much better products at a lower price. This iphone is fortunate to always be a fashionable item but in the long run if apple won't be woken up I don't think I'll buy it anymore!	0

The unlock is almost instantaneous on an iPhone 8 by pressing the Home button on the screen. iPhone X must: 1- that the device understands all one wants to unlock it by analyzing the movements of the device, often either he understands nothing at all, or it triggers facial recognition too early. 2- You have to catch the small tab at the bottom of the screen and put it up so as to indicate to the phone that you want to use it (I never understood why they put this step) If we add the many editors of apps that have not updated their apps for the screen of the iPhone X and the repeated bugs of iOS on iPhone X, I can say that it is with undisguised joy that I return to the iPhone 8.	0

I was strongly undecided between XR and XS but then I thought that the difference of € 250 was not justified and so here I am with the XR in my hands. capacity, color and size are subjective so I will not dwell on these issues. AESTHETICS: then it is not at the level of XS for example, indeed I find that some colors make it look like a toy but once put the cover goes all in second flat. BATTERY is infinite, never happened to me that I could not download a phone even though I wanted to. mainly use whatsapp Facebook and instagram, I call and take pictures, nothing else. and although I live with the phone in hand, the battery takes an eternity to discharge, never seen anything like that.FOTOCAMERAwow, really a very good level compared to my old model (but it is also obvious), above all I was surprised by the photos made in the dark, they are very bright and come well! in general I find it is an "inexpensive" model that is worth much more than the top range of other brands! I only noticed 2 flaws, but we are serious ?! how should i put the phone on the surfaces? finding a cover that corrects this defect is not quite as simple as it sounds. there is no headphone jack: again, but are we serious ?! I don't think it's nice to push buyers to buy the adapter or the airpods (given the inexpensive cost of the phone)	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Christopher	5	Super Smartphone!	2018-02-19	de	I'm a big fan of the Apple smartphones and I have my iPhone 6s now over 2 years and will certainly have at least another 2 years! In these 2 years, my smartphone has rarely had problems, and these were really not tragic. Once off and on and the problem was fixed again. (I take care of my phone very well, I can count it on both hands, how many times I've fallen down in the last 2 years, and mostly on a rug.) Furthermore, the speed of the software despite the high Age and iOS 11 still great. I never really have a problem that the smartphone hangs open briefly when opening an app. The only thing that I can fault is the battery performance. The capacity was not as good as other new smartphones from the start and its old age and the new software updates did not make it any better, but I usually get through pretty well most of the day, even though I have all sorts of social media apps and apps Use music apps during the bus ride. Sometimes I even get two days with a load! All in all, a really great phone, which really gave me a lot of pleasure, which is why I gave another copy of my mother's birthday and she's been blown away!	0

My daughter was already a few weeks ago at the Apple Store in Munich, they have looked at the phone, but unfortunately could not fix it. That can happen.

iPhone XR	128GB	Black	RugCo	4	Good product except for the FaceID	2019-02-13	it	The characteristics of the product do not require evaluations being a hyper-known device and covered by any type of review; on a personal note, however, I find the Face ID absolutely inconvenient .. by its nature it does not allow you to unlock the phone unless you hold the device in your hand while watching the screen, it works badly in the dark and in any case is not foolproof even in normal lighting conditions. The Touch ID was definitely more practical, I hope they find a way to reinstate it.	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent	mathlann	3	If you come from iOs you will like it	2018-12-23	fr	Bigger than my iPhone7 that it replaces, the iPhone XS hardly fits in the pocket. Moreover with its 208g, it does not pose any problems to jeans but it deforms the pants with less held. In terms of reproaches there is always the lack of the headphone jack which remains a real mess day by day. You have to choose between charging, and having sound. The lightning doubler adapters turning this phone into a real gas plant. So as soon as we have a plug charge we do not break down. And as soon as it rings, we unplug and put on the headphones. We plug in, we unplug, we plug in unplugged .... painful, especially that we still do not fall out of battery anyway and here it is torticolis insured to hold such stuck to the ear while charging the l iPhone and have both hands on the keyboard. So, the parade I have is to have kept the 7 in which I put a chip to 2E at free. And when the XS is HS I make a call back on the 7, which allows me to reload the XS. The slab is less resistant to scratches than the iPhone 7, I already have micro scratches. I have a Mac under 10.11 that I do not want to evolve for issues of software accounting and peripherals. This bone is not old (my iMac is only 2 years and a half!) And yet, it is impossible to swallow the new format of video in H265, nor the photos in HEIF, and Apple does not provide any updates. codec day to settle this, it's just for me unacceptable. So there are workarounds via third-party software, month I make a copy in synology drive, then I get back my photos and video on my NAS that I converted into a suite with handbrake for videos and iMazing HEIC Converter for photos. But it's really painful. Other worries more related to the Apple environment, it is possible to share in airplay the iPhone screen on an Apple TV, but not on a mac .... Except that when you do a quick meeting in an office a lot of people have a mac but no one has AppleTV. So we often find ourselves at 3 or 4 around the tiny screen of the iPhone to zoom and unzoom a document ... .. And as you will always in the middle a follower of android you will not miss a few jokes.And do not use siri, otherwise you will become the Turkish head of the meeting. Apple has removed the touchID in favor of faceID. Except that if like me you're never in front of your tel (put on a support) and well we spend his time doing the code. And it's a big step backwards. FaceID is good, but having a touchID under the screen for example would have been even better! So why not take an android. Really I asked myself this question, and if the pixel3 had had a headphone jack I would have switched. But iOs is much more secure than Android. Believe me, this is my job, there is no debate on it.Privacy is much better guaranteed by Apple.My personal and work environment is entirely on Apple for over 18 years, and I There are my habits. The quality of the product is very good, and my old iPhones still work, including my 3GS that my daughter uses. I had a breakdown on my iPhone 5S and Apple had changed it at the time. The photo and video quality is very good for a smartphone, and the dynamic range much better than my 7. Plus Stabilization allows you to take pictures by hand in low light without being blurred. Disadvantage, I have not yet found a good setup to pair it with my gyro stabilizer. The iPhone7 makes better video with an external stabilizer.iMessage does not exist under android and I use it all the time. I am continuously online and therefore very difficult to join. My mail is systematically saturated. So iMessage allows me to hold several conversations at the same time and several by "chat" even though I'm already at the tel.The quality of display is excelle (almost too because very flattering in terms of rendering) iOs is stable and intuitive . I quickly took the shot of the new gestures. The iPhone XS is powerful and fast, and it is for me a tool of work, so I need a very reactive device. I have a lot of applications that I bought on the store, if I change the dairy, I should buy them.En conclusion the iPhone SX is a very good phone, but a lot of pettiness on the part of Apple spoils the use of the day the day and the price of the terminal is hard to swallow. I left on an iPhone. But not sure that the next is one.	0

This super mega-sharp Oled display can not be true white and black. It has a strong yellowish tinge that is unacceptable to me. Of course I have turned off True Tone and all that and even worked only in the shades of gray over the color filter = yellow! .All of my photos I made in SW with my Canon 5D mark4 have elaborately edited in Photoshop, are now yellowish. The SW effect of these images is now totally meaningless. Likewise, I find the reading on my iPhone 7 easier than the XS, since the contrast is clearer. Of course, I realize that the resolution of the OLED display is much higher, but this difference takes the human eye was not more.This not yet mature 1249 ¬ mobile phone I send back and I will buy the iPhone 8 mitguter old quality.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Marc Noack	2	Good but bad ...	2019-01-02	de	A good device, but I still forgive only two stars. I bought the iPhone in December 2017, so it has now "tested" a good one year. I think on the basic materials and on the software, I do not have eingehen.Was the quality Furthermore, the fact that iPhone scratched extremely fast, especially the frame, which is why I use an armored film and a protective cover, does not look sooo good, but otherwise the iPhone would not look good long. What the price / delivery / quality concernsThe iPhone cost 1,149 Euro and that's really hard. The package is nothing special included, I would have liked an alternative to the wired headphones in particular. In Decmeber 2018 it was time, the touch screen made great problems, hardly responded. From the next Apple authorized dealer, matching the problem, Apple has just launched a recall, waiting for the repair 1 month, there is no loaner. So you buy a premium product and then the service is, well ... If you now compare the iPhone with the Huawei P20 Pro (which costs less than half), the question is "what exactly is so much better on the iPhone now, what makes the enormous higher price? ". I can not answer this question, because other phones are at least as good. So the iPhone X is a good phone, but it is not better than others and it is worth the extra price by no means. For me it is therefore the last Apple product I bought, because I do not want to support this exaggeration.	0
iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	David	4	Read the description carefully	2019-01-03	us	I bought this iPhone before they changed the title and added [Locked to SimpleMobile]. The title exclusively said (unlocked) so I purchased this expecting an unlocked device.On arrival I unboxed the phone, the box was not open or damaged so it was a pretty decent experience. The trouble started when I put my T-Mobile SIM card in only to get the invalid SIM card message. I couldn’t get to the home screen or anything.I went back to Amazon to closely inspect the description, and sure enough at the very very bottom it said it was locked to SimpleMobile. No surprise here, but it was strongly misleading when the title stated it was UNLOCKED (hence why they finally changed the title now).But besides that it’s a brand new phone, no other complaints. Comes with all the original accessories. Only word of advice next time is to read the entire description carefully (at least skim it over)	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Amazon-Kunde	5	Top cell phone for a lot of money	2016-11-27	de	I used the iphone 4s for 4-5 years and then opted for the 6s as it was cheaper than the 7 and in my opinion not much worse. The first few days were a bit strange due to the size but you get used to it quickly. What bothered me a lot is that it has slipped so often out of my hand. I then bought a silicone sleeve. That helped, but of course it does not look that great anymore. If you own an iphone 6 or 6 plus and are considering buying a new one, I can only say, "it's not worth it". Spending so much money for not much more power is blatant in my eyes. An upgrade is in my opinion until the 5s and down to consider. Who says anyway, "" hey I need a new phone "" I can only recommend the 6s. Except for the mentioned smooth surface, I have nothing on the device suspend.I hope I could help a bit.	0

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	T.S.	1	More Pleasant Apple Fan	2019-04-09	de	In a nutshell: The technique of this device is the lowest cannon. I switched from an ip7s to the xr and am still disappointed 4 months after purchase. The disappointment is also getting bigger, the more software problems are added. Where should I start ? Face ID: she does not recognize me when it is too dark, when the phone is too far away from the face or when I wear sunglasses. Too: is feeling worse than from the 7s, many movements and gestures are barely or not recognized Incidentally, this device has no more 3D touch, where I think with the flashlight function you could have used this well here ... pity Resolution: if a friend shows me samsung for 150 ¬ less, sometimes I could just cry. I use and I can only warn at the moment !!! Apple says it was due to the software, but already for 3 months? Very often, one of the two Sim's.his disabled, there are no calls or text messages' But as long as you do not want to send or dial out via this number, you just do not notice it and wonder why nobody answers. The reception is still displayed normally, so there is no way to be aware of it , When the device restarts the problem is fixed. The first month everything worked and since the 2 month I have to restart the device every 2-3 days.	0

A nightmare. You should really only make phone calls via headphones. Predecessor models were already extremely borderline with SAR values ​​of 0.93 to 0.97 (w / kg). Laymen should inform themselves at the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (bfs.de) or consumer protection. Further technical innovations: In short "" Nothing new in the West "". Lots of money, lots of chi-chi, which you do not need. Each buyer should know that Apple pays almost no taxes on this product in Europe, while the production costs for this phone are around 20-40 €. In short asocial.	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	MRG	1	Volume knob broken at the factory	2019-01-13	de	After I had decided to spend 1220 EUR for an iPhone XS Silver, I was looking forward to the new device. Recently, I had an iPhone SE. The device makes a good visual impression, but turned out quickly that the joy will be short lived. Because the device was delivered from the factory with a broken volume knob. So if I'm currently unintentionally adjusting the volume for music or calls, there's no way to fix it. Apple has suggested sending the device and sending it back in 10 days. They would even pick it up. Alternatively, I'm allowed one day to go from Apple's election to a store and talk to a technician there. However, only at 10 o'clock in the morning. Sure, "who else is working if he can buy an iPhone for 1220", is probably the logic. I'm terribly disappointed with Apple.

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	M. L.	4	Almost perfect smartphone according to today's standard	2017-10-19	de	Hello, First of all, I switched from an iPhone 5S to the iPhone 8, which of course is a quantum leap. In addition to many new features, wireless charging, water-repellent or waterproof, larger display have the usual abilities such as camera, touch ID, processor, speakers, Unfortunately, the iPhone also has some "smaller" disadvantages. First, let's take a look at the "" highlights "" - the camera is absolute cream, the iPhone shoots classy photos in good light conditions Users are completely sufficient. In poor lighting conditions, you just realize that it is a smartphone and not a real camera. The photos are indeed usable, for a smartphone certainly synonymous with the top 3 smartphone cameras but just not suitable for a glossy magazine.- The display is sufficiently sharp and offers very natural colors. The brightness is also great. The viewing angle is not distorted the good presentation.- The processor is fast, nothing hooked, I think here you are well stocked for 3-4 years.- The processing on the iPhone is impeccable.Otherwise, it has all the typical Apple advantages, the largest is iOS 11, a clear, varied and I think secure operating system with about 4-5 years support for updates. This is an absolute unique selling point which I do not want to miss. Now the negative characteristics - the battery is enough for 1 day of intensive use, 2 days of normal use, that's a pity since it would have been more feasible. - The design is indeed timelessly beautiful, Nevertheless, the edges are too thick by today's standard, you could have built the iPhone with the same screen size certainly more compact. I assume Apple does not do that for production reasons, as it will be cheaper to continue using the almost old dimensions. But that's just a guess. The dual camera would have earned the iPhone 8 at this price, the PLUS model is simply too big for many. It's a pity that the Apple is still different. Neutral, I see the price, everyone can decide how much he spends. Class I think that Apple also older models (iPhone 7), etc. in the program reserves, so there is actually an iPhone for every budget. That's why I do not understand the price discussions, whoever wants to have the latest, fastest, best just has to put notes on the table. Punkt.Ebenso I refer to the very good resale value of iPhones, if you treat them reasonably you can even after 2-3 years still require several hundred euros for it. This does not work for Samsung and Co. These are somehow verramscht.Ich hope that I could help some with this review.	0

iPhone XS Max	256GB	Gray	MK	5	Size matters!	2018-12-30	it	Please forgive the bad double meaning in the title, I could not resist, but as you will understand by reading my review, the real feature that distinguishes Iphone Xs Max from the Xs is mainly this, and is perhaps also the only noteworthy one. Let's start with a premise. Despite not being a kangaroo, in the summer, I have to go around with the baby carrier. I'll explain. Keys to the home, office, car, personal cell phone, work cell phone, cigarettes (seriously harms health, ed), earphones ... I don't know where to put the stuff anymore. Another tragedy of biblical proportions, somewhat unusual, is that my partner does not like to go around with the bag, so I can also forget the classic "Love, can't you keep me 2 tons of junk?". Now let's imagine if I can afford a device that measures the beauty of almost 16 cm in height and almost 8 in width ... more covers. Come on, it's a frying pan, let's face it. Don't get me wrong, it's not always bad, but you have to deal with the clutter. For the rest Xs and Xs Max have common strengths and weaknesses, let's examine them together. Let's start from the latter. -The notch. By dint of talking badly about it alive in fear of finding it under my house with a bat in my hand. But I can't fail, it's stronger than me. The wonderful black cleat stuffed with equally wonderful and ultra-technological sensors is always in the middle of the boxes. First it takes away a portion of the screen, so photos, videos, applications will be cut or you will have a creepy dark hunchback that invades the display. Secondly it takes away space from the icons. Do you want to check the remaining battery percentage? Down the drop-down menu! Will the Bluetooth be turned on? Down the drop-down menu! What operator am I connected to? Down the drop-down menu! Is it a phone or a roller shutter? Guys, they took it out this year. The quality is not discussed, and that is paid, you know, but this Max is out of place. Much of the price is bitten melina. It is equally true that no one forces us to buy it and that, with their own money, everyone does what he wants. - The name. Iphone Xs Max. Ok, the question is negligible, I agree, but it still seems ridiculous to me.-The processor. Someone is kind enough to explain to me what you do with a phone that has a processor that could handle a shuttle? Virtual reality is still embryonic, the games don't even comment on them, saving a few thousandths of a second in posting the photo of the schnitzel with ginger sauce, on a bed of rocket, with a side of Jerusalem artichoke and sprinkle of balsamic vinegar on Instagram? But eating that gets cold, no ??? It looks ugly. What then, just enter a public office and throw away half a day, eh but the phone must be a splinter ...- The physical keys.Now the power button calls up Siri, to turn off the phone you have to simultaneously press the minus volume key and the power key, for the screenshots plus volume key and power key. Scomodo.-Siri. Nothing ... despite the shortcuts we are still light years away from the Google assistant. - No hole for the headphones and no jack / lightning adapter in the package. They risked financial ruin for the latter. - Animoji and memoji. Now, with all due respect ... but what really? Or are you a 6 year old child or what would be the utility? Make you pass for a fool even during messages and video calls? What then at least save us the presentations of the river of ste ca ... stupid! -The camera. Protruding. Ugly, at greater risk of bumps and uncomfortable. The device, if placed on its back on the back, will inevitably sway and go to the macarena. Good for lovers of Jennifer Lopez, but to me the Latin American dances suck ... also because I have the movements of a bedside table ... of Ikea ... broken ...- Battery. It has never been one of the strong points of Apple products and neither is it in this case. Slightly better than the Xs but slightly worse than the Xr. You can make it a busy day. But it doesn't advance much. -Size.Here we are. It is not a featherweight, difficult to use with one hand, the reachability function helps. In summer, if you make a long call, you will have a fantastic spot of pan on your face, complete with a bitten apple in relief. Call in the shade! It is a function to avoid melanoma. Oled from 6.5 against 5.8 of Xs. Only and only difference between the top of the range of this year. Pray.-Dimensions. Cross and delight. But do you want to show a film on such a generous display? A show also with photos. Exceptional with every light condition! 6.5 inches of pure visual perfection! If only it made me look younger it would be perfect. Instead nothing. -Face-Id is foolproof and very fast, even with sunglasses or little light zero problems. If he recognizes my big face just awake, he can recognize anyone, trust me! -Dual Sim. The new iPhones introduce dual SIM functionality into the Apple ecosystem. Which as usual does in its own way: the second card must be digital (eSIM), a format still very little popular in Italy. Too much effort to put the double slot like in China, on the other hand the phone is small ...- Photographic compartment. Difficult to get a bad photo, flawless bokeh effect. Even if you are not a professional, the results will amaze you. Video on the same level. Far beyond the normal needs of a non-professional user. -The processor. But how? Didn't you say that it was an exaggeration, that from here, that from there .... but you have to come and do the picky right here? Phew ... where did we stay before you interrupted me? Ah yes, the processor. Never a lag, never an uncertainty, always fluid, in every situation. Using this Xs Max is a pleasure. Always. With all due respect to my considerations set out between the defects and my consistency. -Audio. Greatly improved compared to previous generations. So much better that if you have Gigi D’Alessio songs in the playlists, they will be automatically deleted. - Build quality. It is an iPhone and you can hear it. Manic as always. With what it costs ... God forbid! - Hardware / software integration always at the top. It is a reliable and simple travel companion in its daily use, you will never have to make too many concussions to keep it in perfect shape. - The Apple ecosystem, closed but at the same time so reassuring, and continuous updates. store.-reception. Bt, cell phone and wifi. Never encountered a problem on the models in my possession. Connections always stable and fast. It may seem silly but ... everything works well! Certainly there are some defects, I have listed them above, but believe me, once you have this concentration of technology in hand, they will pass into the background. Basically, if you are looking for a device with a "big screen" and if bulky size and price are not a problem, you have found what is right for you. You could easily read these few lines and save yourself the rambling above. I think that tomorrow I will have to look good before crossing the road ... And the time has come for excuses. I apologize for some copy / paste too much with my Xs rece, but guys, they are the same, by now you will understand what changes ... so it's not my fault but Apple's. I also apologize to the fans of Gigi D'Alessio, Jennifer Lopez, lovers of Latin-American dances, Ikea, Apple, kangaroos, public offices, bedside tables, frying pans and cutlet. Just kidding. Maybe. With the "Notch" I do not apologize, with the one just not! I hope I snatched a smile from you and I don't know how, by rereading the review, you have been useful. What a delirium ...	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Axel	4	Everything super - only as a phone with light and shadow	2017-01-17	de	First of all, the iPhone 7 is an iPhone and thus a device that is difficult to compare because bare data and benchmarks are meaningless in this optimally hardware-based operating system. Even with 4 instead of 8 cores and 2 instead of 4 or more GB Ram runs the iPhone in terms of speed. Fantastic! What I noticed otherwise positive or, compared with previous models has been improved: + Camera, finally with optical image stabilizer and bright aperture. Not the best camera on the market, but the differences to a Galaxy S7 or Google Pixel are often a matter of opinion or hardly recognizable to the layman. A very useful always-on camera + working speed is great, although the 32 GB variants are indeed slower / should be as the 128 or 256 GB. One does not notice, everything runs smoothly. Ruckler practically never exists. + IOS 10: Finally more widgets, more quick settings + 3D Touch: Great, I use this a lot and since the iPhone 6s introduced this technique, there are now plenty of apps offering this contextual feature + Audio quality : Both as a speaker (STEREO!) And with headphones or via Bluetooth to an external device: The sound is always very good to excellent. I had previously the LG G4, which had a terrific camera, but the video shoot or music playback sound had so disappointed. This is not the case here. Super. I work as a journalist and no longer take my digital recording device with me, have even given audio tracks to radio colleagues, was suitable for broadcasting. + VIDEOS: The video quality is the best I have seen in a smartphone so far. It's unbelievable how shake-free you can film how good the sound is + Apps: Since Apple's Appstore is still the toughest developer app, many apps I've previously used on Android are a little better in detail, faster, more precise or fall-proof. Ex: Under Android often crashes in track recording despite potent hardware. Here everything always immediately usable and exactly + GPS: My LG G4 jogging me at a total of 6 kilometers of track always at least 500 meters "" stolen "". The iPhone is as accurate as the GPS in the car (which was the winner of the test). So jogging or tracking is fun! These points are to be evaluated neutral, because they are not negative in the evaluation, but are also not great. I'm sure not the first one who is upset about it, but until you get the content from the computer to the Pulling iPhone you want takes hours, because you often either sync everything or nothing until you see how that works. Or. Yes, you know it before and calms down when buying with the supposedly good resale value, but still you get for an iPhone two washing machines in the equivalent. Krass. But you buy one then. In this respect...o Ecosystem Apple: No dragging and dropping of files - that's also known before, also that you do not make songs into ringtones and other customizations. And yet, everything also has a benefit: iOS is not as sensitive as Android for a long time. I notice that after a few weeks. Blessing and curse at the same time. Finally, the iPhone 7 is a very good, but not a perfect smartphone and therefore it has two negative points, which cost in my rating a star altogether The iPhone breaks more than all the phones that I had before , Talks or breaks connections, even in the city in best reception. I do not know why. An update and a visit to the Applestore have done nothing, nor the exchange of the sim card. It is striking that in between a week goes well and then can be very bad again. I observe this and write here, if necessary, an update, if the software should improve this at some point. It's definitely annoying because this is the basic function of a cellphone. And I feel reminded of the iPhone 4 and 5, which were similarly bad for telephoning.- The SAR value: Just because the iPhone 7 is so bad to talk on the phone, it is even more amazing and annoying that the phone has such a strong radiation value of more than 1.3 w / kg. The Samsung Galaxy S7 radiates less than a third as strong and has a very good cell phone reception after tests. Why, Apple? Since I usually use the phone via headset for telephoning, I personally do not worry about it, but basically questioning this is already.- Sound via headphones: Due to the omission of the jack connector, you can almost only hear about the digital Lightning Output or via adapter, if you want to hear with cable. The omission does not bother me, but probably the quality. The sound is still loud enough and very clear, but compared to the iPhone 6 or 6s, the basses have disappeared. Very middle and high altitude sound. Crystal clear, but it lacks the bang through the bass. Too bad. Altogether still neat, but for 700 Euro ... CONCLUSION: The iPhone 7 is the best smartphone that I know, but still does not deserve 5 stars, because it can not be fully recommended as a phone and for a smartphone in 2017 one has too high a radiation value.	0

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Jupiter III	2	Paper tiger for 6S owners	2017-11-12	de	3G, 4, 5, 6 Plus, 6S Plus. The 8 Plus is the first iPhone, the purchase of which I regret and gives me little added value in practice compared to the 6S Plus, on the contrary. This starts with the very nature of a phone calling , Directly after delivery discussions were accompanied by an unpleasant crackle. A later version of iOS brought a workaround by software, yet voices sound much more metallic flatter, unnatural than the iPhone 6S. Something that not only shows on the phone, but also the sound of video recordings. Photos and videos have more dynamics in the evening or dark situations and the white balance is better. In addition, there is 4K recording capability with 60fps and higher frame rate in slow motion. Something that you can only use if you leave the default set more compressed encoding format. Compared to the normal video / image format, it saves a lot of space, but the pictures are muddy, details are lost, so that in sum there is hardly any benefit left. The display is marginally better in comparison to the 6S, but you can see the main difference at night, because the 8 Plus darkens more. In practice, only the iPhone X shows a qualitatively remarkable jump. Also, only on paper one has something of the higher performance. There were no applications for me on the 6S that would have been too slow and those that have jerked on the 6S are also jerking on the 8 Plus. That said, it's the programming of the app, not the performance. Support for wireless charging is certainly an advantage for those who use it. The necessary glass back makes it more sensitive to falls than the metal back of the 6S. Certainly one can argue about what is more aesthetic. If you use a bumper, you can only see the camera slits and tiny differences in the front of the speakers, whether it's a 6, 6S, 7 or 8. Anyway, better water protection is an advantage. I've used all the iPhones in the water so far and could avoid a water damage, but it is certainly not a mistake in case of the cases to be armed. Unfortunately, this water protection is at the expense of the headphone jack. Again, everyone likes to discuss individually who uses them, how much / uses them. In any case, it is one feature less and, in case of necessity, forces an adapter that does not actually improve the sound quality.The battery is smaller than the 6S. Due to the better processor efficiency this should be more than balanced. As far as the final version of iOS 11 is concerned, that is quite a comprehensible statement and even exceeds the runtime of the 6S. However, the thing has a taste. The iOS 11 beta release in early August was the best operating system version ever on the 6S in terms of energy efficiency. Even the optimized iOS 10 versions could not keep up with that. With each new version, the battery life of the 6S was reduced significantly, so that in the official iOS 11 version almost twice as often the 6S had to be loaded than a few weeks before. It's understandable, of course, that Apple is optimizing iOS 11 with a focus on iPhone 8 and X at the end and less on the old models, as I said, it has a connotation anyway. The biggest horse foot of the 8 Plus, however, is the GPS accuracy. In no iPhone / iPad before, the position was often displayed next to the road, even in the open air. It also does not help to reset the factory and switch the locale as it is sometimes generally suggested. I made a few direct comparisons out there with the 6S and iPad Air 2, and in almost all cases it was the 8 Plus that was the largest in Apple Maps' circle of inaccuracy. One point that I will address to the support, however, is found in forums to relatively many comparable entries in which repair and even device replacement have brought nothing and is spoken under the hand of a design problem. However, in terms of open support contact, this point is not included in the rating. What was and is for me personally the most important upgrade reasons is the increased main memory and the 256GB memory space that was not offered on the 6S model. Since this would have been technically possible, and was only offered for economic reasons, I forgive only one star. The higher internal memory speed and thus reduced upgrade / backup time is worth a second star in practice for me. The better water protection would be a star , he would not at the expense of Kopfhörerbuchse.Die slightly better camera is thwarted by the poorer image quality of the compression. One could discuss in total for 3 stars to award, which would probably be fair compared to smartphones from other manufacturers. On the other hand, the benchmark of my rating is the 6S. Purely by feel, the jump from 6S to 8 in practice is smaller than it was the 6S to 6. So I can not give a clear conscience 2 stars for such a smartphone in 2017, for the Apple requires more than 1000 euros. My recommendation to all 6S owners who manage with 128GB is one year to wait for the successor of the X. Since the teething problems are eliminated and you get a real added value for this money.	0

Unfortunately, I have to say that the disadvantages predominiegen.Mir is incomprehensible how to use the camera of the iPhone 7 even as a start as well or with those The competitions in the dark or at night have an extreme noise, which can not be mitigated by the very limited setting options. In addition, the extreme restrictions and restraints which one submits to the use of an Apple product, for someone who previously an Android device was used, a nuisance. Contacts from the phone book can only be sent to other users of Apple products. When talking on the phone heats up extremely over the entire side of the holding the smartphone, the use of the headset is highly recommended and saves Kopfschmerzen.Ich received the device as a business phone which is why I do not care about the extremely overpriced inappropriate price. No doubt there are also two positive points. The finish and feel is definitely unique in the market and great.2.

The amazon packaging appeared to be intact, while once the package was opened, the iPhone box was cellophane-free and empty inside. The cellular device was missing, the cables and everything else boasted in the description of the product. The package is - or maybe I should say ERA - sold and shipped by amazon. As written, I immediately called the call center, which told me that there was no ready and equivalent substitute. The package contained a gift for a degree, to be celebrated on Thursday. Currently the situation in which it is paid is the following: - inability to place a new order for the equivalent product without added costs - inability to order a substitute to the product without further disbursements - damage from delay in delivery - damage from non-gift (as Thursday I will have to present myself at the unloaded degree of this). I thank Amazon for the unpleasant inconvenience to which it has not been able to give prompt repair and solution. You have certainly lost a customer. The justification "to err is human" is not, at present, sufficient. I strongly believe that I am the victim of a scam. By reserving the right to proceed, it is not advisable to order this product. I am still waiting for the supervisor's call.	0

iPhone XR	128GB	Black	sirquickly	3	Great smartphone but too expensive for the price	2019-07-12	de	Much has been written about the XR - why add more mustard ...? For many years I was fixated on Apple; then the change to Android. And now? Still private Android and get as a company phone an XR. So much for the Ausgangslage.Entgegen some reviews, I think the display is good, could not fault it. Haptic, as usual from Apple more than very good. Camera good, but not more. Selfie camera phenomenal for the Face ID. It must be almost dark, that I have to type in the code. No jerks and the battery life is great. Everything runs great, no hangs in the apps, etc. Now comes, legitimately, the question: "" why forgive the deer only three stars in this song of praise? The XR is simply too expensive. Private I use a Redmi Note 7th The only point where the iPhone is the Chinese superior to the computer, is the processor performance. In direct comparison, the iPhone in the page layout ( same browser) significantly faster.And the rest? Yes, the Redmi has no inductive charging, no NFC ... .But the camera (with GoogleApp) is equivalent, haptics also, Gorilla Glass, Display .... At a cheaper by almost 600EUR price (respectively the 128gb version). If the XR somewhere at 500-600 EUR I would give 4.5 stars - so the selling price of the XR is simply too high.	0

iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Argent 	Nikola	4	If you need an iPhone, buy this and be sure	2019-01-23	it	I will briefly tell you about my experience with this iPhone, after having used it for more than 5 months ... consider that I had the jet black version. The battery being so voluminous lasts quite a while and you arrive at the end of the day without worries. Charging the battery is quite fast and in 1 hour and a half or 2 you can fully charge it. Great nice device from the aesthetic point of view but one thing I really have to say ... But making an oleophobic layer on the back too, doesn't it? With what it cost you could include it in the production process. It's up to you to hold the cover because it's pretty sensitive to scratch the back, but now you don't even do normal phones anymore, without one having to buy a cover. Turning to the front, the screen is really one of the best and not tired looking at it. The fingerprint sensor is really fast and lightning-fast, no criticism. The phone itself is lightning fast in the various operations, like every iPhone by the tronde. Excellent RAM management because it manages many apps in the background at the same time. GPS is the thing I love most about iPhones, because it takes very little to find the position and it is really very accurate. Very nice sound when you are listening to something from the phone, because both the speaker at the bottom and the one of the calls (front on the screen) act simultaneously, favoring a sound that is really pleasant, congratulations for this functionality to Apple. Instant and fast Bluetooth connection, as well as Wi-Fi. Easily hold various types of games without any lag, including Fortnite ... attention that can heat up on the back with prolonged use of the games. The camera is the thing I loved most about this phone, because it really makes unique photos ... it is the best camera-phone still in my opinion, not considering the current flagship devices (Iphone XS, XR). I believe that the camera in a device is very important, because we can capture important moments in our lives (I would avoid talking about selfies and 50 photos in a row made with a slice of bread or what we eat ... just take pictures of food), people must understand that the moments to be immortalized are very different. The first steps of our son, birthdays, moments spent together after so many years since you last saw each other with distant relatives, concerts ... in short, you have understood, things that will remain in history and our future offspring .... you want really leave photos of what you ate or your drunk photos to your children or grandchildren? I love the time of snapshots, why? You had to stand still as much as possible so as not to make a photo move, and you couldn't waste the cartridges .... firstly because they cost an eye. I know the temptation is strong but don't do it ... for god's sake. Having said that the iPhone 7 Plus is more than a great device and I definitely recommend buying it. Better this or an Android phone ?! I personally have tried several phones, but for a value for money, you will find it hard to find a better camera in a phone and that guarantees performances like those of the iPhone. Well if you want a better camera, I recommend: If you want to stay on an iPhone, take this, the 7 Plus. If you want to switch to Android, I recommend the Galaxy s9, or the OnePlus 6T ... too many, commas, suffice. But why remove the headphone jack? The excuse of space is not acceptable. Good luck in your decision.	0

iPhone XS Max	256GB	Space Gray	Malabulaba	1	Overvalued product with many disadvantages!	2019-01-26	de	For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Use only if the phone with the display is up on the table Warranty / Guarantee: The iPhone XS is indeed high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Apple gives on its products generally only 12 months Manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the price policy actually almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone from the top My assessment of a star refers exclusively to the criticism mentioned above.One note: I am willing to comment on factual comments, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and with criticism can not handle! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.	0

iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Marsupilami	2	Totally behind the competition. Viewpoints that drive you crazy - I give up!	2018-11-28	de	Autumn 2018. After my iPhone 6s, I had painfully switched to a Galaxy S8 (got the S8 for free). Terrible conversion from iOS to Android. And yes, even after about 5 weeks now I'm still cursing now and then on Android. A step back to the 6s was no longer possible; I was used to the big OLED display of the S8. However, after I really go off some iPhone features, I recently got myself an iPhone X 256m. Comparable surface S8 and X. Both from 2018 BJ. Both OLED from the house Samsung.- S8 has the sharper display. You can see it. Despite all the "" from xy ppi one sees no difference .. "" BUT! Looks man.- S8 has the harsher colors (I do not like myself, here is the iPhone better) - S8 has the sharper camera with the harsher colors (not realistic, but sharper and brighter) .- S8 with Android is customizable, iOS Static is always static. For this, iOS always and everywhere runs with all compatible devices (eg in the car, on the hi-fi system, etc.) - ... etc. In principle, there are nuances and thus differences to be forgiven. The reason why I still hand over the iPhone X.- Prices / Performance is subterraneous compared to the S8- The viewing angles are quite stable in S8, the iPhone X discolored with minimal movement, the display so strong that it annoys me animal (pictures, etc. are simply distorted by the "" handling "". Here, the "" Farbadjustment "" does not help, it is the Blickwinkel.Und before anyone asks ... I have sent it and (today) get the "" repaired "" Phone with a new display (Therefore, today the unnerved review. Finally, have my proof before and after the repair.) Minimal improvement, a few tiny degrees more are now in. It is not enough Here, the S8 is so much better, and only costs 1/3 of the iPhone X. both phones side by side and moves the devices synchronously, you can see quite quickly the difference. What brings me the "" better "" Color / Brightness / ... Appearance of the iPhone X when the colors / presentation in the "handling" of the phone so deteriorate that it annoys you?! Apple, maybe the end of 2019 or the end of 2020 again. If any.	0

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Edward Lynch	4	A little too big for comfort	2018-11-23	uk	I’ve had my iPhone XR a week now and I’m missing my iPhone 7!

iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Andreas	4	An almost perfect smartphone for technology enthusiasts	2017-11-21	de	Since unfortunately there are a lot of fake reviews written here or it is in part to no real reviews but rather I have pre-ordered my iPhone X on October 27 and received last week and could therefore make me a few days of it. The exact technical data, etc. can indeed be taken from the Apple page, so I would rather go into the actual user experience and show what I noticed in the everyday use positively or negatively. To the device: The smartphone itself is - as to this Price but also to be expected - absolutely immaculate and looks like a piece. Haptic makes it a high-quality impression, lies comfortably in the hand and has a nice size as I think. Only the protruding camera unit is a tiny drawback. The speakers provide very powerful and clear sound, the display is razor-sharp and really impressive due to its high contrasts and almost framelessness. The "" notch "", ie the indentation for the front camera or the sensors disturbs in everyday use not at all. Operation: The omission of Homebuttons brings so some peculiarities in the operation with it. Many functions are realized with new gestures, which quickly become flesh and blood. The commands are almost always well recognized and therefore the Missing Homebutton does not bother me at all. As a changeover from Android to iOS, I had to get used to the new operating system. This also worked very quickly, but I have to say there are a few details here and there, which I find suboptimal solved. For example, that the camera app offers no manual mode and also the few settings for the camera are not found in the app, but in the general settings.But the perfect operating system is not there anyway, even Android has its peculiarities. Who already uses an iPhone, will feel at home on the X immediately home. FaceID: The widely advertised new feature, namely the unlocking of the device by means of face recognition is unfortunately a double-edged sword and actually almost the biggest criticism for me. On the one hand, the face recognition works in most cases very reliable, even in complete darkness, on the other hand, such a fingerprint sensor but still faster and, above all, you can unlock the device already while you just pull it out of your pocket. In addition, you can unlock a device with fingerprint sensor times quickly, for example, if it is next to one on a table. With FaceID you have to take the phone each time in the hand and hold in front of the face. It is complaining at a high level, but the classic fingerprint sensor is my personal favorite. Finally, a few positive / negative aspects that I have noticed: + very beautiful, high-contrast and bright display + battery life for my needs more than adequate + cameras allow the layman beautiful and professional-looking shots + the new aspect ratio of Displays are particularly noticeable in websites with text positive, because here again just a few more lines fit + Inductive charging works comparatively fast and comfortable- Unfortunately, only a standard power supply included. Inductive charging station or fast charging section must be purchased separately. Weak performance at the price. - By arranging the keys, when I'm unlocking or invoking Siri I often happen to accidentally take a screenshot (the power key and the opposite volume key must be pressed at the same time) - Many apps are unfortunately not yet adapted to the aspect ratio and the extra space on the display is lost by black bars. The popular apps like Facebook, Whatsapp etc. but already use the full potential.- some gestures are often not recognized correctly or are more complicated to use than with a dedicated home or back button Conclusion: Overall, the new iPhone X is a successful Device that, as expected from Apple in the absolute upper class plays along. Compared to the iPhone 8, it is almost revolutionary, since the latter is almost only a mild development of the iPhone 7. This revolution can be paid well but Apple, the X is without question a luxury item and status symbol and especially for technology enthusiasts and Apple fans. If you would like to save a few hundred euros, you might want to look at the iPhone 8, which is virtually identical in terms of performance, but is much more conventional.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	michele di fronzo	5	For those who want to know EVERYTHING	2017-10-26	it	iPhone 8? Three things: charging, grip and sound from the speakers. Which are not really aspects of the smartphone, but features added to the macro-features that already exist: autonomous charging, design grip and multimedia audio. There would be a little drawing to do, so simple to explain. IPhone 8, nice but always the same design since 2015iPhone 8, beautiful but still the same design since 20151. Top-up (wireless) I put wireless charging first because it's the only feature I'm already missing. It seems stupid and of little use, but having a support base on which to instantly load your smartphone is not foolish. For the occasion, I bought a recharge base on Amazon for € 9.99, which I placed on my bedside table in the bedroom. I don't know if it makes sense to take this base on the road, because it would only be something more to carry that would not give a real added value, compared to the normal USB-Lightning cable. I noticed that, with a cable, the iPhone 8 recharges 100% in about 1 hour, and with wireless charging in just under 2, but with the latter method the glass body behind warms up considerably. If it heats up in this period that the outside temperature is at maximum 28 degrees, I can only imagine what could happen in the summer with 40 degrees and more. In any case, wireless charging is very useful, especially since Apple has decided not to create its own standard, but to use the Qi standard which is very widespread.Grip, better with the iPhone 8 backside, grip is better with the shell rear in iPhone 8 glass, the grip is better with the rear body in glass I am trying out iPhone 8 while I look at that frying pan of the iPhone 7 Plus that I bought last year and which now seems terribly inefficient in terms of size. It almost seems that today, after all these models of smartphones with FullVision displays, InfinityDisplay and so on and so forth, "going back" to a smartphone with even a few millimeters of edges is like being back in 2003. As I have already written in the Galaxy S8 review, iPhone 7 Plus looks ugly and old to me. iPhone 8 has the exact same form factor as its predecessor, yet the rear glass body removes a bit of bitterness in the mouth. It is not just a matter of appearance: iPhoneItalia dear Andrea Cervone recently released a video on Youtube which clearly shows that glass resists all kinds of falls, and only yields to absurd falls - like those from a balcony.iPhone 8 doesn't seem to break even if you kick it and hit it against a tree. Seeing is believing. I obviously haven't tried it. Last, but not least, is the audio: it seems that many producers have made up their minds to turn their laptop and smartphone into speakers, because even iPhone 8 earns a good percentage more decibels, if we can say so. The volume is higher than the previous ones and the Galaxy S8, and it's really clean. Yes, it could be a reason to switch to iPhone 8, but not for me for example. And then? IPhone 8 actually has changes under the shell. But they are not very relevant. There is the new A11 Bionic chip, which has a dedicated processor for machine learning (but now is of little use), there is also a renewed camera that takes photos and shoots videos 2% better than the iPhone 7. And on iPhone 8 Plus there is the dual camera with which you can use Portrait Lighting, a mode that acts in real time on the portrait and highlights it, or puts it in black and white, and so on. For now, though, they're all games, the real applications that can take advantage of the A11 Bionic chip are still work in progress. I have said that neither iPhone 8 nor iPhone X are the real news from Apple, because Apple's direction is on reality (increased) - even Valentino, in his article, delves into augmented reality and the iPhone. In short, iPhone 8 is a small step forward, because one step was necessary to do so. Of course, 50% of iPhone users are waiting for the iPhone X because it is the most expensive smartphone for consumers in history (I don't count special editions and luxury smartphones). So, in a nutshell: if you come from iPhone 6 or earlier, iPhone 8 will be a big step forward. Otherwise, go ahead: the revolution has yet to come.	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Black	M.K.	2	not the best phone I've ever had	2017-09-30	de	After years of using Samsung, I took the step in the direction of Apple and regret it in several points. Very poor reception no matter wlan, mobile data or normal Telefonienetz.Ich I switched from a Samsung S5 on the Iphone 7 and had directly bad reception. It did not get any better after replacing the sim card. With further searches on the Internet turned out that many people have the problem. What brings me a cell phone where the basic functions do not work? Optical and the operation really top but I live half in the country half in the city and have problems the network problems ( which I did not have before with the S5) Especially with a over 600 ¬ Handy the basic characteristics should work but unfortunately you do not.

iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Anonymiker	4	Lots of light - a little shade	2015-12-30	de	As a longtime Apple user, I would like to break no lance for or against Apple products, but especially on the improvements or deteriorations - compared to my previous device the iPhone 5 - go in: The strongest contrast is first in the larger phone - and the larger screen. One of my big worries was that fact: would the cell phone not be too big for me? ... I've heard from some people traveling around that they wanted to have their old device back at once. For me, exactly the opposite effect occurred: I had already grown in size after 5 minutes, that I was seriously considering whether the iPhone 6S + would not have been even better. Only rarely do you get to a corner not as well off as in the past - but what you gain for additional vision makes up for the 10x. Here's a very big PLUS. The next big thing is the fingerprint scanner. Of course all those who have an iPhone 5S or newer already know that - but for me it was a big news. Unfortunately, it is not quite mature yet. I used to work classically with the message center. Say: the first push of a button showed me the time - with the second wipe I was in the message center. Today I can hardly avoid that I am automatically logged on ... and (and then you realize then that the phone has got bigger) to wipe from top to bottom, you have to stretch his hand already uncomfortable. In addition - and this is also a small disadvantage - I need now longer to get into the camera mode, because always only the registration takes place. Thus I miss the one or the other nice snapshot :-( But - and I find that considerable - the iPhone 6S keeps longer with the battery than my iPhone 5 although it has a larger display, many more sensors and also constantly scanning my fingerprint .Eas ugly I think the on / off button to the side to lay in. Sure - you get better off ... BUT: if you want to take a screenshot (and I do that more often) then you get very often in parallel to the volume buttons - and that prevents the screenshot.Last small defect - of which I do not know if it is only on my device or at all: the sockets for the charging cable and the headphones are a bit sharp Sensitive as far as my fingers are concerned - but I'm used to something else from Apple in this regard, and I suspect that it's because all the edges on the iPhone 6S are rounded - this keeps the fingers from touching If I find that this "" error "" only on my device is present, I will add this here.	0

iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	tactless (no tact)	5	Amazing!	2017-11-12	uk	• BLACKS: blacks look properly black. Unlike LCD, they don't even light up the pixel.• HOME BUTTON GONE: you have to swipe up instead. I like this because it goes straight to the home screen, because while you're doing it, Face ID unlocks the phone in the background.• TO SWITCH APPS: just keep your finger on the screen after you swipe up. You get a subtle haptic feedback and then you get the apps presented to you as ""cards"".• NOTCH: It's actually tiny, and you really do stop noticing it.• CAMERA: optical stabilisation now also works on the telephone lens. It's superb.Overall, the phone is such a delight, you overlook the minor shortcomings:• COLOUR SHIFT: the whites seem blue-ish when you tilt the phone a bit. (Very slightly.)For people who are stuck in their ways: just get the iPhone 8. It has almost the same technology and you get to keep the home button. The iPhone 8 is still a great phone!• PRICE: It's very nice but i feel it's overpriced at £999 [Do not pay over £999 for the base model! I note that on this page they are taking the piss!]UPDATE 2018.05.02================• FaceID is a nice effort, but in my opinion nothing beats Touch ID 2 (as found on the iPhone 6 / 7/ 8).• I get that there's no room for Apple to put the TouchID sensor, due to reduced bezels.• It's annoying that the gestures are not now consistent between iPhone X vs iPad (& iPhone 7/8/SE)	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Pusheen	4	Apple Iphone 8 - detailed review	2018-02-05	de	Welcome to my review of the Iphone 8 from Apple. As a small warning to those who do not want to read a detailed review -> to the conclusion scroll. Foreword: ------------------------------ -------------- I do not own an Iphone 8, I could test it extensively only within the family for a week. I was a long time owner of an Iphone 6s and would like to compare a bit to this. Technical data 4.7 inches with 750 x 1,334 pixelsProcessor: Apple A11 Bionic (Hexa-Core) 64 GB memory (depending on version, approx. 51 GB available, not expandable) Camera 1.8 operating system 1,821 mAh (iFixit value) Design and processing: --- ----------------------------------------- The design has not much to the Iphone 6s done on the front, there are always the same bars, both above and below. On the back, but has changed a lot, the aluminum that extended at 6s over the entire back, was now limited to the edges and replaced with glass .The logo was embedded in the glass and can no longer be felt , the transition from the aluminum frame to the glass surface is perfect, the only difference you can tell is the temperature difference. The only negative point here, which has already bothered me in the Iphone 6s, the camera protrudes on the housing out. The processing of the iPhone 8 shows At the highest level, as has been the tradition at Apple for years. No burr or gap disturbs the haptic. The processing of the device is as always at the highest level, the design can be up to the glass back after so many generations to be desired ... for this 4.5 / 5 stars.Display: - ------------------------------------------- The Iphone 8 has a 4, 7 inches display with a resolution of 750x1334 pixels, a similar or even the same was installed in the Iphone 6s, but that is by no means negative. The sharpness leaves nothing to be desired and the secondary services convince as already familiar from the previous models. Thus, the readability in flat plan view is excellent and the colors and sharpness remains stable when turning in front of the eye for a very long time. The 3D touch function was already at 6s, here it is even more mature, it can, for example, even before opening Once you get used to the function, it accelerates the use of some apps and the access, for example, to the settings a lot. Unfortunately, there is nothing new from the display, everything was somehow available in older models ... so it is not bad ... I give 4.5 / 5 Sterne.Ausstattung and performance: -------------------- ------------------------ In the Iphone 8 is an A11 Bionic chip installed which should work much more efficient than its predecessors, but is that true? Yes, the computing power is bombastic, the Iphone 6s had a good performance, this is where the Iphone 8 again Apple has equipped the Hexa core chip with two high-performance cores and four lower-clocked cores that consume less power. The control of the smartphone is always very fluent and parallel operation as well as complex apps and applications are very quickly executed or operated .Heating the Iphone 8 is noticeable, but is still far from overheating. The performance of the Iphone 8 is bombastic, here Apple has again done first-class work, as it is already used by Apple. Here you can only 5/5 Awarded star.Telephone and call quality: -------------------------------------------- The main task of a mobile phone is, as you can imagine, the phone calls. This succeeds with the Apple iPhone 8 also great, which was not surprising and was to be expected. The sound quality is at a good level. Talks conducted on the ear sound clear, are loud enough on both sides, and can be conducted without delays. When handsfree mode is used, it becomes clear that the loudspeaker can not quite keep up with the rest of the sound quality. At moderate volume, there's nothing to complain about, but turn the knob up and overdrive the speaker over and over again. Nevertheless, the performance in this area is absolutely sufficient. Here I give 4.5 / 5 Sterne.Kamera: --------------------------- ----------------- The 12 megapixel camera makes very good pictures, here there is also, as with its predecessors, nothing to complain about. Nevertheless, the setting options leave something to be desired, No portrait effects, zooms or similar. Other smartphones in this price range already offer dual cameras with far more functionality. Even with selfies, there are not really features to optimize the images, neither filters nor cosmetics settings. Unfortunately, the evolution of the camera since the Iphone 6s somewhat faltering, the camera is for me the biggest negative point of the Iphone 8, this makes other providers much better. For this I give 4/5 Sterne.Software and multimedia: -------------------------------------- ------ Equipped with the new operating system iOS 11, there were some innovations on the Apple front, that control center was completely redesigned, the notification area was summarized with the lock screen and a darker hue was also missed the operating system. Who likes screenshots iOS 11 can be updated with new editing tools, which also make handwritten annotations on screenshots easy. The function "" outsource apps "" should make full iPhone memory the end.The system will simply delete unused apps, or offload them to the cloud. In the process, personal data and settings are retained and are available for reinstallation as if nothing had happened. Thus, the question when buying "" What memory size do I have to grow? "" The voice quality of Siri was in contrast to the 6s It's now also possible to chat with the language assistant. Apple has not set a milestone with iOS11 or reinvented the wheel, everything is running smoothly and harmoniously. For this I give 4.5 / 5 Sterne.Akku: -------------------------------------- ------ In my battery test, which I have done with the iPhone 6s so I come to the following figures in the 24-hour test 52% - After another 16 hours in standby: 37% It can be said, after 8 hours intensive use (videos, whatsapp, telephony, etc.), the battery stood still 52%. The remaining 16 hours spent the device in standby mode and went after 24 hours with 37% battery from the test, this is not bad, but also not outstanding ... it may well be that you have to insert a "pit stop" on the charging cable during intensive use. For this I give 4/5 stars. Conclusion 4,5 / 5Display: 4,5 / 5Ausstattung und Leistung: 5 / 5Phone and call quality: 4.5 / 5Camera: 4 / 5Software and Multimedia: 4.5 / 5Total: 4 / 5The Apple iPhone 8 is no bad phone. With the fast computer, the unique selling point iOS and the outstanding workmanship as well as a simple and never hooking user feeling it brings the classical strengths Apple with itself. But one thing Apple has set for the iPhone 8: the pursuit of "" one more thing "" or less cluttered, the urge for innovation. Compared to the Iphone 6s everything seems somehow known and "" old "", it is called "" Never Change a running system "", but a fresh wind at Apple would not hurt me. Nevertheless, I can give a buy recommendation here! I hope my review could help you.	0

All that's this phone does is freeze, turn off and won't come back on after. And when It eventually comes back on after it turning itself off, it takes ages to come back on.

iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Grey	James	1	Beautiful phone with rubbish software	2017-06-23	uk	I got this phone as a free upgrade and it lasted 4 days before I sent it back. First thing I did was upgrade to iOS 10.3. I work on the road and my phone is everything. I installed hear maps which I always used on my s5. Voice navigation did not work. Installed Google maps, voice navigation worked for 30 minutes and only when I was on the exact route. Set a course for London from Ipswich it completely failed. Notifications had no sounds most of the time. I tried calling my provider and selecting the options on the ivr , selecting the numbers on the phone did nothing. Getting an s7 now. Like buying an Alfa, blinded by beauty but rubbish reliability under the bonnet. Never again.	0
iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	Matthew	2	I love Apple but hate this iPhone model	2018-11-04	us	I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6, which I had no issues with at all, other than it being antiquated. In fact, I loved the phone and all of the features. I'll make this review easy by simply listing the pros and cons.Pros:-Waterproof (allegedly)-Larger screen and better graphics-Better camera quality than ever beforeCons:-Insanely expensive-Facial recognition is not that great. It works about 70% of the time and doesn't work randomly, for unknown reasons-The processor is supposed to be faster but it is constantly lagging when using apps and I'm nowhere close to capacity-With the home button gone, you have to swipe up from the bottom to close apps. This is problematic when using certain apps because I often inadvertently swipe up (when playing a game, for instance) and close the app-The battery life is supposed to be better than previous models, however I don't notice a difference. The phone also takes a bit longer to fully charge	0

iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	ohlen	4	apple enters new territory: face id!	2017-12-10	de	google the eu program INDECT. apple is an organ for monitoring humanity - just like google or facebook. face id should not make it easier for you to save your contact list from unauthorized access by third, this would be enough for a pin. it's about capturing your biometric data and identifying it clearly everywhere in the future. when shopping, on the ground - wherever cameras are installed, to which secret services have access thanks to software backdoors. did you never think of that in spite of snowden? Look at what is done with whistleblowers à la assange, manning or snowden and how to deal with a mister bush or a cheney in return. You remember, the lies that led to the Iraq war. interesting keywords: indect, utah data center, american hit man, operation northwoods. If one deals with the Kennedy assassination or with his warnings of a shadow government, his speech a few days before his execution, one may at least fear that the "West", as we supposedly knew it, could be an illusion it's about surveillance. and your prestigious award is now the near-perfect tool to help us destroy our freedom. open your mind and think about it. says no and ends the spook. why do I rate the device with four stars? so that those who read the review that are as excited about apple as I used to be today are reading it. I hope my review encourages one or the other to rethink: think different!	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	S. Monster	4	High-quality smartphone with top workmanship but at a very high price	2016-03-08	de	Good: processing, software, camera, app offer, smooth operationGar not good: memory not expandable, no Full HD display, camera stands out easily, "" Price ""; -Deffernt one the protective film of the iPhone one notices immediately that Apple on metal housing sets. The material looks very high quality and feels in the hand accordingly. There is nothing wrong with the processing. The front with the display seamlessly sets up without any disruptive edges where the case ends. The side buttons, the home button and the connections for the headphones and the charging cable are also well incorporated, sit firmly and provide a very good pressure point. Although the camera is also outstanding incorporated, but it stands out a little from the case. When you place it on a table, the iPhone is thus not completely flat and shakes in the operation. First, the SIM card is inserted with the associated tool. When starting the device you will be guided in some steps by menu through the initial setup. A few minutes later, the iPhone is ready for use. The software is designed intuitively, whereby the operation opens up quite quickly, almost immediately. Pre-installed are numerous apps from Apple. These can be if they are not needed or wanted to be uninstalled for the most part, but which is the case with other manufacturers as well and must therefore be denounced equally by all manufacturers and not just Apple. The battery is used relatively often in the relatively fast Knee. Charging takes about as long (or as short) as for devices from other manufacturers. Unfortunately, the battery is unfortunately not interchangeable. However, there are accessories with a built-in additional battery. The display is just a Retina HD display. Unfortunately, this does not solve with Full HD, which without direct comparison, however, neither spectacularly noticeable nor disturbs. All in all, the display is satisfactory. The quality of the recordings is very good. The flash works as it should. Video recordings are possible in 4K, but this takes up a lot of memory due to the file size. So it is advisable to do without it if possible, except you can immediately copy the material to another device. The front camera is still satisfactory in terms of quality. Here, a kind flash can be used by the display (the display lights up very bright white), but there is not necessarily significant differences, unless you are photographing something in almost total darkness. The speakers are quite okay so far. The sound is overall satisfactory. The included Apple EarPods but I would advise to exchange with better sound sources - but everyone likes how you personally like it better. The network reception is good everywhere, even better than with other devices. The connection is made quickly and the call quality is very good. Just like the network, the Internet works well. Especially the WLAN connection is convincing and is much better than many other smartphones. Surfing and operating apps is of course more fun with relatively short load times. GPS works fast and accurate.The same applies to a stable Bluetooth connection and transmission. Apple offers the iPhone 6S in 3 memory sizes. At 16GB you should quickly reach the capacity limit. The memory is unfortunately not expandable, which is more or less forced to buy a device with a larger memory when the capacity limit is reached. Therefore, I would like to recommend 64GB, these should be sufficient for a while in normal use. Special Features: Siri has been on iPhones for a while. Siri is ready to use and delivers good results. The recognition rate is pleasingly high, so that the voice assistant usually understands what he wants the first time and does it immediately (if enabled, Siri listens immediately, without the need for a start, then it can be done without the iPhone Take, for example, set an alarm clock or timer, announce the weather for tomorrow or pass the current football results, which is useful, for example, when driving a car). Also, the fingerprint sensor is not only since the iPhone 6S. This was improved again and works very well and fast. A short hang up is enough to unlock the iPhone (some apps use this feature). 3D Touch is an innovation. The display recognizes how tight you are and reacts accordingly. Pressing strongly opens a menu on some apps that can then be used to directly access certain features (such as writing an e-mail immediately, without having to go into the app). Also, e.g. when pressing firmly on links a preview of the desired website will be loaded. Live Photo takes a picture 1.5 seconds before and after being triggered. This can be animate when you press on a picture. Apple has some special features that are all very well integrated and can also be very useful. Each individual can be activated or deactivated, so you are not forced to use them. For example, if you have a problem with Siri always running in the background, you can disable this option and use Siri in the usual way. Conclusion If you compare price and performance, I find the price a bit high. For this one receives however a TOP processed and high-quality Smartphone. There are almost no criticisms, and those that exist must be blamed on many other manufacturers as well. Only the lack of memory expansion and the protruding camera are particularly noteworthy and also that the display does not offer Full HD resolution. That would be more than adequate at such a high price. Apart from that, but it makes quite a lot of fun, with the iPhone around fantigen.Wegen the missing full-HD and the mentioned negligence, but I have to deduct a star, because all this would be at this high price or simply not there But you have to seriously ask the question whether the designer might have thought of anything, or whether he was only sleeping at the time, while the apprentices are busy went unchecked to the work after the motto: "" Oh easy, will not notice "").	0

The new Mac High Sierra and IOS 11 operating systems for itune and iphone are real viruses for your devices over 2 years old! In addition, Apple Care is recruiting a team that has no technical skills to help you solve your problems. problems and will not offer you especially any commercial solution! "" Normal "" will you say, this is precisely their new branding strategy! The planned obsolescence of Apple products is a reality that I have refused to see until it impacts me directly. I am writing this post to prevent others from throwing their money out the window . I have an iphone 6 plus a Mac Book Air and a Super Drive (external DVD player). I had 2 weeks ago the unfortunate act of updating my iphone which worked perfectly on IOS 10 to IOS 11.2.5. Since my phone is less responsive than the one I owned 10 years ago. The applications take looooooooooyear seconds to open, take a photo quickly is impossible, sent a message remains possible if you are not disturbed by the fact that it appears only after you have typed 10 Phrases.I contact the assistance Apple (the story is abbreviated because it took me 9 calls of 2h including 1h systematic waiting, spread over 2 weeks, to obtain the poor result that I will describe you): The assistance tells me to restore my iphone to fix the problems. To do this, an update of itune is necessary, but in order to achieve the update of itune I must first update the operating system of my Mac because none of the sytems were compatible between them. I'm running (with you imagine it much trouble because nothing works as indicated by employees of Apple). After several nights of updates, my iphone is finally restored and all my systems are up to date. ... Finding: My iphone is still slow and my Mac on the latest version High Sierra no longer recognizes my Super Drive (which can not be updated) .I spend my last night on the phone with Apple who does not offers no solution and hangs up leaving me in total disarray (I forgot to mention that my interlocutors have all tried to charge me their package of assistance for products no longer under warranty). To conclude, Si you do not want to spend 800 to 2500 euros for a phone or computer every two years and buy accessories at an exorbitant price that become obsolete after 6 months ... FUY !!!!!! Any other smartphone provider is doing better than Apple now! Apple, I hope this post will continue to complete your reputation so that others do not get caught up in your vast scam. The only time I will lose with you now will be the one I need to propagate this message as widely as possible.KindlyAn ex-consumer.	0

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Sportydriver	4	My first iPhone and only trouble	2017-10-25	de	After being an Android user for many years, I decided to give Apple a try because I did not want Android on the "" crafting system "". In the hope of a stable, mature operating system along with the iPhone 8 Plus, I'm rather disappointed after a week. Sure, iOS has some advantages, such as fast apps. I did not know anything like that before. On the Internet in no time, there is really joy auf.Aber unfortunately, there are still many construction sites, which are largely due to a very poor operating system: - Even recorded photos (no live images) are in a folder with WhatsApp images, etc. in one Folders are packed and can not be stored separately in a separate folder. A separate folder for portraits, for live images and even one for WhatsApp. Only the "" normal "" images come in a collection folder. What a nonsense !!! - Image information of recordings, such as creation date and time does not exist. Only if one loads the pictures on the PC, one can call this information. - Which I also instead, my email accounts can not be updated regularly with the email app. I can do what I want. It does not work. Only another email app helped. Apple! - Today tried to pull pictures from the iPhone to the Windows PC. The copying by explorer still worked. But then I noticed that the images are saved in a format called HEIC and can not be opened with anything. So called the hotline and first bumped into perplexity. HEIC said nothing to the employee. After a long wait the solution was found. There is a setting where you can change the whole thing so that JPEG are saved. What a drama! - Sending and receiving images via Bluetooth is of course not possible. Now some will scream again that you know something like that before and you can inform yourself. I did not know and thought 2017 is something as natural as Android has been possible for many, many years.- If you go under settings - battery then you jump somehow constantly while scrolling back and forth. You can then choose between consumption of the last 24 hours and 3, 4 or 5 days what appears there to choose is apparently a matter of luck. Time is 3 days, times 5, times 4. What is this nonsense? - Connect to iTunes? No problem, but apart from advertising, advertising and advertising again, it seems to be completely pointless. I've spent 2 days trying to load images into any clouds and automatically sync them. I'm too stupid for that or I'm smart. Unlocking iTouch works very well, except for the fact that you sporadically land on the lock screen and I'm told to press the button again. 10 times the home screen opens directly and then again, although the device was unlocked. It's annoying - well, then at least it will work with navigation. So today on the way the Navi started by Siri and entered destination. Wonderful, the Navi starts its service and shows me the route. But something is missing. Right, no speech! No matter what I tried, it was silent. Certainly, the phone is smarter than me here.- Two times it has already happened that I could unlock the phone on an incoming message, which was seen as a banner on the lock screen, by simply wiping the banner to the right. No Touch ID required !!! If you call Android as a craft OS, should try out the new iPhone 8 Plus. Update 01.11.2017einige problems have done in the meantime.- So the email accounts now work without problems.- image information is actually displayed (sorry , my mistake) .- Touch ID works now also, thanks to an additional setting (hidden in the menu) reliable.- the iCloud works after a long time back and forth, now also remain so far the strange photo folder, where all pictures land and one is forced Moving your own recordings into separate albums and the lack of ability to send / receive files like photos via Bluetooth (to Android) Therefore now 4 instead of 3 stars.	0

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	ein kunde aus düsseldorf	3	I was forced	2019-06-01	de	As a long-time satisfied user of Asian budget smartphones, I was forced by my employer to buy this device due to "changed mobile standards". Dual SIM had to be on hold. Compared to my last cell phone, an almost historic Honor 4x, the much better Kamara and the very fluently running software stand out positively. Negative is the fairly high weight and - for me serious - miserable dictation function. Professionally, I am forced to dictate extensive texts in the worst specialist gibberish, which was not a problem at all with the Honor - and a Samsung Tablet used for comparison - quasi out of box. Unfortunately, the expensive iPhone only produces absolute garbage. Everyday language, of course also garnished with elements from the consumer and media world, runs great. At the moment I'm hoping for the system's ability to learn, but I'm skeptical.	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Gray	Massimo e Katia	5	"Almost perfect!	2018-10-17	it	Let's take a quick look at the main strengths and weaknesses of this phone, the latest from Apple, without paying too much attention to cold numbers but, above all, to everyday use. Let's start with what I didn't like: - Weight. Yeah, the history of the rear glass to allow wireless charging has increased the bulk and you can hear it in your pocket, even in your hand it doesn't go unnoticed, but you get used to it.-The camera has a protruding traffic light. Bruttina to see makes the dancer device if placed flat on the back.-The "Notch 1". Staying on the cleat is invasive, especially if you watch videos or if the apps are not optimized, then off that portion of the display and many greetings to the big screen. - The "Notch 2". And here we go again! The diabolical black stripe that still combines us? Reduces the space for system icons in the upper part ... do you want to see the battery percentage, if the bt is on, if a vpn is active, the name of the operator, etc.? Well, every once in a while you will have to pull down the drop-down menu, the one for the "quick" settings to understand. She looks stupid, but in everyday use it's a nice break! Bad! -The remaining battery percentage. I know, I repeat, excuse me! But what the hell did it take to insert it inside the special icon? Bah! - The battery. Ok, who has had an iPhone is used to it, with intense use you don't get there in the evening, you know. But the story that on the new Iphone lasts the most is stupid. The screen oled sucks, even if there was a difference you wouldn't even notice ...- Siri. Nothing ... despite the shortcuts we are still light years away from the Google assistant. - Le animoji and the memoji. Now, with all due respect ... but what really? Or are you a 6 year old child or what would be the utility? Make you pass for a fool even during messages and video calls? What then at least save us the presentations of the river of ste ca ... stupid! -The processor. An exaggerated power even for a PC. But what are you doing with cell phones ??? If you don't plan to design Dubai's next mall or walk around like zombies for VR games, all power is absolutely useless. Marketing, point. The average user of the "very good" on Facebook and the photo of the cutlet on Instagram what should you do with it?.If you hear a crack and you hope it is the knee rather than the phone, obviously, there is a problem! -It is not 5g. Here too ... Apple we know ... of course they could have been wasted for once. Instead, guess what? No predisposition for the 5g that should arrive in 2020 in Italy. And in two years if you want to use the new band, ooops, it's up to upgrade to the new model. - The physical keys. Now the power button calls up Siri, to turn off the phone you have to simultaneously press the minus volume key and the power key, for the screenshots plus volume key and power key. Uncomfortable. - No lightning adapter / headphone jack in the package. If you want it, you pay for it separately, as does the quick charger. Tirchioni! -Do not justify the upgrade from X, few novelties and not unavoidableWhat I liked: -The processor. I know, I contradict myself, but hell! It's a splinter! Fluid, never a lag, never an uncertainty, never a delay. Smooth! -The display. The oled is a show, in any light condition it is a show. -The sound is actually improved.-The Face-Id is infallible and very fast, even with sunglasses zero problems. He even recognizes me as soon as I wake up, ok then he turns to the other side disgusted, but the phone unlocks him anyway. - The camera. Even if you are not a professional, in any lighting conditions you will always get impeccable results. - Cell phone reception, data, bt and wifi. Perfect, nothing to say.-Build quality. It is an iPhone and you can hear it! - Hardware / software integration always on top. - It is a reliable and simple travel companion in its daily use, you will never have to make too many slamming to keep it in perfect shape. - The Apple ecosystem, closed but at the same time so reassuring, and continuous updates.-The quality of the App.-It may seem silly but ... everything works fine! Certainly there are some defects, I have listed them above, but believe me, once you have this little concentration of technology in your hand, they will be overshadowed. If there are economic possibilities and you are not fond of push customization this is a phone exceptional.If you want to ask a few questions use also the appropriate function of Amazon, I will be happy to help you.	0

I have not heard from anyone since it was return June 1, 2019, even the tracking information is f-ed up. So yeah if you want a phone that will work please just go to Apple it will be worth it trust me	0
iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Gold	Silvia	4	Excellent evolution of the previous models, but at what price! (eye that the model in the photo is the iphone 7 "" smooth "")	2016-10-01	it	PREMISE September also arrived this year, and with autumn comes, as usual, the new iPhone. However, this year's novelty is not the new iPhone itself, but rather Apple's abandonment of the habit of updating stylistically the phone is now two years old, limiting itself to restyling in the intermediate years, whose name is the same as that of the previous model, with the addition of an "" S "". Iphone 7, in spite of the name, is basically an iPhone "" 6S "" s, that is the model of last year, with an extra "S". I don't say that the news is missing, it's simply not the new model that many waited, why is this happening? Because many now buy iPhone with 30/36 month contracts, so Apple is adapting to this, allowing its customers to have a new model every time a telephone contract ends (signing a new one). Or, as someone thinks, Apple is a little short of ideas or news that can be concretely realized and sold. The review of a product like iPhone 7 will not be short, but I have tried to make it into sections, so that everyone can read or skip the different parts, according to one's own interest. But let's start with the actual review. PACKAGINGThe box is made with the usual sturdy cardboard, typical of Apple products, and has about the size of the phone, or 9.6 x 17.5 x 4.8 cm, and presents, on the front, a photo of the phone seen from the back, naturally with the color of the iPhoine contained. Sideways the iPhone and the apple writing, always in the color of the phone and transparencies, while on the back we find the model codes, capacity and a text in different languages ​​(including Italian), which indicates the contents of the package and the requirements for the operation of our iPhone.Inside, the phone, protected with a plastic film to be removed, a small cardboard container inside which we find two stickers of the apple, the paper clip to insert the sim, and a few sheets, which explain how start using the phone. Under the small power supply with USB output, the USB-lightning cable to connect the phone to your PC / Mac or to the power supply, the headphones, which now no longer have the classic jack that we all know, but the proprietary apple connector called lightning, and an adapter, to connect our old headphones with jack socket to the lightning port of the phone. Note, that the new headphones have lost the rigid box that kept the old earpods, and so now we will find ourselves with loose headphones in the bag (or in the desk), which in addition to being unpleasant in itself, risks causing the headphones to be damaged prematurely. Fortunately, if you have an old pair of earpods, you can retrieve the plastic box, putting the new headphones in place of the previous ones, thus guaranteeing headphone safety and order. The power supply should be the 5W A1400 model. I say "" should "", because the technical characteristics are printed in medium gray on a light gray background, and are very small, so it is almost impossible to read the model or the electrical characteristics. I do not agree with this choice, because I believe it is my right to know what I buy, and to be able to buy an equivalent product elsewhere. Note that even on the box or on the site, these features are present. PHONE We ​​insert the sim, as with previous models, and turn on the phone. While starting up, a quick glance outside: at the front it is indistinguishable from previous models, with the 5.5 "" screen, the touch id with a ring matching the shell, the camera for selfy, the light sensor environmental and the loudspeaker used in call and for the speakerphone. Turning it, we find the Apple crest, which is shiny and reflective like a mirror, the iPhone writing, a few initials, the camera, and a small microphone.The camera will be double and protruding, accompanied by a bi-color LED, positioned as usual in the upper left corner. At the upper and lower edges, the two classic lines, white in my case, but whose color depends on the color of the phone's body, which serve to guarantee the functioning of the telephone and data transmission parts. It must be said, that not even 10 days after the purchase, and with the phone always in a case, the white lines already tend to get dirty, and they do not seem very easy to clean. At the top there is nothing, on the right side the button of switching on the trolley to insert the SIM (all strictly in the same color as the shock), and the two lines also on the back. On the opposite side, the volume keys, and the selector to mute the phone, even here all in the same color as the body. Below, the lightning connector for charging or connecting accessories, and two side grids, which contain the microphone for phone calls, a speakerphone speakerphone, and probably some other sensor. Ignition is fast enough, and after about 26 seconds the phone will be operational. The display is very clear, because it boasts a full HD resolution, which is the same as on many 40 "" televisions, giving a feeling of glossy material on which the fingers slide well, and is sensitive to pressure. In practice, placing your finger on the screen, for example in correspondence of an icon, we will see the background blur as we press. The more intense the pressure, the more blurred the background will appear, and vice versa. But the purpose of this sensitivity, of course, is another. With a slight pressure (actually not always easy to get), we will enter the mode that allows us to move the icons or delete some installed program, while a more determined pressure (but always without exaggeration), will give access to new functions, like the preview of the selected mail, the opening of a contextual menu that resembles that of windows that opens with the right mouse button, and many other functions that depend on the single application. The fingerprint reader is very fast, but not is based more on a physical key. Like the display, it is a pressure sensitive surface, also equipped with a small motor, which vibrates, removes the finger, and conveys a sensation similar to the old physical key. For the first uses, it will seem strange to you, inhabited by the previous keys, but after a few hours you will no longer notice the difference. The problem, if anything, will be that being a "" key "managed by the operating system and not physical, in case of problems with some program, you risk not being able to count on the only button of the iPhone, which in the past allowed us to close a frozen app. Of course, with the phone switched off, try pressing the button, it will give the same feeling as pressing on the display: nothing happens. The battery will allow one to three days without charging: today, for example, in 13 standby, with wi -fi and Bluetooth always on, very limited use (some WhatsApp and mail control in push, but no call), the phone has consumed less than 25% of battery. Surely in areas with weak signal, or with a more intense use the battery it will download faster, but the iPhone Plus has always allowed me to arrive at night without problems. Personally the back without the lines and with the dual camera of the 7 plus model seems to me a bit "heavy", and does not convince me completely, but maybe you just have to get used to it.The lines of the previous 6s, broke a little, making the phone appear less "" a brick "", especially on light colors. Here, however, these are subjective evaluations, so everyone decides according to their own sensations and tastes. The dimensions are important (about 7.8 x 15.8 x 0.8 cm), but the phone holds well in hand, even if after long phone calls, you may feel your fingers annoyed, due to the large size and limited thickness. Unable to write using the phone with one hand, as was the case with iPhone 6 Plus and 6S Plus, because you will not get to the leftmost keys of the keyboard (for example the "" key "), and I recommend a cover, that makes the bottom of the phone less slippery, because it's shiny. If you find all the models, colors and materials: with less than 10 euros you will find excellent covers, made by specialized companies, and you can get cover for tens or hundreds of euros, for those who just can't be satisfied.The phone, finally, it is classified IP67, therefore it resists to water splashes. It does not mean that you can immerse it in water without risk, because Apple will not replace a failed phone due to water entry for free, but if the phone should unfortunately fall into the pool, the chances of damage will be reduced. For the chronicle, InternationProtection67 means: "" equipped with a casing totally protected against dust (and against access with a wire) and protected against the effects of the dive "". In any case, it is a beautiful phone, which will hardly pass unnoticed, especially if inserted in a transparent cover. TELEPHONE PARTY When passing from an iPhone 6 Plus to this one, I had the clear feeling that the telephone was receiving less. In several places where before I had signal, however weak, iPhone 7 plus clearly says "" no signal "". I don't have the possibility to make measurements, because I sold my previous phone, but so it is. It also happened to me, in a couple of phone calls, that I couldn't hear the other person. The feeling was that of a speaker covered with tinfoil, which attenuates the voice, alters it and makes the speech incomprehensible. I had no problems with hands-free car or headset systems, as much as I may have tried them in a few days. When there were no problems I mentioned, the car on call was clear and, always with good volume. No problem with wi-fi or bluetooth connections. Missing nfc.FOTOCAMERA Even if the camera is protruding and less "beautiful" aesthetically than the previous models, the pictures taken are not bad at all. The phone has two cameras, one for "" normal "" photos, and one for "" zomm 2x "" photo mode, again without software interventions.For those who are not satisfied, the operating system allows digital enlargements (ie with loss of quality, just to be clear), up to 10x. The colors appear saturated and the colors are very pleasant. Present the optical stabilizer to reduce the risk of blurred photos, and the usual "" moviola "" and "" time-lapse "" modes, which will give us slow-motion or accelerated videos, but which will require support for the phone, so to have stable resumptions. Other effects will soon arrive, such as the blurred background, which will allow us to take even more beautiful pictures. Automatically, unless you turn it off, the photos will be taken in live mode. What does it mean? That the phone will take the picture, but it will also take a video of a few seconds, and pressing the display when the photo is displayed, you will be able to see the movie. Pleasant in some situations, it is completely useless in most cases. Imagine a picture of a building, and imagine what will happen if you watch the video: you will see passers-by moving, and the scene wobbling, if you took the picture hands-free. Powerful rear flash, which now relies on 4 LEDs, of two different colors, in order to illuminate the different scenes, without altering (too much) the colors of the subjects photographed. The focal length is equal to f / 1.8 for the normal camera, and f / 2.8 for that relative to the 2x zoom. This means beautiful photos in classic mode, and darker photos using the zoom (but they will also darken when recording slow motion video). The 12 megapixels of each sensor, allow detailed photos in all situations, although it should be remembered that given the size of the sensor, you will not have to expect photos similar to those obtainable with an SLR, perhaps associated with lenses that cost themselves as much as a iPhone 7. Wanting to make a comparison with the most famous competitor, the Galaxy S7 edge, I would say that as the quality of the photos we are at the same (excellent) levels, even if the samsung phone has a focal aperture of f / 1.7 (so it makes sharper and clearer photos in low light conditions), but a less powerful flash, and a single sensor. AUDIO Another novelty of this model is stereo audio. In practice, activating the speakerphone, the audio will be produced both from the loudspeaker at the bottom, near the lightning connector, and from the loudspeaker that we normally use to call, that is the one positioned above the display. The feeling is of a good volume (not very strong, but sufficient), coming mainly from the speaker at the bottom. The bass is there, although it is possible to reproduce it with such small speakers, so listening is pleasant for all types of music. With headphones, the sound improves and the volume is naturally higher. Absent, as per the historical apple policy, the possibility to set one's own song as a ringtone, unless you cut it and limit it to a few tens of seconds (I think the maximum is 30 ").The classic 3.5 mm audio jack has disappeared, a sign that Apple obviously does not like the standards shared with other companies. The result? That all the current headphones (and on the market there are also professional ones of 500/1000 euros), should be replaced. Of course, an adapter is provided, to connect the old headphones to the lightning port, but if you forget it at home, you lose it, or you simply don't want an extra footprint connected to the phone, you will have to change the headphones. Plus, being the only connector, you won't be able to listen to music and charge the phone together, unless you use adapters or sideburns. All this for what? Cost reduction? No, the phone has an internal speaker, so the circuitry to play analog music remains. Phone size reduction or use of the space previously used by the audio jack to increase battery capacity? Maybe. Increase audio quality? No, because the lightning connector transmits electrical signals such as the headphone jack through the contact between different conductors, and the sound quality depends mainly on the characteristics of the headphones, more than on their connector. Maybe the new connector will be more stable, so there won't be the typical rustling of headphones when you rotate or move the connector, but I don't think the average user will feel the difference a lot. Perhaps, and it is my opinion, Apple was interested in giving a boost to the headphone market after buying beats. I do not deny that this solution can lead to better headphones, which can adopt the most suitable (and expensive) circuitry inside them, without depending on the audio source to which they are connected, but this will take time, for the average user (who does not buy headphones from 200/300 euros) will not bring any advantage, and will lead to the death of the only true universal standard left. In fact, now even the competing smartphone manufacturers have declared that they want to abandon the audio jack, pointing to USB type C, so be prepared to change headphones, as you used to change the power supply for the phone. The search for songs on iPhone is very fast: we are still always in front of the successors of the famous iPods, even if the songs loaded on the phone (with iTunes), cannot be extracted from a pc / mac by accessing the device directly, as they are renamed and hidden.MEMORY Finally the 16GB cut disappears , which served only to sell the most capacious models to Apple, as it could not expand the memory of the phone, once purchased. The cuts are now 32 GB, suitable for the user who does not have big claims, 128 GB (suitable for the evolved user), and the 256, ideal for those who need to keep large quantities of photos, videos or audio files, both for work that for passion. Of course there are excellent audio / video straming services, but unfortunately they consume data traffic, and given the costs of Italian data contracts, when you don't have a wi-fi (secure), it's better to have your data in the dear internal phone memory. As for the choice of not being able to expand it with external cards, it is definitely a limit, but repaid by the different performances. The internal memory, in fact, is much faster than the external cards, and not having to be extracted, allows a more advanced management, without the risk of data loss in case of inadvertent removal of the card. Just to give some data, a good removable memory card has real reading speeds of several tens of MB / s (even 50/90), while an internal one can reach 3 times this speed. Unlike competitive phones, by connecting the phone to the PC / Mac, we will not be able to use it as a USB key, or copy data from it, but we will only be able to read the photos on the phone. For all other operations, such as app installation, copying documents, etc..we will have to resort to iTunes. The operating system to give a couple of numbers, during an update without pc / mac, requires to download about 2.5 GB; as many will be in use to make the phone work, and you will need more free space in the phone to install the update. Evaluate which applications you need (a satellite navigator will occupy from 1 to 4 GB, a video game from 0.2 to 2/3 GB, a normal photo of 0.003 GB and a live photo of about 0.005 GB) Having said this, each one draws their own considerations in based on your phone's use. OPERATIONAL SYSTEM is one of the simplest operating systems to use on the market. Compared to Android or windows phone, you will find that it is very easy for a person not to use technology to learn how to use an iOS device. On the other hand, this operating system is very closed, in fact you will not be able to put your favorite mp3 as a ringtone, you will not be able to mix icons and widgets, you will not be able to exchange data with your friends using bluetooth or nfc, but you will gain a stability of the system, which for the no geeks will be fantastic. Advanced users will have functions such as icloud, imessage (a messaging client like whatsapp, which only works with Apple products), and so on. The email client is one of my favorites, and is perfectly compatible with Exchange Server-based corporate mail services. Perhaps sooner or later, the Apple Pay service will also arrive in Italy, to pay off by placing the phone near a shop, without having to take out a wallet, coins, and so on. And let's not forget advanced features, such as automatically saving to the cloud of the photos taken (that we will find again on the pc / mac without the need to connect the phone and extract them manually), the possibility to share calendar and address book with Outlook on your pc, and also with other devices, for example Android. The voice assistant Siri is also very comfortable, who may not always understand what we are asking him for, but which on the whole is not bad at all. Added in iOS 10, also a function that stores where we park the car automatically, and helps us find it again (a feature that was also in Android for years, but that seems more precise here, at least compared to the phones I have tried). PRICEIphone 7 plus starts at just under 1,000 euros. Is it worth the money? Honestly it is a great product, and Apple's support is excellent, but the answer can only be one: no. Everyone makes his own money what he wants, and each person gives the various material goods the value he believes, but objectively, iPhone 7 plus has no features that justify such high prices (and always higher every year). A Galaxy S7 Edge of 32 GB with Italian warranty, is on the 500 euros, and with similar figures take home even the top of the range HTC or Huawei, looking at the android world. Looking at windows phone, then, the top of the range is at even lower prices, even if only slightly. But iPhone is iPhone. If you want a device with 256 GB of integrated memory, you have no alternative.If you want a product that everyone will envy you and let you notice, you have no alternative. The Apple ecosystem is one of the most rewarding, but also one of the most expensive. Do you want an original Apple cover for your new phone? 50 euros (compared to 10 for a great non-Apple cover). And the same goes for all the other accessories, including headphones (if you haven't read the "" AUDIO "" section, I invite you to do so now). Apple products devalue less than competing phones, that's true, but now on the market of used products, of Apple products if they are found galore, therefore also on Apple, we start to find some shop that applies discounts on the new one, something that until a little time ago was a heresy, and the price of the used is always more interesting. Why does Apple always raise prices? Because there are always so many people willing to buy its products, and this is the very simple law of supply and demand. The price of a product, consumers do it above all, and evidently, the mass is good that iPhone costs so much. APPLE CARE PLUSApple supplies the device with only one year of direct warranty, leaving the seller with the burden of supplying you possible second year (if you buy the product as "" consumers "" and not as "" company ""). In general, Apple products are very solid, and if treated with a little bit of tension, they tend to last over time and not present problems. Be aware, however, that the warranty provided by Apple during the first year, and that provided by the ventor in the second year, will be extremely different, and this is due to the high quality standards that Apple tries to keep. Those who want to be assisted by apple also in the second year, and have additional coverage against any damage even caused by the same user, can activate Apple Care plus. The purchase must be made within 60 days from the purchase of the phone, and provides a test of the product by apple, done remotely via the internet. If the test does not indicate problems, you can buy Apple Care Plus at a cost of 149 euros. With this figure, you will be guaranteed premium assistance, and the ability to repair the phone twice, at a pre-determined price. If the display breaks, in fact, the repair will cost only 29 euros, while a damage that requires the replacement of the telephone (with a regenerated one), will provide a fixed cost of 99 euros. Without this extended warranty, the breakage of the display will cost 167 euros, while a complex repair can reach 380 euros. My previous iPhone 6 plus, in two years, has never requested paid assistance (so the money spent on the apple care was "" thrown away ""), but everything depends on many factors, luck first and foremost. The advice if the phone is important to you, and in case of problems you want to be able to bring you to the apple store, knowing you are going to leave the problem within an hour, whatever the trouble. For a normal user, who may take care of the device carefully, the choice is more personal, and depends only on how much "" you want to be calm "". Be aware, in any case, that even in the event of a paid replacement, you will be provided a phone the same as yours.No color changes, no possibility of changing the model, not even paying an extra charge. DETAILS Even now, as with every launch of a new iPhone, you start talking about its flaws too. Some users complain about occasional problems during phone calls, with the interlocutor not understandable at all. Others complain that the phone, when very stressed (for example because you are playing), emits a slight hiss, as if there were an audible fan. Still others complain that sometimes the headphone remote control does not work or that turning off the airplane mode does not hang up the network. Probably other defects will come out in the coming weeks, and we hope that Apple is able to remedy promptly, perhaps with a simple software update. I found audio problems on call, and a slight decrease in the ability to hook up the telephone signal, compared to previous models. Of course, by going to an Apple store, it is likely that the phone will be replaced: but really, after spending 1,000 euros for a new phone, and having used it a month, would you accept to go home with a refurbished one (so used)? It will not be easy to understand what is true in all the complaints that will be read, but it is perhaps worth keeping an eye on any developments. JAILBREAK All versions of iOS, sooner or later, have been "" pierced "" by some hacker, allowing jailbreak of the device. In the past it made sense, as it allowed them to buy apps that Apple censored, and to personalize their phone much more powerfully. Now, without really special needs, I no longer think the game is worth the candle. You have to waste time, you risk finding your phone infected with some malware (which could still install itself, though more difficult), you lose functions or applications, which detecting the jailbreak stop working ... all to really earn few features, since now iOS is really mature. CONCLUSIONThis is a great product, and if you can spend this amount, I can't help but anticipate that you will be satisfied. It is faster than iPhone 6S Plus (maybe it does more or less the same things, but this is a detail) :) and much faster than iPhone 6 Plus. Is it worth an upgrade? In my opinion, from iPhone 6S Plus no, as happens every year, while updating an iPhone 6 Plus, I would say that makes more sense. If you then add an Apple Watch, the user experience will be even better.	0

iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Amazon Customer	5	Does not produce true H.265 files	2018-12-02	de	Even if you have Adobe Premiere Pro CC installed (which has hitherto processed any H.265 file up to 8k resolution without any problems), any attempt to open the not completely compatible Apple MOV container of the iPhone X, together with the HEVC files of other manufacturers, will result in to a crash of the program. And that, as soon as one clicks on the Apple files in the library only! Unfortunately, one has no choice but to post-process the videos before offering them to other websites for sale. For while even a simple 4K camcorder like the Panasonic HC-VXF11 makes the night practically the day and you can still see the blue sky over the city at 2 o'clock in the morning, the iPhone X videos show only deep black areas in the same places. If you then move the exposure control upwards, not more details will appear. The black areas just turn into rushing gray! Maybe Apple should disassemble a Huawei phone and find out how they turn their videos at night. There are real worlds in between on dark streets and neon-lit clubs. High tech scrap is everywhere. But for the price you really expect something else.	0
iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Michael Hinz	1	Many vulnerabilities for 600 €?	2016-07-31	de	The iphone 6s ... a very controversial smartphone ... oh sorry IPHONE of course. I'm more of a fan of the Sony or google nexus series and always had a very bad relationship with appel products. Too expensive, no better than other brands and especially not compatible with other operating systems. These were the typical fears I had. Even if not all really true, they are nevertheless almost all true. The first problem on iphone 6s is the price in my opinion. This shocked me a lot because I am used to getting amazone often very cheap deals. Well, despite this outrageous price, I bought this smartphone angrily. Now the absolute horror began. The iPhone 6s was delivered to SPÆT ONE week for its unreliable delivery services in Germany. That did not improve my attitude towards the iPhone. In the evening after a stressful working day, I gladly unpacked the package. The actual iPhone pack looked very good and neatly processed. In this was a charging cable, a unfortunately not too restrictive instructions and of course the iPhone 6s itself. To my surprise, but no ear-plugs as is the case with many other smartphone manufacturers. Finally, the phone itself. Even if I do not like the formation of iPhones this looked quite passable. The surface is pleasant to touch, but the smartphone slipped from my hand several times a day after a week of use. The shape is not very grippy. The processing quality is so far quite okay and I noticed nothing more negtives. The color of the Displys is perfect and I liked it very well. With the size of the phone, I was not quite good enough, which could be due to the fact that my hands are not too big. Now to the most important: the use. The everyday use is actually rather impractical with this mobile because it is very large and therefore hardly fits in trouser or jacket pockets. As I said, this iPhone tested a week, but actually often wanted to use my smaller smartphone. The drive speed is actually very good. What I noticed as the only VERY POSITIVE was the battery life. Despite everyday business use and with permanently connected WLANs, I had to charge the phone only every other day. But this positive point of the battery unfortunately also brings the most negative for me with this smartphone. This problem has the complete appel series, namely the ports, etc. I, a user of Android smartphones and Windows PCs had great difficulties to couple devices ... that is for non-exclusive apple users a huge problem. So, if we were already at the extraordinary features of Apple, it should be noted as a second, very, negative point, the android user with the apple operating system not easy or difficult to cope. So it was very hard for me to get used to ios and then to regain my money. So the iPhone 6s is now back to Amazon	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	4	Once iPhone always iPhone ..	2016-11-02	de	I could not decide at first between the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7. After two weeks of use of the Galaxy S7, I have to say that Android is too unstable and the apps are not 100% optimized for the device. Mir is known that Android now times hiss manufacturer must provide, but then bothers me but something the advertising in the apps and that in Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger does not see what the opposite of me writes or what I write at the moment, as the keyboard Although there are quite a few other keyboards that can be installed on an Android device (this is what makes the operating system, among other things), I do not need such bells and whistles. I'm in the case just a dull user. So much for the Galaxy S7 in combination with Android. My first smartphone was an iPhone 3GS. Since then, I had only iPhone's in the house and was always happy with it. Clearly you have to live with restrictions such as that one is dependent on iTunes or the setting options in the cp. to Android are not so diverse, but I personally do not need it all. I had initially opted for the Galaxy S7, since the price in the. to the iPhone 7 was much more enticing and I just wanted to try something new. After all, it was enough for two whole weeks. ;-) In addition, I found it a bit disappointing Apple, that the iPhone 7 brings no real innovation. In the end, it is an iPhone 6 2.0.Dennoch I am so impressed with the iOS, that was worth the purchase for me. Before that, I had an iPhone 5. With iOS everything runs smoothly and the apps are perfectly optimized. And that justifies in my opinion the higher price.	0

Here are some again the iPhone z.b. as "" scrap "" designate and one senses when reading the despicable and obviously pathological attitude to Apple and their products.

iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Laurence sarbit	4	My opinion :	2016-10-15	fr	This iPhone 7 brings some innovations compared to the 6s: A space of storage of 32 go of baseAncienement delivered with 16 go, one passes finally to 32 go. However we see that we go directly to 128 GB then 256. Apple is clearly trying to push the consumer to take the most expensive models. A 64 GB entry-level would not have been lux, especially for 769 euros! The camera is also evolving well, but the best is to try it itself to really realize the improvements. home button is no longer mechanical, it's weird at first. The intensity of the haptic feedback is adjustable in the settings and also the first time the iPhone is launched.Certification ip67For this price we could have expected to have ip68 certification as on some Android devices but it is not the case. Too bad ! Anyway it is the first iPhone that enjoys protection against a light swim and dust. If it ever falls into the water, it will take five hours to turn it back on. Stereo speakers. We finally switch to stereo on iPhone, thanks to a built-in speakerphone. The result is nice, without being revolutionary either.Remove the port jack.It is now a reality, no more jack on the iPhone 7. However a lightning adapter to jack is provided in the box. There are also lightning earphones. So be careful if you want to charge your iPhone and listen to wired music at the same time, it will not be possible unless you opt for the Apple doc at 60 euros or use a Bluetooth headset.Ios 10 is very fluid, the passage from one application to another is done without difficulty.Finally, I noticed that the sensor touch id is even faster, the identification of your borrows is instant.Je put a small star in less for the price high, the ip67 certification as well as for the 32 go non-expandable base. So it is a good device overall, even if the price is really too high compared to the competition.	0

iPhone XR	128GB	White	Herr Urmel	5	Fast-paced, excellent 4K video recording and a moderate display	2019-02-08	de	** Initial situation ** I had an iPhone SE before, which became too small for me. Due to the highly praised camera in the Xr I just ordered this one. ** Packaging and shipping ** Ordered directly through Amazon, I can not understand such a bad packaging with such an expensive product. The package was crushed outside, the film of the original packaging already half open and on the side of this a small dent. If you order it directly from Apple, it will come in excellent padded delivery !! Note 6 for Amazon. ** Scope of delivery ** The package is very sad, there are only EarPods with Lightning connection, a (short) Lightning on USB-A cable, the paperwork with opening tool and stickers and the well-known 5W power supply, which takes a felt eternity to charge the smartphone. But I'm still glad that no quick charger is there, such a burdened by the high charging currents the battery is very much and shortens its life. ** Processing ** It is really nicely done. The workmanship is impeccable and it feels high quality, not least because of the high weight of almost 200 grams (!) I would recommend to look at it in advance in an Apple Store and take in the hand. The keys do not wobble and have clean pressure points. The white back in my case is really snow white. I like it very much in connection with the silver frame and the black Displayrand.Ohne cover it is very slippery by the aluminum edges. Here is caution announced! But most of them will - as I disappear in a case, then it is absolutely no problem. ** Speed ​​** Undoubtedly a big plus on this iPhone. Websites are loaded very fast, the operation is more than fluent and everything you do with it just feels fast. If one compares an older iPhone or any other current smartphone one will notice a significant difference. Even a 4K video editing and exporting is faster than with many PC's .. ** Camera ** The 12 megapixel main camera makes in daylight very good and detailed photos. In twilight, it does not convince all along and of course, the resolution in 2019 could be higher, I had in 2015 a SonyZ3, which already had 20, x megapixels.The portrait function, which subsequently makes the background "out of focus", convinces me as a hobby photographer only partially. Cropping works only when a face is detected and in backlight portraits it quickly reaches its limits. There you can not see the hairs separated areas and small mistakes. In good light, the results are quite convincing. I would not have thought of this as a defender of "heavy glass" on the heavy camera. A real innovation is not, that could namely the said Sony Z3 already in 2015 - without a face would have been necessary, although by far not in the quality as the Xr.Was I really like, is the video function. You can film in 4K and 60fps with it! The recorded videos have a high degree of detail and convince all along the line. It should be kept in mind that the 64GB version is only partially suitable for this purpose, one minute of 4K 60fps material needs a whopping 400MB of storage space. ** Display ** Unfortunately, the pixel density is quite low compared to the competition. You should have chosen a slightly higher pixel density and everything would be fine, otherwise the display is really good. It is very very bright and quite stable in perspective. The thick edges around the display are not really disturbing and are only noticeable in a direct comparison if it is next to an Xs. The NightShift function is absolutely brilliant and spares the eyes noticeably. The transition from day / night on NightShift can be done automatically after sunrise and sunset. You get used to the display very fast and I do not miss the higher pixel density of the Xs models anymore. I had first set the function "" Display zoom "" to "" enlarged "", unfortunately, this letter is strong fringe and reduces the sharpness of this. If you switch to normal, text works much sharper! ** Battery ** The running time is excellent, even after several hours of phone calls followed by several hours of surfing and playing around the Xr evening even loose 50% and more residual charge. Even frequent users should loose their day, with me there are even two without completely discharging the battery. Very good! In conjunction with an Apple Watch Series 4, the battery life is slightly reduced, but there are still two days drin.Die charging time is as written before very long, but it is no problem at all, because the smartphone usually over anyway is charged at night - and it is even better if it is charged slowly to extend the life of the battery.** Qi charging function ** The Qi charging function is great, I use this with a 20-Euro Qi charging stand anchor, which charges the iPhone when depositing despite a 3-4mm thick shell easily. There's nothing else to keep in mind, it just works. ** Face ID ** For me, as a convert of a Touch ID iPhone, it's pure witchcraft. It works just perfect after the setup, which takes a minute. Whether in the day or in complete darkness, with or without a cap, it always unlocks and it does not annoy. The only downside to Touch ID - if it's at the table, you have to pick it up or pull it to unlock it. Of course you can also enter the unlock code, in a brief review what is but much more undecided than the old with Homebutton.Und sometimes it does not work if you yawn: -) ** Software ** iOS in version 12 is a very stable running and fast operating system, which is known to have some limitations in file transfer and data organization. I get along with it excellently, not least because it forms an unbeatable team in conjunction with an iMac and the data exchange and backup via iCloud. System updates come for years and are installed reliably (at night) without annoying. Some updates are somewhat hidden and can only be detected by trial and error, such as shaking the device to make a call, long press on the spacebar, the app updates are sometimes automatic and partly manual To move the cursor around the screen like a mousepad, long press elements in the control center to get additional options. The best are a few tips and tricks - Watch videos to find all the functions. Unfortunately, the keyboard is not as adaptive as the Google keyboard, but still very easy to use after a bit of familiarization. In iOS13, which comes in the fall of 2019, it should finally support the input through Swipe. That could be the above-mentioned Sony then already. ** Weight and size ** Especially when you come from a small smartphone, the dimensions are gigantic. I have only one pair of jeans in which the Xr fits into the front pockets. The best is to look at it and touch it! The weight is unfortunately very high, with the case it is well over 200 grams. I have never had such a heavy phone.Similar sized devices have an average of about 150 grams. Even my first "" mobile "", a huge Motorola with antenna from the year 2000 was much lighter than this chunk. In any case, one could open his walnuts at Christmas time, if one is too lazy to fetch the nutcracker from the kitchen. ** Audio and co. The voice quality is convincing, as is the reception on the phone. I was able to make calls only at one point in my apartment, now it is almost everywhere. The sound of the speakers is surprisingly good and voluminous and to watch videos absolutely sufficient. For listening to music, there are the supplied EarPods with Lightning plug, which sound good, but not more. Bluetooth connections to my speakers and headphones have a high range and are very stable. Unfortunately, the small Lightning has been saved on jack adapter and must now be purchased separately. The missing headphone jack is just a problem if you want to charge it at the same time and listen to music. CarPlay also works very well, everything is loaded and played quickly. The GPS reception during navigation is excellent. Siri also works reliably on my 2017 Skoda on the push of a button and is usually very useful for entering navigation destinations. I find these Animojis in iMessage very funny, which can be recorded via Face ID and even transmit audio. That's great fun - when people in the circle of friends also use a new generation iPhone. ** Conclusion ** It's hard, very fast, makes great videos, and has a modest display. The price is very high but in my opinion justified. In combination with a Mac and other Apple products, it is almost unbeatable.	0

"" they're getting bigger; hä? Apple since the iPhone 6 not ..). I find IOS better than these gushed androit systems, even if the back and forth copy and move files is cumbersome. Interestingly, all Android phones after 2 years look like junk and creak and knit. My last iPhone is now over four years old and the current operating system is still running well and the phone looks great. My Android friends need new devices every two years, I all 4! In the end, the Android / Apple dispute is not worth it. Then every van driver could argue with a sports car or SUV. Some still buy optics, some just for specifications and others for apps ... I've never been disappointed with iPhones / iPads. From the iMac / MacBookPro already; So I'm not an apple freak but the iPhone is alright :)	0

My iPhone 6 I've had for 4 years is in far better condition, so the phone has clearly not been looked after. Battery capacity was at 87% when I got it, its now 85% but I haven't had any issues yet.

iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	nexus-hh	1	Overpriced high-tech scrap	2016-07-23	de	I got the iPhone 6s cheap from the circle of acquaintances, otherwise I always had Android devices. But since I have an iPad, I already knew the software a bit. So the processing is already the first criticism, the slide for the Nano Sim card can move with too much game when it is plugged. Even the home button has too much play and clacking for this price range. The back scratched extremely lightly, the front not so easy. You can not offer a cell phone for such a high price and then say that customers should buy a protective cover so that it does not scratch, it has to be built more robust, so it will be a shoe out of it! In this respect, the much-praised processing quality of iPhones is just a marvel, you just have to look closely, then you realize the miscibility, which are simply unacceptable in the price range. Otherwise, the screen is sharp, but in 2016 with its 4.7 inches and HD resolution not up to date, it should be in my opinion already 5 inches, incomprehensible that Apple is there so hesitant and backward-facing. The operation is really bad in relation to Android devices. This concept of closing with the home button has never opened to me. Why not use the backspace or exit key as touch keys ?? This is also possible with the Assistive Touch function, but not very elegant. The apps run smoothly, but updates take too long even in the WLAN network. The cameras are both good, there is nothing to moan about. The more outrageous that one does not install an optical image stabilizer in this price range. The camera looks out of the too heavy case out (just under 140 grams), the device gets very hot under high load, the battery is a bad joke, no FM radio included, resolution under Full HD. All in all, the device for 850 euros new price in the 64 GB version is much too expensive and the money should make more sense to invest. But as long as there are enough people who throw money into the mouth of Apple for such technology, the probably more fat and the poor factory workers in China are getting dehydrated. Apple runs the Android manufacturers technically for years afterwards. 3D-Touch does not need a human, it would be enough, you hold down a little longer than to apply so much pressure on the screen. Something completely incomprehensible: the fingerprint sensor works only after you have previously pressed the power or home button. Other manufacturers can do that so that you only have to hang up your finger and it is unlocked. The headphones from Apple are miserable, both in sound and build quality, and also slip out of the ear due to the strange shape. The voice quality when telephoning is in view of the price just as bad to call, there is always an annoying noise floor available. I give the iPhone 6S now someone who really wants it, I do not, what a miserable phone.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Berki	3	Many things are out of date	2019-03-24	de	After some android I wanted to switch to an iPhone again. I deliberately chose the iPhone 8 because I wanted the home button again and a fingerprint sensor instead of Face ID. For optics and processing, you really can not say much, Apple stop and definitely beyond any doubt. What I noticed only in the setup and the test in the first few minutes that much of the IPhone is just not up to date anymore. The display is a really blurry and lifeless, if you before Samsung, Huawei etc. has used. Even the display edges are simply unacceptable for a late 2017 outgoing smartphone. In addition, I noticed that the wireless reception is very weak. With my Galaxy S9 I have some areas of the apartment still had two lines reception, whereas the IPhone has no reception at all and the WLAN does not even find. By contrast, the video camera is very good again. I can not say much about the battery, since I only had it in operation for about 30 minutes and then reset it again. On the whole, unfortunately not what I expected and therefore must return.	0

iPhone XS Max	256GB	Space Gray	Christoph K.	5	iPhone Max (imus) - in many ways, including the price	2019-07-05	de	Hello community, with a few exceptions (see my Essential Phone Review) I have been using Apple's 4 from 2010 primarily just more devices from Apple. This also has its reason: the ecosystem and some other trivial things convince me for years at Apple simply more. Usually in the rhythm of two years, I have each brought me a new generation. After careful consideration I'm this year after only about 10 months of iPhone X switched to XS Max. The huge display has just done to me. Enclosed now my experience with the device since release. (Summary below in the conclusion). Packing: Apple-typical, the delivery is once again limited to the bare minimum. In addition to iPhone itself is still a low-power 5W power adapter, a USB Type A to Lightning cable (1m) and the "EarPods" called headphones in the small box. There is still a bit of paperwork and two Applesticker.Usutlich monetary policy reasons, this year the Lightning was painted on 3.5mm jack adapter. Wired headphones can therefore only be connected if you buy the adapter separately for an additional 10 EUR. Design and workmanship: The design language Apple has left the XS Max in the much the same as that of the iPhone 6. The now made of stainless steel frame is slightly rounded and is free of unequal gaps in the glass front and back over. Cut-outs for speakers, connection and above all for the single SIM slot have been processed absolutely clean. There is nothing to complain about the remaining keys as well. The volume, the "Leister" and the "Power" keys can be easily felt and react as desired at any time. The slider for "silent" could be a bit heavier for my sense. A little bit unattractive is also that the glass back is typically very prone to fingerprints and therefore usually looks a little dirty. The same applies to the stainless steel frame.In sum of all features, the device still feels incredibly high quality. With just over 200 g, the device is not exactly a lightweight, but emphasizes once again the very noble appearance of the phone. Incidentally, the size is very similar to that of the Plus models.Display: The 6.5 "OLED display with a crooked resolution of 2688x1242 pixels (458ppi) resolves very sharply and covers it with a ratio of 19.5: 9 85% the entire front surface. As with all predecessors, the refresh rate remains at max. 60 Hz (the touch sensitivity, however, at 120 Hz). With the naked eye and without measuring devices, I can put absolutely nothing on the display. OLED typical, the black levels are perfect (black is black) and the max. Brightness is absolutely sufficient, even under the open sky in the sunshine. The display supports the extended color space after "Display P3" and is HDR10 compatible with DolbyVision. Or more simply, the color representation is also excellent. So that colors are also displayed as intended, Apple calibrates each device individually. What I also noticed positively, is that the front glass and the display below form a quasi unity. Both are so close together that one has the feeling, for example, to touch an icon directly (many devices have a visible layer of air between them). At Apple, however, this is already several generations longer.Performance: This year, the manufacturer has again turned on the performance screw. The performance increase is compared to its predecessors on paper, although as small as never before, but are still processor and graphics unit Also noteworthy is that since the 6s Apple has built particularly fast memory modules based on an SSD and thus additionally improves the overall performance. The device responds very smoothly at any time. Whether long menu lists, elaborate websites in the browser or the resource-hungry games make no difference (unlike z.on the Essential Phone in some areas). Generally, iOS 12 always responds directly to touch gestures. Scrolling is always smoother for me than it is for Android, and the delay in the millisecond range between touching the screen and the first reaction is faster and more accurate than on Android. (In words, the feeling is really hard to describe) All in all, it can be said that the iPhone XS Max has enough power reserves for the next few years too. Software and apps: The XS Max comes with the latest software version, iOS 12. In addition smaller meaningful additions this year a special focus on an improved general performance. Most benefit from older iPhones, but version 12 is also the largest iPhone ever very good. The special thing about Apple is still that the different device categories very interlinked are. Many things are synchronized via the iCloud and are automatically available on iPad or Mac (photos, news documents, etc.). An automatically performed data exchange via the iCloud is very easy to set up and is therefore aimed at non-tech savvy people important point here so clearly for the Apple ecosystem speaks. Another important point for me is the direct software support by the manufacturer. Up to 5 years, the devices are supported with new major releases. Unique in the smartphone sector! In the event that security vulnerabilities are known, Apple i.d.R. Updates very quickly after-for all reasonably current devices. As a platform disadvantage is of course the closed system to see. On the iPhone comes only what is left by Apple in the AppStore. A certain kind of patronage that certainly does not taste many. But this also ensures that the security compared to Android is simply higher. By the way, the app offer via the store is very good and is in no way inferior to the one in Google PlayStore. Most of the time, quite the contrary, because many apps are simply better implemented by the same developer for iOS - in my opinion, at least. By the way, apps related to the iPhone XS Max have to be adapted to the new display resolution by the developer. Those only adapted to the X are simply displayed larger. The first apps are already available for the XS Max and then offer more content. In the next few weeks and months will certainly do much here.Camera: At first glance, compared to the X has not done much - it remains at 12 MP.Von this fact should not be fooled. All the improvements can be found under the hood or in the more powerful software. On the hardware side, the new camera system sheds more light on the sensor, with the result that more details can be recorded especially in low-light conditions. At the same time, the software ensures this , that all inclusive several photos of different exposure are taken and put together to a photo (simply said). The algorithm behind this Apple simply calls Smart HDR. Of all this, the user does not notice the way. All calculations are live and in real time. Smart HDR is especially visible when very bright and very dark spots appear together on a picture. Specifically, light areas are reduced a bit and thus get more details, while dark areas are highlighted. As an example, I would like to call a photo against the sun here. By the way, I am very satisfied with the camera upgrade, I am even very positively surprised. The difference even to the X is in any case greater than I would have expected in the beginning. In comparison, the XS Max is visibly better than the Essential Phone and can certainly keep up in the field of photography with the Android flagship Samsung, Huawei and Co.Improvements Apple made this year synonymous with video recordings. These can now finally be recorded in stereo. Furthermore, up to UHD at 60 Hz or FHD at 240 Hz for slow motion is recorded. Thanks to optical stabilization (OIS), videos also appear to be quite free from camera shake for a smartphone and are not compressed too much. The iPhone will continue to be the reference for video. The front camera continues to have 7 MP, but now support 60 Hz at FHD for Videotelefonie.An Selfie fanatics and Instagram users, however, new gadgets with background blur (bokeh) in portrait mode. The blur effects can be adjusted at any time in hindsight at will and that is very intuitive. Operation: The sheer size of the XS Max naturally also has a corresponding effect on the operation. Even with big hands, it takes some practice to operate the device with one hand. In order to reach the top and bottom of the display, it requires a dynamic posture in the hand. This can be achieved quite well by means of generous thumb movements. Basic controls such as Control Center, Notification Center or the "Back" gesture can thus still be operated. Comfortable and safe, but something else. Preferably I use the phone therefore with two hands, alone for the reason that simple short messages with two thumbs can be written much faster. Also, the much smaller iPhone X, I usually have two Used hands. The conversion is so limited for me. Since the introduction of the iPhone X in 2017 finally the annoying home button was deleted and replaced by a very intuitive swipe gesture. The general ease of use has therefore further increased for my taste. The proven Touch-ID finger scanner has now been replaced by Face-ID, a 3D face scanner. The unlocking of the iPhone takes a very short time longer, but for my feeling, however, reliable. Especially in terms of sweaty or simply wet hands, there were with Touch-ID again and again recognition difficulties. Touch ID was particularly negative to me at the time when I was traveling home on the construction site and I had building materials in my hands every day and therefore the sensor had to be read in every two days. With Face-ID you are spared all this. The eyewear, caps / hats tested by me were never a problem for face recognition. On the subject of security is said that Face-ID, unlike many implementations on Android can not be tricked by a simple photo. Lt. Manufacturer is Face-ID also safer than Touch ID. Battery: Compared to the iPhone X and the recently used Essential Phone, it is much more durable battery. With an identical use case and the same usage time, I usually spend about 1.5 days with the X on about 2.5 days. For me it means: some news / mail, 45 minutes of news reading, 15 minutes of video watching, 30 minutes of streaming music, 30 minutes of other searches in Safari, occasionally taking some photos, other short games. The display Mainstream Eater is controlled by Auto Brightness and is usually set below 50%. If possible I use in each app the dark surface (Dark-Mode). This helps the OLED display to save energy. Bluetooth and GPS are turned on only when used actively. The run times that Apple itself gives seem to be plausible. Cable-bound charging by means of the included 5 W power supply I would not recommend the way. The charging times are just too long with 3.5 hours. Through separate accessories can be the XS Max in 30 min to 50 % fast loading. For this purpose, a power supply with min.18 W, USB-C port and USB PowerDelivery and a Lightning USB-C cable needed, so additional expenditure of about 40 EUR.Als price / performance tip, however, the 12 W iPad power supply is recommended for about 17 EUR or a third-party Power supply of this performance class - eg from anchor for about 13 EUR. Charging times of about 2 - 2.5 hours are therefore realistic. Alternatively, the iPhone can be "wireless" on the standard Qi with at least up to 7.5 watts and in about 3 hours laden.Other: Some users have lt. Internet entries div. Techn. Problems with their XS models (loading bugs, poor LTE reception,). I could not find any of these points for me. LTE reception I feel even better than the iPhone X. Especially the topic of LTE XS is a exciting. Here, Apple has made comparatively large changes, which can have a positive effect, especially in practice. The new Gigabit LTE modem is by 4x4 MIMO very often significantly faster than that of the X, as it simply said, the existing LTE infrastructure can better exploit the network operator. On average I can see a 50% improvement in the download rate at the sites I tested. The best: I do not have to pay more for my network operator. A corresponding tariff with high max. Download rates is required. Otherwise, it may already be throttled (by the network operator) before the XS Max can exploit its advantage. Conclusion: Bottom line is Apple's XS Max, once again, the best iPhone ever. Processing and haptics are above all doubt and can absolutely convince. The OLED display is one of the best that you can get in smartphones and represents the sheer size of much content dar. Also performance in terms of CPU, GPU performance, but Also in terms of speed and fluidity of the operating system are Referenz.berzeugen can also convince the new camera system - mainly by software tricks with Smart HDR.Auch the operation has been revolutionized by swipe gesture instead of home button and Face ID instead of Touch ID really a few and just very well implemented. As annoying I see the minimum scope of delivery and of course the absurdly high price of 1.419 EUR MSRP for 256 GB. Can the device really justify such a high price? I would say no! A very large proportion of users will find Android in much of comparable services at less than half of the price. The iPhone XS Max shows me that despite mega performance, the price / performance ratio still maximally with the note "Satisfactory" can be evaluated. Especially since many accessories must be purchased separately again / can and of course even more money in the cash registers of the manufacturer rinses.Richtig is outrageous (at the price) that no jack adapter and no quick charger are attached.Dennoch, the iPhone is for me no alternative because I have not actually opted for the iPhone itself, but rather for the Apple ecosystem. So one is unfortunately more willing to bite into the clearly too expensive apple. If I do not consider the price, the iPhone XS Max still deserves 5 stars. Otherwise it is rather 4. ++ Design / Processing ++ Display ++ Performance Hardware / Software + Camera ++ Operation + Battery Scope Price If my review was helpful, I would be very happy to receive a corresponding rating. Many Thanks!	0
iPhone 7	128GB	Black	XXX	5	Perfektionismus	2016-10-02	de	My rating refers to the smartphone as such. Revolution and expectations have nothing to do with fitness as well as valuation. I kept coming back to Apple. Intuitive operation, software optimally tuned to hardware, reliability and security (statements from a lawyer, as many Android phones are cracked, at least more than Apple), absolute harmony between products also from Apple.Android, Windows has always disappointed me. Especially music or photo apps, there are always several apps for one. How so? No idea. Now the iPhone 7.Matt Black looks classy and different. Finally, the jack is gone, too old, has had its day. Wireless is the future. Had the 6S before. The battery now lasts 2 hours longer, charging too long. The camera has gotten better, looks mature. Splashing water and protected from stub. Nothing new compared to the competition, but super. Negative I notice that in iOS 10 the music app is totally bad. I liked better before. Straight operation like eg. Favorite title or random mode, I have not found today. Telephoning and communication with car, headphones and other devices easily and reliably. Operation is absolutely great. Touch ID is getting better integrated with the apps, and Force Touch is becoming more and more simplistic. For me, there are 4.99 stars. The deduction is for the music app in IOS 10, but think that will be solved soon or someone can tell me how the above works;)	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	5	iPhone 7, worst decision	2016-12-12	de	So far, you could trust a new iPhone release. Since iPhone7 this is different. The iPhone7 differs in design and innovations little if any from the iPhone6, on the contrary, it is thicker and heavier. The changes are not tangible for a standard user, who eg. Topfotos wants anyway has a SLR camera, etc. The new iPhone7 is now waterproof, great, I'm probably going to go diving with it, I need it. For this reason, the speaker connection is missing now. Ie. while listening to music lug around another moronic cable. And that in the future I am switching to these stupid air pods is excluded. Shall I stick the Sh .. in the ears while jogging? I already regret that I switched to the iPhone7. And the besch ... Home button is a horror. The whole phone vibrates like a surprise egg. iPhone7 never again, sorry Apple, maybe next time again. And then only after extensive testing of the new release.	0
iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Max	4	Fast delivery, but not original packed and without headphone adapter	2018-10-29	de	I received the iPhone 7 in a timely manner after ordering. Unfortunately, it was not originally packaged in my opinion and the Lithning-to-3.5mm headphone adapter was missing. The device itself was not like Apple usual, but covered with a cheap earth-sheeting, which was glued slightly obliquely. Apart from these circumstances that is Device in very good condition, the 3D Touch, the Home Button and everything else works flawlessly - only I hope that I am the first one who holds it in my hand, I was and still am not sure.	0

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Louis G.	1	Only the camera is good	2018-09-19	de	The phone has a good camera but is not special otherwise. It leaves a lot of space next to it and can not compete with Samsung and Huawai mobile phones. I have owned this device for almost a year now and it has become a bit slow. IOS 11 is the worst IOS I've seen so far. It is bended and often crashes the phone. In addition missing important functions, such as: WLAN and Bluetooth can be switched off only on the settings. The phone is too expensive for the performance it brings. I can only advise against it.	0
iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	FcBayernGrafBecker	1	Ugly, cheap and itunes heavy!	2015-10-18	de	Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!	0

iPhone 6S Plus	128GB	Space Gray	Dune21	2	A great phone ... but who died after 10 days.	2019-06-28	fr	Bought new from Amazon, my iPhone 6S Plus has died for no reason after a dozen days - impossible to restart it, more load possible, black screen and no restart possible. Apple did not know what to offer except to send the phone for repair (75km from home, so 150 round trip), so I sent it back to Amazon. Now I'm waiting for the refund from Amazon, which takes 10 days worked (so for them, 15 days) from the date of receipt of the package. For 499 euros, it's a somewhat disappointing experience, even painful, I do not know if there was a better way to find a new phone, now I'm without phone> _ <. The few 10 days during which j I was able to enjoy the phone, it seemed very well designed, perfect ergonomics, impression of power very correct for my use, its only defect compared to current phones is in my opinion at the level of sound (mono, a little too much in the treble, not very nice to listen to music or watch a movie). I only made a few pictures, but they looked good, clearly above the old iPhone. To put in perspective for the most advanced users because I am not a "" power user "" (no games, no gourmet apps, no 4K video), I did not notice any particular weakness. it is a phone that is not at the forefront of technology, but is very nice to use for those who do not want to complicate life, like a Mercedes automatic that would have 100 or 200,000 km. The price (nine) is in my opinion too high for the technology.	0

I got the phone and everything was fine until I tried to use the camera that did not work. Amazon asked me to send it back using their return system. It's been more than a month since Amazon received the phone in its warehouses and since the customer service does not hang in my face, I'm asked to justify sending, that the package was not empty, now that the phone has not been replaced by another. In short, I'm called a thief and a liar without explanation. I am a good Amazon customer usually but here I will stop everything.	0

iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Nadine Laabs	1	SCAM! No new product! Warranty expired!	2018-09-15	de	Attention FRAUD! Seller: TI-Trade, purchase June 2018Ware was delivered quickly, 1. Delivery was defective from the outset, exchange was smooth. The second iPhone, which was delivered seemed to be in commissioning once in order. After four weeks of use, however, showed a defect in the microphone, caller could not understand me despite good cell phone reception suddenly; When playing back videos recorded with the front camera, you could hear noise. I've come to an Apple retailer to claim the 12-month warranty that's usually available on new equipment from the first activation. Based on the serial number was first checked whether the device is still eligible for warranty and to my horror was found that this had already expired. The device was already over 1 1/2 years old, so had no claim to warranty, but was welded sold as new. That's cheating! So I reset the device to factory settings, returned it and demanded my money back. It took a long time until the return was processed despite repeated requests, then the seller said, I did not disable the "iPhone Search" feature and he would now need my Apple ID and password. Haha! Luckily that could be done from a distance (without giving any passwords) and now, after three months back and forth, I finally got my money back. The whole thing has cost me a lot of time and nerves, countless e-mails had to be written and I did not get my money for three months (almost 500 €). I can only warn against a purchase!	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	N. Sims	3	Lightning port earphone dock STILL huge design flaw...	2018-10-13	us	O.K. folks, I love the camera on my new Xs, it is way better than my 6 or my SE. The screen res. and size are great as well. However... Apple has put its heels down on the not reinstating a 3.5 port for ear buds/phones and that, for me, is a really big problem.  We are all reduced to using wireless phones or buds with all their inherent battery usage problems, OR, ear buds made expressly for lightning port connection - with their terrible flimsiness and proclivity to bend  or break.  This may be redundant or not important to many - but I hope that this review may give those pause who find this an important issue, and perhaps ever so slightly cajole Apple to reconsider either re-adding the 3.5 port, or making their lightning cable connection more robust. I have gone through 2 pairs of lightning port  ear buds, and 2 apple lightning to 3.5 adapters. Very frustrating.  Makes the Samsung Galaxy9 (with it's 3.5 headphone jack) really appealing.	0

On the box was a completely different serial number to see, as in the device. I had bought the phone in gold, the serial number of the device showed after checking the Internet on a silver model. The device was also already in use, when I turned it on nothing had to be set up and it was directly the home screen with apps to see. Even after reset to factory settings (in the process was funny to see the Android icon) I could not log in as usual from Apple step by step. I have sent it back right now. Stay away from this device and buy directly from Apple.	0

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	ansich	1	relatively good product except for a limitation	2019-04-05	de	In principle, the device is perfect in almost all respects. However, there are two things that bother me enormously at this price. The speakers are the worst I've ever heard, they can play very loudly, but the sound quality is subterranean, the high notes are too overpresent and drown out the overall very thin sound spectrum, even the s9 felt more "bass" "2. The system performance leaves something to be desired. Noticeable in many situations are micro-stutters that should never exist at such a price.	0

iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	2	Handy = Well, service = flop	2016-04-06	de	I bought the iPhone 6s about 1month before Christmas 2015 and had to notice with astonishment (about 2 months later) that dust in the form of small black dots under the screen was visible. So I sent in the device and got it back after a whopping 7 WEEKS. The screen has been replaced, but there is again a black dot in the middle of the screen. I've really wondered (because of the 7 months and no real improvement) if people at Apple are unable to work properly! So for this price (€ 740) it was a total REINFALL! NO PURCHASE RECOMMENDATION !!!! Buy 740 cheeseburgers at mc's, because you will definitely get more for your money! Price-performance is not right at Apple !!	0
iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	1	Vendor flop, Amazon top	2018-07-19	de	I ordered the iPhone 7 last November and was very satisfied at first, until I took the first pictures. I noticed that the camera often could not fix properly and the image quality was pretty much for the A ****. It was very strange to me, just because Apple is known to have a good image quality. Nevertheless, I was able to live with it. Exactly 6 months later, however, my reservations were confirmed, the iPhone was out, despite loading it could not be switched on anymore and I must add that I treated the mobile phone like in cotton wool (was not exactly that either not much I paid for it). It never fell off, did not get wet and I tried to load it as seldom as possible. I immediately contacted the vendor and unfortunately I just got a standard message in reply, which really disappointed me. Luckily I did not throw in the towel right away and turned to amazon directly. I have to say, Amazon sent me a return slip immediately after my message (without any shipping costs), with the statement I get the full money back , Except for a longer wait and a short response from my side, everything ran smoothly afterwards and I got my money back. Thanks again to the customer service of Amazon, you can really rely on it! The direct provider, however, is more likely to be one Flop .. the Apple devices do not seem to be 100% original and not high quality either.	0

Phone coming from Italy (booklets in Spanish, Italian and Portuguese and description of the products on the back of the box in Italian). Side pack, I find it rather average for a rather fragile product: an Amazon box a little larger than the product and a vague piece of cardboard paper to "avoid" the phone's box to move. The paper is absolutely useless, taking it, the phone box moved in and one of the corners of the box (only that fortunately) is damaged.As delivery, I am both delighted and a little angry : the delivery was made very quickly, within the time indicated by cons I will have preferred a package against delivery for an order of a certain amount ... A package only in the mailbox, it's average. I only have to pretend to be my neighbor and meet the postman to give it to me ... Anyway: Product 5/5; 3/5 package; Delivery 4/5	0
iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Amazon Kunde	1	Totally overpriced	2017-12-16	de	I bought the iPhone outside of Amazon and was previously unsure that it will meet its price. When I got the phone then I thought at first that I will never get my old s8 out of the drawer again but after a short time with the iPhone I did not find it satisfying quite the contrary even I was rather disappointed what I was there for over Had bought 1100 €. Design: The iPhone has a nice and very finished design with the display off. The metal ramen feels very good (better than, for example, the iPhone 8) and gives the device a certain stability. However, if the display is on the whole phone seems somehow immediately cheap rather like a not yet finished and not yet finished covered prototype as a finished iPhone x.Performance -) Display: The display is really good because Apple has done a good job it is on the level of a galaxy s8. Oh yes, the display is not from Apple itself but from Samsung. Apart from the fact that I do not think it's good that Apple praises itself for the display and it was not produced by them at the end, it offers good if not the best black was in a mobile phone. However, it is not as razor sharp as Samsung (and that is one if you have been half a year ago, a galaxy s8 would immediately on) also it is not as bright as the competition. Software: The software is good and clear, but where is the homebutton, which would simply be replaced by a bar that you have to swipe up to get back to the home menu. This is not a big problem at the first moment but it annoys easily even after weeks of use I would immediately exchange it for the homebutton again. Much better this problem would be solved (no more room for the homebutten) with Samsung here there is similar to the iPhone 7 a homebutten without a button. That is the s8 namely by a deceptively real vibrate adjusted. The rest of the software is Apple typical. Personally I would prefer Android with the launcher of the s8 but that's just a joke. Battery: You come through the day and I do not need more. Other: What strikes first (if you take the device in hand) is next to the missing homebutten the missing fingerprint sensor. He was replaced by Face id. This is in good German just a face scanner unlocked your phone. Face id is not bad but I would prefer a fingerprint sensor. The new iPhone :-) possession of the finally wireless charging.Fazid: The iPhone x is not a bad phone and it would be for a price of 400 to 500 euros really ok but for 1100 euros Einstigs price really times overpriced. Especially because with the iPhone x, as with any other iPhone, I always have the feeling of saving the apple at every point - no SD card slot because otherwise you would not be able to demand so much extra storage money - just a display with full HD resolution - Unbelievably small delivery for 1100 € no adapters you have to buy for a lot of money anyway. For Samsung that is different.- cheap China headphone and so on. Because of the above mentioned things and because I have become aware of the purchase of the iPhone x once again how good the Samsung Galaxy S8 is, I have decided to s8 against the drawer If you need a status symbol where he can say wonderful with the iPhone should pick x but who probably have the best and invariant phone should definitely the Samsung galaxy s8, s8 plus or Note 8 because these phones are just better.	0

iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Gary B	1	Defective out of the box	2019-02-26	us	I purchased this xs to replace my 6 plus. Once I got it home, I noticed it would not hook up to cellular data. I also noticed that I had to swipe it two or three times or more to get it to open up. The facial recognition was very slow and sometimes wanted the pass code entered.  When I went to reset it, I couldn’t get it too shut down. It felt like the on off button was not connecting properly. Went back to the store, and the tech went through the same things I did with no success. They wanted me to go outside the store and try the cellular data. I did that with no success. It would make calls and text, but not send or receive photos or data.I decided right then and there, after using 2 hours of my time, I was going return this defective device. I need more reliable equipment for use in my business. I’m a pilot. After paying $1000 plus for it, I was disappointed. I will reactivate my 6 plus, which never let me down, and then consider all other options. They offered to replace the phone with a refurbished unit, or send it in for repair. But since it’s brand new, I can return it per the store policy. I Just don’t feel good about how this has worked out but definitely don’t want to keep this 10s.	0

iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	meine_Güter	3	Von Android zu iOS - it's about the Updates!	2017-06-09	de	Actually, I would have had no reason to make a system change, because I had made friends with Sony's Android well. The system ran stable, was very customizable and clear. In addition, an Android user also has access to the depths of the system, e.g. the file system or update settings of each individual app. Even system menus are configurable (the pull-down menu via swipe gesture from top to bottom for quick access to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, location, LTE / mobile data, etc.) Three things made me headache in the course of pending new acquisition and brought me to Apple: 1. missing updates, 2. missing updates and 3. those stupid oversizes of 5 "" and more on "" ordinary "" devices. The switchover was something, say .. bumpy: no more widgets, worse word suggestions when typing text, almost similarly configured as Windoof, unusable notifications in the pull-down menu, little system information, no access to the file system, selection of Bluetooth connections only through the system settings (in A. also via the pull-down menu), the AppStore is my opinion in comparison to Google Play grottenschlecht and confusing ...... Absolutely incomprehensible, but why I need to adjust the ringtone volume / vibration alert / mute cumbersome in the settings. Have the Apple people never had an Android in their hands? Over time, I've come to terms with iOS, but I'm not really happy with it. Well, the interaction between the apps and the whole system is better solved, but I actually want more usability v.a. through user-specific configuration and faster access to frequently used settings. That does not offer Apple so far. But the arrangement of the navigation icons is really unfortunate: "" back button "" top left is just not, even if you can bring the field within reach for the thumb with double-tap; this is just a workaround and not a solution! One thing hurts me too much: iOS is completely incompatible with Linux on the PC! I need to upload photos to disk via iCloud.com. Again an avoidable workaround; I do not understand why Apple offers the connectivity to Windoof and not to Linux, where many Linux are soooo much better and MacOS itself is a Unix-based system! Of course, there is nothing wrong with the quality and performance of the devices Haptics, sound, display, response and speed, radio interfaces, camera or whatever. It runs! Great also: advertising of apps is not placed so annoyingly prominently by the rather strict guidelines of Apple as with Android. My conclusion: Hardware very well, the software is not really my friend.It is but v.a. a security issue that regular system updates come (where "" regular "" is also relative ... so happens only once a year!); I can still do without new functions, they are nice to have. I'll wait until the Google Pixel has matured.Edit 2017-06-16: I read that the Google Pixel is only supplied to OCT 2018 with new Android versions and by the end of 2019 with security updates. Muhahaaa, that's about to break. Android can be recommended in no case! Just a reminder: the Google Pixel costs 32GB with a whopping € 700 and only came in October 2016 on the market. Then clearly prefer iOS and Apple and hope that because usability moderately for ambitious users still something happens. Update 2017 -10-29 iOS 11 came out and the Google Pixel 2 as well. From the former I had expected a bit more usability and from the second better quality and longer software maintenance. There's only limited usability on iOS 11, and there are some incomprehensible decisions that are very annoying in everyday life - e. G. the new, extended menu does not allow a proper deactivation of the wireless connections, the currently running connections are only disconnected. In order to deactivate WLAN and Bluetooth correctly one has to again cumbersome in the attitudes ...: / Generally the release notes of Apple are a joke ... I mean there are hundreds or thousands of the world's best developers, designers and product managers on it and then there are such things as new emojis as an absolute killer feature for a new version! That's silly. OK, in between are sometimes right developments, such as a new file system or a new App Store, but it has relatively little in daily use. The new pixel is now maintained longer and that's really a good decision from Google! However, some users report display errors (so-called burn-in), especially in the case of the Pixel 2 XL, but this could not be reproduced in the TechStage lab. I think that my next one will probably become a pixel, because Google plays monthly, not just annually, new patches. I am also curious what will become of the Sailfish project ... this is also a very interesting story.	0

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Michael Merfels	1	IPhone, American scrap	2017-06-21	de	Never again iPhone junk. I ordered an iPhone 7 Plus with 128gb, the phone arrived pretty quickly, but sent in a joke package from Amazon itself, as one would expect from a 900 ¬ article, cheap and in no way appropriate , I opened the packaging and had to notice that on the phone the minus button was pressed to adjust the volume and could not be pulled out. And with a brand new phone for 900 ¬, no idea how something with Apple comes through the final inspection. I sent it back immediately and I'm curious how it works with the refund. But the very best is coming first. I thought that somehow it could happen and ordered the same phone again. After a week, the article was delivered, however, since I was not at home, to the neighbors. When I picked up the package, also in the same lousy, cheap Amazon packaging in the evening, I immediately noticed that the box was open at the side. I opened it now on the zipper and on the Handykarton the protective foil was not any longer off, but lay crumpled beside it. After opening the cell phone box almost hit me to sleep, the accessories were completely available, but the phone was stolen from the box, was probably taken out of the side of the cheap packaging and put back after removing the phone. After several phone calls and e-mails with the Amazon Hotline I was told that Amazon does not replace the phone because they allegedly sent the article properly! I have turned my lawyer on and now things are going to court. So if you think Amazon would be a reputable store I have to teach unfortunately a better. I will continue to report	0

iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	hannesle	3	Too expensive compared to similar	2015-11-17	de	For a while I had the Xperia Z5 and the iphone 6s in parallel. However, both have sent back, since both of me could not convince 99% ig. My girlfriend has a Galaxy S6. Here is my opinion about the 6s- The mobile is extremely nimble. You realize that hardware and software work together perfectly - the camera I find (especially in comparison to the xperia z5) very good, above all, you do not have to long back and forth to get good pictures. Night shots makes the S6 clearly better.- The display is very good, a FullHD display but would not hurt. Alone, nothing is noticeable, with high-resolution images and videos, the s6 but sharper. Since this only really stands out in direct comparison, this is negligible for me. Overall, the display convinces.- The phone feels very good in the hands. A hand-feeling negative: - very ugly and much too thick black bars above and below. Even thicker than the Xperia z5- much expensive, especially since only the 64 GB version makes sense. For less money you get better mobile phones overall. Unless you absolutely want only IOS.- no NFC- no wireless charging- IOS customizable to zero on the wallpaper- no widgets- it's not possible to close all apps running in the background together. They almost have to be closed one by one. If you are used to Android, you will have problems with the back button, as it will not work on some apps, others on the bottom, and others. The quality of the speakers is only satisfactory, however This was not a negative argument for me personally because I always use headphones or in the car bluetooth. On the other hand, it can be of interest to someone using the cellphone speaker. For me, IOS is a much too closed system and far too adaptable. The ITunes forced annoying nerves annoying.- No real multitasking possible (for example, youtube and browser simultaneously use each other)	0

iPhone XS	256GB	Gray	Leonardo	2	Iphone Xs with aesthetic defect	2019-05-03	it	I state that Amazon is and will remain synonymous with guarantee for me even after this experience. Unfortunately I find myself making this negative review for the following reasons: I purchased an iphone Xs 256 GB gray sidereal about 10 days ago. The smartphone will arrive on the day and without even turning it on, I apply a previously purchased protection film. I configure the phone restoring my backup and migrating all the main applications, losing half a day. The day after the purchase, handling the phone, I notice a kind of bulge / draft in the upper right part of the iphone. I call support, explaining what I found and promptly sent me a new phone (I love Amazon for this). I put the phone back in its packaging and after a few days of waiting I get the new phone. Same scheme: as soon as I open I apply a New film ( repurchased) to the new smartphone. I put more than half a day to reconfigure everything and reset the first smartphone to make the return. After doing everything, convinced to be okay, I look at the phone and I realize that the new one has the same defect (see photo). from a smartphone costing more than 1200 euros you expect perfection, and instead ... I decided to keep it anyway, because I can't lose other days between backup / restore and mail waiting for the return. However I feel very dissatisfied and above all disappointed for Amazon and Apple (I wonder where is the quality control?) I take this opportunity to ask a question to those who maybe know more than me: but can such a defect affect the physical characteristics? (impact resistance).	0
