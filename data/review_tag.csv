7	iPhone XS	256GB	Gray	Stéphane	5	Perfection ?	2018-12-27	fr	Product complies with the announcement. Received in its box perfectly saddled.Personally, I preferred to go through Amazon to be certain of the quality and the conformity. I think that for a product with more than 1200 EUR, it is better to pay 50-100 EUR more and to be certain of the origin (bcp of reconditioned Chinese products ...) The size is perfect, but I put a little time to get used to the weight (I had a much lighter iPhone 6). But the speed and ease of use is much better, so we get done quickly! :) I had some transport problems with Amazon, which took two weeks to resolve, but I finally received everything. I recommend.
8	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Julien	4	Better than the X	2018-10-28	fr	The product is OK. Side package, I find it quite average for a fairly fragile product: an Amazon box a little larger than the product and a wave of cardboard paper to "avoid" the phone box to move. The paper is absolutely useless, taking it, the phone box moved in and one of the corners of the box (only that fortunately) is damaged.As delivery, I am both delighted and a little angry : the delivery was made very quickly, within the time indicated by cons I will have preferred a package against delivery for an order of a certain amount ... A package only in the mailbox, it's average. I only have to pretend to be my neighbor and meet the postman to give it to me ... Anyway: Product 5/5; 3/5 package; Delivery 4/5
9	iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	Vhee	5	What to say is Apple Battery> 24h	2019-02-12	fr	What I add more compared to the descriptionThe battery is excellent, it lasts more than 24 hours of exchange, 28 hours for me.A 24 hours I still have 25% juice in my battery. So much so that I had an external battery for my iPhone XS, I returned it because it was absolutely useless. Everything is perfect, the seller delivered me express which made me happy. 1 days for delivery. Do not hesitate to ask me questions.

11	iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	elias-d	4	A little expensive	2019-01-03	fr	Very nice phone, I was lucky to have half price thanks to my work because honestly it is much too expensive.It works perfectly the screen is beautiful, the camera also, it produces a sound of very good quality for a phone.The facial recognition works pretty well but it is still necessary to enter its code regularly due to misfire.Attention to protect it well by a tempered glass film because the screen is scratched easily.If the price is not a criterion for you to go, otherwise you will find almost as well for less expensive
12	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	HOUT AL HOCEIMA	4	A TECHNOLOGICAL JEWEL TOO MUCH	2019-06-26	fr	What about the iPhone Xs after 3 months of use? While not disgusting in terms of design, the phone is still quite elegant and offers a comfortable grip. The notch is obviously very present, especially in video, but the performance offered by Face ID enough to pass the pill.The screen is huge. The slab used is clearly one of the best on the market and is a feast for the eyes. Nothing to say either at the processor. He will be able to cash all the things you will do to him without flinching. The autonomy, on the other hand, it is little perfectible. It's not catastrophic, it's true, at least not as much as I thought, Now there's the question of price. And there, there is a frankly a problem. Some of you may have realized, but the price of our phones has literally exploded over the last decade. In 2007 or 2008, the average price of a high-end phone was around 650 € roughly. And now, we turn rather around 1000 €. Apple goes even further and iPhone Xs is available from € 1155 in France. To give you an idea, the French SMIC has reached 1200 € It hurts a lot, it's clear, and there is no need to have done major studies in economics to understand that the iPhone is clearly becoming a luxury product. In the wrong sense of the word. With such a price, one may wonder how Apple is doing to keep selling phones. The answer is in one word: the ecosystem. Unlike an LG, an HTC or even a Sony, the iPhone has a real ecosystem behind him and that is precisely what makes his wealth.

125	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent	mathlann	3	If you come from iOs you will like it	2018-12-23	fr	Bigger than my iPhone7 that it replaces, the iPhone XS hardly fits in the pocket. Moreover with its 208g, it does not pose any problems to jeans but it deforms the pants with less held. In terms of reproaches there is always the lack of the headphone jack which remains a real mess day by day. You have to choose between charging, and having sound. The lightning doubler adapters turning this phone into a real gas plant. So as soon as we have a plug charge we do not break down. And as soon as it rings, we unplug and put on the headphones. We plug in, we unplug, we plug in unplugged .... painful, especially that we still do not fall out of battery anyway and here it is torticolis insured to hold such stuck to the ear while charging the l iPhone and have both hands on the keyboard. So, the parade I have is to have kept the 7 in which I put a chip to 2E at free. And when the XS is HS I make a call back on the 7, which allows me to reload the XS. The slab is less resistant to scratches than the iPhone 7, I already have micro scratches. I have a Mac under 10.11 that I do not want to evolve for issues of software accounting and peripherals. This bone is not old (my iMac is only 2 years and a half!) And yet, it is impossible to swallow the new format of video in H265, nor the photos in HEIF, and Apple does not provide any updates. codec day to settle this, it's just for me unacceptable. So there are workarounds via third-party software, month I make a copy in synology drive, then I get back my photos and video on my NAS that I converted into a suite with handbrake for videos and iMazing HEIC Converter for photos. But it's really painful. Other worries more related to the Apple environment, it is possible to share in airplay the iPhone screen on an Apple TV, but not on a mac .... Except that when you do a quick meeting in an office a lot of people have a mac but no one has AppleTV. So we often find ourselves at 3 or 4 around the tiny screen of the iPhone to zoom and unzoom a document ... .. And as you will always in the middle a follower of android you will not miss a few jokes.And do not use siri, otherwise you will become the Turkish head of the meeting. Apple has removed the touchID in favor of faceID. Except that if like me you're never in front of your tel (put on a support) and well we spend his time doing the code. And it's a big step backwards. FaceID is good, but having a touchID under the screen for example would have been even better! So why not take an android. Really I asked myself this question, and if the pixel3 had had a headphone jack I would have switched. But iOs is much more secure than Android. Believe me, this is my job, there is no debate on it.Privacy is much better guaranteed by Apple.My personal and work environment is entirely on Apple for over 18 years, and I There are my habits. The quality of the product is very good, and my old iPhones still work, including my 3GS that my daughter uses. I had a breakdown on my iPhone 5S and Apple had changed it at the time. The photo and video quality is very good for a smartphone, and the dynamic range much better than my 7. Plus Stabilization allows you to take pictures by hand in low light without being blurred. Disadvantage, I have not yet found a good setup to pair it with my gyro stabilizer. The iPhone7 makes better video with an external stabilizer.iMessage does not exist under android and I use it all the time. I am continuously online and therefore very difficult to join. My mail is systematically saturated. So iMessage allows me to hold several conversations at the same time and several by "chat" even though I'm already at the tel.The quality of display is excelle (almost too because very flattering in terms of rendering) iOs is stable and intuitive . I quickly took the shot of the new gestures. The iPhone XS is powerful and fast, and it is for me a tool of work, so I need a very reactive device. I have a lot of applications that I bought on the store, if I change the dairy, I should buy them.En conclusion the iPhone SX is a very good phone, but a lot of pettiness on the part of Apple spoils the use of the day the day and the price of the terminal is hard to swallow. I left on an iPhone. But not sure that the next is one.

It is perfectly fluid, pure, simple and all in a very great power. Certainly it's expensive but having had for years an android, I do not regret at all seen the quality both hardware and software. It lasts longer and sells better. As for those who have an iPhone X, I think the difference in technical quality is not worth the change of course seen its extraordinary price.

160	iPhone XS MaX	256GB	Argent	Daddynosaure	5	As usual at Apple: great phone (iPhone Xs Max)	2019-01-18	fr	No surprise, the phone is at the top (iPhone Xs Max): performance, screen (OLED), design, finish, iOS. Everything is there. My wife, who is an afficionados of the apple brand, loved her gift. And with 256 GB, she can hold at least 2-3 years (until the next phone change ...) before to fill it.But as usual at Apple, it is paid at the high price and in recent years, I deplore a very high price inflation at Apple (an iPhone at the price of a MacBook ...): it compensates the loss of volume by an increase in prices ... NB: no opinion on tightness, because I have not tested :-)

It's my first iOS and frankly, there is no picture, between Android and iOS, there is a world of difference in terms of technological advance! Your wallet will be bad but your comfort will be put forward! Good buy!

The design is beautiful. Features side, it has one of the best screens on the market, a foolproof face recognition and a perfectly stable and simple OS. As long as we appreciate the sleek style of Apple devices we should not be disappointed.Little less for the lack of some features that I have been waiting for a long time on iOS: more icons in the dock, landscape mode on the screen. Home screen (existed on iPhone 6 Plus or 7 Plus but has since disappeared) and splitscreen (split screen).

287	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Gray	Julien Gdt	5	La Rolls Royce d'Apple	2018-11-28	fr	Being an application developer, it's partly about my work tools. But as an individual, and having had the iPhone X before, I must admit that the main new features are very well received, namely: * Larger screen * High Dynamic Range (even on Youtube videos, while the application does not do not even propose the 4K but hey it's another debate) * The camera! I've never had so much fun taking photos in the dim light, in HDR, edit them in a while, make videos of an impressive quality (even after viewing on a macbook retina screen, quality is crazy) * the eSim, with which I can afford to have a pro line and a person on a single phone.Il is expensive, Apple sells it dearly (thank you Black Friday Amazon for that matter), but for nothing at world I do not regret my purchase.
288	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	Julien Guardona	5	Price!	2019-01-03	fr	BlackFriday so I did not hesitate to save 200 € on this iPhone XS Max! What to say that I am still satisfied with their smartphone.

Serious salesman from A-montain.I ordered this iphone because I wanted to switch to IOS and the design of the phone I liked rather well! I will only recommend this phone to Apple fanatics. Because report / price there is much better on the android side. Pay 1200 € and do not have lightning jack jack ... it already shows the color when you go to Apple.

If you just want to discover the iOS system, it can be a good choice too. I recommend!

316	iPhone XR	128GB	Yellow	Julien	5	Great improvement since my iPhone 7	2018-11-20	fr	I give you my feeling on iphone XR, that I have since last Friday, I had an iphone 7, I had before the 6, the 5 the 4 and the 3G. I was a little scared reading the reviews on the LCD, but given the price difference between the XR and XSmax, I did not hesitate ... the LCD is excellent, the difference with OLED will be noticeable that by those who want to put 300 € more (and again, the OLED does not have that advantages as already indicated in the tests that compare ...). Apple did a very good job by offering the first LCD borderless and with tap up wake function previously impossible to implement on a LCD ..; great autonomy: in average use, we arrive at two days, where with an iPhone X we hold just over a day; it's great to find color on an IPhone! It changes gold and money super tiresome! And the choice among 6 colors is really an asset! Perfect size for those who find the X / XS is too fair and the XS Max really too much. We manage to do almost everything with one hand where it gets a lot more complicated with a plus / Max. very good performance of the camera (a shame for the optical zoom and portraits of Mustaches ...), better in low light than that of the X and previous because photosites larger than the previous iPhone! We can choose 128 GB, and it suits the greatest number where 64 GB today are just and 256GB too much for the average iPhoner ... A real success, no offense to those who have succumbed to an iPhone OLED and who have a hard time justifying the price GAP, especially for a smaller screen and a lighter battery! This iPhone XR is the iPhone of the reason without leaving aside the Apple design or the premium side (best LCD of the market , aluminum and glass ...) I am fully satisfied and in my opinion it is not necessary to spend more! the colored back adds a punchy side, I love it! So except coming from iphone X, I can only recommend the XR! you will have a real gap in terms of display quality, fluidity and autonomy

This is a great smartphone, we hear a lot say that its LCD (Liquid Retina) is zero for a smartphone of 2018 (in front of the OLED (as on iPhones Xs and Xs Max, and other smartphones ..)) but this screen is super good quality. I had an iPhone 6s before, and there I find the screen of the iPhone Xr just huge! He is great. in any case, I love my new iPhone XR Blue 64go !! I highly recommend !
322	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Peter Taylor	5	The latest iPhone at the best price	2019-01-18	fr	Ordered during the BF18 at a price defying any competition, this iPhone XR is the happiness of madame.In terms of size, it is almost as big as the XS max in the hand (or iPhone 6/7/8 Plus) but the screen is really halfway with the iPhone X / XS.iPhone X / XS: 5.8 "" iPhone XR: 6.1 "" iPhone XS Max: 6.5 "" You should know that the XR to edges more pronounced and is thicker, so it's really a big phone in the hand. If you do not like the iPhone 6/7/8 Plus or they do not fit in the pocket, the XR will not be the right compromise. However, if you have never had a large phone in your hand, the XR may be a first approach, but not the most efficient. In terms of performance, the XR screen takes the features of the old iPhone (LCD) in a bit better and has a big battery and the latest processor from Apple.- It means LARGE ENGINE LOW CONSUMPTION. Indeed this smartphone can hold 10 to 15h. You have to go on the games to shoot before 22h! Better than the XS and equal to the XS max.If the screen is the first compromise of the XR against the XS, the second is the camera.For simple it is very good! It offers the portrait mode (the bokeh effect that pleases Insta) and makes beautiful pictures! But of course it is behind the XS when there is a little more than 2m distance in the photo. It does not compare with the very high-end android either (Pixel 3, Mate 20 pro ...) In the end the real criteria for choosing the XR, it is especially the price, a little compromise against some Hundreds of euros. ABOUT THE SELLER I received the phone quickly, it worked well from reception, so I did not have to contact him, the phone has no problem.
323	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Ben	5	Excellent iPhone	2019-06-07	fr	Face recognition at the top, excellent camera. 4G reception better since the recent updates. As for the screen I put the videos on Youtube in 1080p and they are displayed in 828p on this iphone. The image is super sharp and stitched just like on the TV application. Very very good screen. Those who complain do not have the XR. The speakers deliver a very good stereo sound. Super fast to use. Really very pleasant to use.
324	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	TheoFLN	4	Excellent iphone	2018-12-01	fr	Excellent and beautiful product, very beautiful screen, excellent performance, beautiful pictures. Coming from an iphone 6, the change is radical! On the other hand the size and the weight forces to use it more often than 2 mains.FaceID, technical solution or I had doubts, is finally very powerful and very practical, it is also fast to the new gestures.No regret over the hesitation with the XS.Produit nine blister.Delivery on time cons without signature (Amazon shipping) or 4 stars.
325	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Laurie	5	Heart stroke	2018-12-01	fr	I took the Black Friday to buy this iphone because there was a really interesting offer (a hundred euros less than the price at Apple)! I was a little afraid of getting a refurbished phone, or even from China (with the sound of the camera) and I have to admit that I am not disappointed and am even really happy with my purchase. The phone is new, still under plastic with all the accessories provides (charger and earphones). It works properly so far.
326	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Client d'Amazon	5	iPhone XR 64 GO	2018-11-24	fr	Very fast delivery and very well packaged, about the phone; Super iPhone XR, fluid; very nice picture camera at the top; super big screen ... the sound ... a treat ... I recommend ... !!
327	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Tel	2	Mixed for a product over 800 €	2019-01-04	fr	I'm waiting for the bill I requested. In addition there is a fault in the bottom right. Otherwise the rest looks in good condition like a new one.
328	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	NicoF	4	Good phone but a bit big	2018-12-04	fr	The iphone Xr Black is a very good phone on both design and use.-The quality of the screen is excellent. We are not affected by the low density of 326 dpi every day. The image on the screen is really beautiful and does not have to be ashamed of what can be seen on the iphone xs.-Photo quality is very good. I come from an iphone 6, so the difference is huge, especially at night.-Portrait mode works well but not on objects (lack of a second photo sensor) -The battery is amazing. With my moderate use, I can stay two or three days without recharging. Never seen it on a negative iphone.Point I find the phone a little big and heavy. Impossible to use with one hand.
329	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	GANDONOU	1	Big Scam	2018-12-14	fr	Wrapped open, empty phone box without iPhone and accessories
330	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	Client d'Amazon	5	Perfect	2018-11-25	fr	Very surprised because with a reduction of 120 € I did not believe at all but the product is consistent, to see in time but until proven otherwise everything is up to standard!
331	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	Casper	5	iPhone XR Blue 64GB	2018-12-29	fr	A beautiful smartphone, fast, beautiful, a fluid bone, face id and simply magical forget it so easy. The liquid retina works wonders I come from an iPhone 6s, it is clear that it is not oled but it's beautiful, Apple has certainly made the most beautiful LCD of this generation, ditto for the night camera like days is beautiful, ditto video with the 4K and of course the wide angle. For autonomy I confirm 8 hours in video, surfing, games, etc. Etc. The quality of the speakers and powerful and net (netflix). The removal of the home button does not bother on the contrary very quickly we know the gestures that the replace and that are quite natural. With a 6.1 screen you have to love big smartphones.
332	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Client d'Amazon	5	Thank you Amazon!	2018-12-01	fr	After 2 attempts of 4X purchases at a telephony operator and a third attempt at a large high-tech brand impossible to get the phone! Either request for infinite papers, or refused, or more stock (but the money is still debited every time !!) amazon very fast for everything !! Not even 1 week and delivered even before the scheduled date! 0 problem !!! Portable top !! We bought 2! Only damage tel not well packaged bubble paper etc with transport is fragile as well that costs us 1 arm ;-)
333	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	jean marc Patret	4	Fast delivery and compliant product!	2018-11-16	fr	Fast delivery and compliant product. Just miss the bill!
334	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	J.L.	4	Excellent phone but ...	2019-01-02	fr	Hard to find in red in stores, I turned to Amazon. The send was very fast and neat despite the holidays and holidays! Excellent phone. He is handsome. Face ID works very well. Small adaptation time for the large size of the screen (I had an iPhone 7 before), but it is done quickly and I do not see me back to a smaller screen. The battery is very long (almost double my old iPhone) and I'm delighted because I use the phone a lot in a day.I remove a star for two small flaws: the sound is saturated on the bass and light on the treble, but it corrects itself with good headphones. The weight is a bit high and could have been optimized.
335	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	naellec	5	Super screen	2019-01-24	fr	Coming from an iphone 6, the difference is spectacular. The LCD screen is very successful and has nothing to envy to LED screens if it is a very slight increase in thickness and weight it seems to me (but it remains very acceptable). The size of the screen is good compromise: less than a PLUS model and larger than the old standard models. The faceID works perfectly with an instantaneous response time.
336	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Maëlya	5	Excellent iPhone	2019-05-06	fr	Fan of Apple and their iPhones, I went from 7 to XR, finding the XS too expensive for the "more" he had. This iPhone is very good and its big plus: its battery that holds much better than all other iPhones I've had. I find even more beautiful mate around the iPhone than the aluminum X / XS. I took it in black to stay in the "class" side and I am delighted. The photos and videos are excellent qualities, better than those of the iPhone X (for having made real tests with that of my brother). The screen is also very good despite the LCD and not the OLED. The absence of the 3D Touch does not bother me, I did not use it with my 7. For me, the only fault of this iPhone compared to the other last: the absence of portrait mode on animals and objects but there is the portrait mode for humans! This is for me the best value for Apple after 4 months of use.
337	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Axinorm	5	Sent and sold by Amazon, the dream!	2018-11-28	fr	Since the partnership between Apple and Amazon, the latter resells Apple products with the certification of the "" apple "", a bit like buying your phone at the Apple Store but with Amazon prices (-10% at Blackfriday ). The phone itself is top level value for money, the iPhone is the best phones in terms of security / privacy far ahead of the Android. Too little difference between the latest LCD and OLED iPhone Xs to justify the 300 € more.
338	iPhone XR	128GB	Yellow	Dhar	5	Very good iPhone. Good battery!	2019-03-09	fr	I went from an iPhone 6 to this one. In other words, the update is noticeable. Despite the high price, I am delighted with my purchase. The quality of the screen, the performances and the identification by FaceID are top. And most of all, I love its yellow firecracker color! The most impressive difference is the capacity of the battery. In general, I use my phone a lot during the day, especially when traveling pro (web, emails, gps, miscellaneous apps, etc.) from morning to evening. While I had to charge my iPhone 6 several times a day (~ 3 or 4 times), I usually finish the day with 30 to 40% remaining battery with iPhone XR. Very satisfied.
339	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Marie Serra	1	Pity ...	2019-02-26	fr	Product bought November 28 it arrived very quickly and the price was very interesting. But very quickly the phone went off on its own for no reason ... So I went to an Apple store where it was found that there was a problem in the motherboard where the only solution was to make a total exchange of the phone ...

The Iphone XR 128 GO works perfectly and meets my expectations. It is a pleasure to have a shopkeeper who respects the customers and I wanted to write it. -The quality of the screen is excellent. The image on the screen is really beautiful and does not have to blush what can be seen on the iphone xr. Photo quality is very good. FaceID, technical solution or I had doubts, is finally very powerful and very practical. I also added a virtual button to have the technique of my old iphone 7 plus. In short for now everything is consistent and perfect. And thanks to AMAZON for the seriousness.

615	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Christian Le Roy	2	Product far behind the market in terms of quality	2019-03-21	fr	I should have bought it from Amazon and not from Orange ... this smartphone is overpriced for outdated technical specifications, so buy the 8 cheapest XR in comparison has no interest. the image quality is well behind that of the Xs and especially samsung and Huawei, Face ID is a calamity, 3 times out of 10 you have to do its code while it was so simple with the thumbprint and the central button . finished double click on the central button to see his apps open it is a complicated gesture that must be done 2 to 3 times and gives seasickness ... it is painful. When weight is the volume, it's a truck! very heavy and difficult to handle, only positive thing the battery holds the day (would miss more than that you say!). the "truck" escaped me from broken screen hands, the cost of repair announced by Apple store operated 329 € because of the famous Face ID. In short Apple is not what it was, I do not really like Google and its intrusive side but frankly it does not make sense to buy an XR. Rest a good OS and service, the best is to buy on amazon a 7 or 8 until applle recovers, unless ...
616	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	Piranhas	5	My only regret not having bought it by Amazon	2019-05-28	fr	After 3 months of use here is my return: As a prerequisite, I recommend against Android addicts for against, to all others, if you have the budget is a phone that deserves your attention.First, I strongly encourage you go to the store to hold it in your hands and make your own ideaSome will find it too big and thick and prefer a more compact model others, like me, will find it to the ideal sizeOverall the phone does not highlight the latest innovations but I think it's an advantage because it uses well-established techno which makes it reliable. The most One of the best 2 mono sensor on the market (with the pixel 3) Better than an iPhone X or an iPhone 8 plus Still in the photo : you go out the iPhone you shoot you shoot and you have a beautiful picture (Apple has long understood this point that has been taken since by all competitors) Autonomy: 2 days without flinching in daily use it's true appreciable Induction chargingSignificant point that facilitates daily use and frees you from a cable previously essential (I suggest you take a bedside lamp including a recharging system without file) The ergonomics of the iPhone still frozen but still efficient thanks to its integrated system.Advantage: flawless ergonomics and better security of our data6.1 inches diagonal in a smaller size than an iPhone 8 plus (5.5 inches) The repairability better than the competition ensures a longer life (ifixit score 6/10 while the Samsung s10 is 3/10 the oneplus 6T 5/10 or p20 pro 4/10) Resale is also an advantage of iPhones because the device will sell well.Finally security, in case the phone is a "brick" while with any android you have to go through your operator to block the phone (which should be supported by a complaint ) In term of finishes it remains excellentThis is not a successor of the 5c, it is high-end.Finally in terms of power it has nothing to envy to others being equipped with chips of last generation. The counterscertains application developed late on iOS and / or in degraded mode (control app Family SFR for example) or some features are restrained (the nfc for example) Customization possible with android I miss itMore thicker it will not be suitable for everyone and The price can cool more than one but nothing crippling compared to the competition (and its price has greatly reduced) But to take full advantage of the price of the xr is only a startBeing that it you will have to add at least the price of a shell and a protective glass (or film) Then, to take full advantage it will be necessary to expand with an audio headset, streaming music and video services. Finally, a VPN for tranquilityThe 64GB version is sufficient for ordinary mortals or if like me used a NAS to empty the phone regularlyFor those who have all their "life" on the phone (which I recommend without a backup) and those who does not like "delete" take in one with more memoryIn fact, Netflix (if you're the type to download entire series) and streaming music very quickly fill the memory.But with good management 64Go is quite sufficient.
617	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Alexandre	3	disappointment	2019-02-08	fr	iphone sold expensive for what it offers, namely a degraded Xs which itself brings no real novelty compared to its predecessor. False borderless screen, weak resolution, a single lens photo, ... Apple falls asleep and the only reason now to stay on iphone is the IOS much higher than Android. No wonder sales are disappointing. And then stop with these phones too big, make us 5 "" borderless usable with one hand. Highly SE2 if there is a day

632	iPhone XR	64GB	White	MehdiParis	4	The best quality / price ratio by Apple	2018-11-09	fr	iPhone bought in Apple store, but I think my opinion will enlighten some here too In short, it is probably the iPhone at the best value for money that ever released Apple.The only question to ask you if you're about to change your iPhone: do you really need to spend more on an iPhone XS? Personally, I do not think.︎ The + - The price: it remains below the 850 € for an absolutely excellent iPhone- The format: neither too big nor too small. This allows for a very comfortable screen without carrying a tablet.- The quality of the LCD screen is bluffing- The best of the iPhone XS: FaceID, camera at the top, A12 processor, wireless charging ...- The autonomy record (better than any other iPhone) - The design, the choice of color and finishes.︎ The - The storage of 64 GB that may seem insufficient (except if what me, all your docs are in the cloud) - The lack of OLED screen - The lack of optical zoom - The thickness, not bad superior to the iPhone 8 for example and surprising a little at the beginning, even if we it's done quickly.
633	iPhone XR	64GB	White	eric c	1	Well too heavy	2019-04-14	fr	I was used to my SE and hoped for more visual comfort with the Xr. The screen is certainly much larger but too heavy to hold with one hand so ultimately not practical at all. I come back happy to my SE that works just as quickly.
634	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Megami	3	mixed	2019-03-22	fr	Very mixed opinion about the product.It was my first iphone and I must admit that iOS is very pleasant to use and well optimized (compared to Android) .By against hardware level, my opinion is not very positive.Already iphone is very big and heavy.If you have small hands, you may have some difficulties to hold it properly.Venant Samsung Galaxy, the grip is less good and we feel the weight.Le design is n is not exceptional and the finish is much less pleasant compared to the X, XS.The black outline around the screen adds a lot of useless thickness, so when we add more a shell, it becomes really very ugly.The screen is not bad contrary to what we read, even if we could expect better considering the price .. The colors are good, we will feel just the difference in the level of black, compared to an oled screen. On the other hand the brightness could be better. I had to put the light The camera is meanwhile very good.Unfortunately, after a few days I resigned myself to return because of its size and weight too large.
635	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	RG912	5	A refurbished, sold as new!	2019-03-14	fr	When you received the item, you do not even need to open it. Look at the serial number on the back of the box. If the serial number begins with an M, the product is likely to be new. If the serial number begins with an F it is a product reconditioned by Apple, so a used product. Beware, the guarantee is not the same, it is of reduced duration.
636	iPhone XR	128GB	Blue	fenouillette	5	Super phone	2019-01-18	fr	I had a SE that I loved for its size in particular! Finally one adapts very easily to this big size (I wait however to see the summer without coat to put the iphone). It is really great, the Face ID is really nice, the number of gig changes my life, the blue is very beautiful short a great product when we love apple. It is very expensive but finally it is used so much ... (finally me).

Apple quality and ease of use are at the rendezvous.
638	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Le G	5	Perfect	2019-06-29	fr	Totally conquered. Even if it is heavier than my old iPhone 6S, my battery is 2 days without worries (VS less than 1 day with the former), the photos are beautiful including the portrait. I have a preference for unlocking with the finger but works very well with the face. Note that there is no port for "classic" earphones. You have to take an adapter or a wireless headset. Despite these small points, I love it.

Ideal size, super edge-to-edge screen despite the reviews on paper, but only on paper because in reality it's like the 8 more or better. In short ... I am delighted with my purchase at amazon prices.

669	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	MB	5	Drums!!!	2018-12-25	fr	After a lot of searching, I chose this phone to replace my 6s (team of a new battery replaced by Apple). With the same use I spend 7 hours of autonomy at .... 50 hours and I have 20% left! It's day and night. Otherwise I tested the image quality, screen versus screen between the Xs and this one. Objectively I have not seen a difference (and I searched!) Both screens are beautiful and bright.The only negative point for me is the size, it is a little bigger than the X or XS (and therefore inevitably 6S) is embarrassing for one-handed use. Other than that great phone.
670	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	M.ODVL	5	a massacre !	2019-01-28	fr	Coming from the iPhone 7 Plus, I hesitated for a long time between the XS and the XR, which attracted me especially for its red color in which it is simply sublime! Its strong points in my opinion: - the BATTERY! I use my phone a lot for my work, especially on social networks and the battery is extremely good! Longer than the 7 plus or the XS, from 10h to 20h I lost 42% while it was loaded the day before sleep (using a lot of instagram and snapchat) - Face ID is ultra fast and simple d use, even in low light - the quality of the screen is top, I do not see why it is criticized his LCD, I have not seen a lot of differences, at least they are not obvious, with the higher models , except if you want to test data sheets ..- the design simply sublime, for me in red. Regarding the black bands, we get done quickly and I do not find them so shocking. It is not cheap like the 5C, we see that it is of quality and the glass back is magnifique.es points "" weak "": - it is absolutely necessary, like any iPhone, a protective shell, especially with a glass back that may scratch .. and ... that's all, for now I can not find anything else to say, maybe my opinion will change over time but I find it really top.J ' I have personally opted for the 128 GB, which I recommend considering the low price difference with the 64 goVoilà, if you found my comment useful, do not hesitate to let it know by clicking on "" yes "" below, it's always a pleasure :)
671	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	St. Franck	5	Fantastic Screen of Quality and Ideal Size!	2018-12-19	fr	I was expecting a lot from this 6.1 inch screen, and it exceeds all my expectations !! First, 6.1 inches is "" finally "" the ideal size to comfortably browse the net. When I go from the XR to the iPhone 7, the 4.7 inches of the 7 (identical for the iPhone 8) are decidedly too small, the difference is striking! Then we can talk about the Oled as being the new technology, the quality of the LCD screen of the XR is striking! The colors are beautiful, deep, stable regardless of the viewing angle, with very nice contrast. Only one point that could be boring for some, the XR is significantly heavier than 7 or 8. For my part, its weight does not not at all embarrassed. But I strongly advise those who like smartphones, to take an XR in hand before buying it.
672	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Client d'Amazon	5	Nice but too fleshy for an entry-level	2018-12-22	fr	A good phone overall, even if the price is a bit too high, at least 200 euros.J'ai Iphone is still working very well and that is enough for the moment.J'avoue have trouble with the larger screens, although Apple is quite talented in the field and is better than the competing manufacturers in terms of clutter.Plus jack, but that we start to get used.If you have iphone 6 or higher, the iphone xr could suit you. If you just want to discover the iOS system, it can be a good choice too.I recommend!

I did not find the sound particularly good and then no analog output. A camera while on my P20 PRO I have 3 x) Regarding the battery, it's Iphone what, it's not their strong point, after she want about a day. better still than the other iphones.les apps turn well I find the menu is very fast, no major bug, I like the design what is really nice at iphone I think it is that there is a lot of hull available for purchase.voila I gave my opinion does not hesitate to put me a [useful vote] if I could help you or entertain you.

Beautiful screen, good sound	2019-07-09	fr	Bluffed by the speed of execution of the applications, by the excellent sound and the very beautiful screen. Sold and shipped by Amazon and therefore no problem, it's new, original and never unwrapped. With third-party sellers it's less glorious! I do not detail any more, everything was written on the XR, I just give you my personal opinion [I hesitated between 8, 8plus, X, Xr, Xs, Xs +]: it is currently the best choice (still about reasonable) and the best value for money at Apple. The price of more expensive models (XS, XS + is not justified compared to the meager improvements that will be found in tests in the lab but not in real life, by the standard user). Two examples the difference of screens (Oled) and the photo mode (double sensor) it's joke, the screen and the photos on Xr it's excellent, no need more! I hope I have not forgotten anything and that this comment will allow you to make your choice. You can reach me through my profile for any information you would miss. If I can answer it, it will be with pleasure! Thank you for reading me!

689	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Gh0stCrawl3r	5	A top Q / P for an iPhone	2019-03-19	fr	Coming from an iPhone 7, the difference in size and weight is seen directly once both products in hand.The screen quality is just excellent, certainly it's not oLed but view the difference in price must be ultra demanding to see a real big difference and the cover of the slab retina on the face is very good. This changes the previous high and low borders.It is good to finally have a memory size of 64go by default.The absence of the home button baffles the first few hours but we do it quickly.The 3D Touch will surely be missing to those who I used to do it daily, which was not my case personally. Personally, I did not see myself putting 1000th in a phone, at 690th (promo price last week on the black XR) there clearly I am delighted!

However, when I ordered this phone, the description indicated that it was a new product (its price indicated it also), but at the reception I had some doubts and went to inquire directly in the Apple Store, where I was told that this product had already been used ... I then tried to contact the seller, but impossible to reach him ... for months I'm trying, no way to reach him.

It is not very serious, because Apple does things well: it is an iphone spent in service completely refurbished, tested, packaged in its original box and blisters, without any trace or scratch (the case and the screen are systematically changed) and under the same one-year warranty as new units. is not very honest on the part of the dealer who does not speak at any time of reconditioned. It remains a good plan for the price.

Be careful however it is not the French packaging (it surely explains the price), the record and the box are in another language. Works perfectly in France however.
925	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Vitor	4	Damage to the packaging	2018-06-06	fr	The iphone X has been delivered to Amazon Locker following my request.C'est the first time that I do it and I find this system very convenient, so I recommend. The iphone X is new and not reconditioned, for cons I puts 4 stars because the Iphone was not protected by a bubble wrap, just carton packaging (considering the price and fragility, it's a shame) .I was Iphone before, and I wanted to tested Samsung S8 +, and I did not manage to do it, so back home Apple.
926	iPhone X	64GB	Argent	CLAUDINE	5	IPHONE X	2018-04-03	fr	Excellent Iphone, the must. The central button does not exist anymore, but it's a real plus. The screen is fluid and hyper reactive. Delighted with this purchase
927	iPhone X	64GB	Argent	FRED	5	The good plan ...	2018-09-21	fr	Iphone X for 200 to 300 € less than elsewhere ... It was the good plan of the year. Received in 4 working days (they "" said "", cautious, delivery within 15 days). Shipped from Italy, the thing arrived under DHL, nine, under blist ... just the update under Itunes and that's it. Go ahead ... go for it ... I'll make another comment in six months, if the battery is "" loose "" ... because at that price, there's bound to be a "trick", but good, for now everything is consistent as wanted St Steve: robust and reliable, no tangles in sight.
928	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Sébastien Remson	4	Super iPhone (delivery can do better ...)	2018-08-18	fr	Apple fan for quite some time I am very happy with this birthday model! Beautiful, fast, good facial recognition and great price on Amazon! Only downside, a device of 1149 € which had to have a signature on delivery was simply delivered with the courier ... without signature so without proof of delivery! I find it limited ... it could have been taken by anyone.

Product came from London but perfectly functional with French networks and domestic European charger! Trust him
931	iPhone X	64GB	Argent	JOKO61	5	Perfect	2018-04-26	fr	The only true evolution of iPhones since the iPhone 6 and its format change. Having been disappointed by the 7 which is a true copy of the 6, I can assure you that going to 10 is a small revolution in itself. Face ID works perfectly, the portraits photos are beautiful, the battery is particularly good, the borderless screen is great despite the notch.
932	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	M	5	Cheaper nowhere, extremely fast delivery !!	2018-08-02	fr	Bought much cheaper than in store. I took it with 256 GB of memory, which changes me from my last iPhone with only 16GB ... nothing to say. Delivery in 1 working day respected, delivered at 13h battery. Still lacks a little protection in the package, it is still an expensive product that may require more paper etc in the package.
933	iPhone X	64GB	Argent	Garlaschi romain	5	Top	2018-01-05	fr	Not disappointed. Having an iPhone 6s, I hesitated between the 8 and the X. I do not regret my purchase. The screen is fantastic

939	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Paul	4	Product OK, Delivery to review ...	2018-10-05	fr	The product is OK, just an update to start but the rest is in good condition. Phone coming from Italy (booklets in Spanish, Italian and Portuguese and description of the products on the back of the box in Italian). Side pack, I find it rather average for a rather fragile product: an Amazon box a little larger than the product and a vague piece of cardboard paper to "avoid" the phone's box to move. The paper is absolutely useless, taking it, the phone box moved in and one of the corners of the box (only that fortunately) is damaged.As delivery, I am both delighted and a little angry : the delivery was made very quickly, within the time indicated by cons I will have preferred a package against delivery for an order of a certain amount ... A package only in the mailbox, it's average. I only have to pretend to be my neighbor and meet the postman to give it to me ... Anyway: Product 5/5; 3/5 package; Delivery 4/5

941	iPhone X	64GB	Argent	Tyty_poit	3	A very beautiful object, expensive, but not waterproof ...	2018-07-31	fr	I loved it until it fell into the water 10 seconds, and I realize that its alleged tightness, even brief, is a decoy (IP 67 certificate) ... in short a iPhone X which will have lasted only 4 months.Despite this big problem, for the rest, I was very satisfied (face ID, double sensor, ...) When to buy itself, very fast delivery and neat. I recommend this seller, to whom I also bought a tablet, without problem.
942	iPhone X	64GB	Argent	Aupetitgateau	5	Premier Iphone!	2018-02-27	fr	At first I was an anti iphone.

966	iPhone X	64GB	Argent	Client d'Amazon	1	Iphone X reconditioned	2018-11-05	fr	Acceptable lead time, other than that the packaging is mediocre! pack in a simple bubble wrap the phone could have been shocked at any time, the phone itself is in a very average condition, scratch more wear on the side, is the height and the charger iphone included with is a vulgar cable adaptable iphone chinese quality. it is inadmissible in view of the price of the phone of nearly 700e even if it is used to receive and see this type of thing. I do not recommend the seller at all. The phone is delivered alone, without box, earpiece, charger, and instructions. (only with a cable that I do not advise to connect with)

Face ID recognition is really effective, good quality photos, beautiful screen ... Nothing to say for my part No malfunction to report.For those who already had a recent iPhone before, it wins a little in weight and thickness (compared to an iPhone 7 is obvious) but I bought it in knowledge of cause.

973	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Bruno d’amiens	5	It's the iPhone 10.	2018-05-30	fr	This is Apple's bestseller I confirm. Apart from the Face-id a bit slower to open the menu than the Digital-id versions before, the clarity and fluidity is there. The Super Retina screen, the few new unique features of the iPhone X or 10 and manipulations (eg access to the calculator or navigation) are the real differences. Fortunately the little animation during the installation, shows the basic manipulations to know.

976	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Dos Santos Thomas	5	Perfect	2018-01-25	fr	This smartphone is not great, it is perfect. It fits perfectly in my pocket, the quality of the screen is completely bluffing. It's a real jewel in terms of design and for the power I do not have much to add except that I do not have the im To use it perfectly because I do not use Gourmet applications. As far as the battery is concerned, the oled screen does a lot of money and offers bluffing wallpaper, not to mention deep black.
977	iPhone X	256GB	Argent	ABBOUD N.	1	Produced with a lot of beugue including facial recognition (anomaly recognized by Apple)	2018-08-14	fr	This product buve a week after receiving it: black screen at times, speakers sizzle when I mounts the sound (call or music), I hear badly by phone, facial recognition no longer works and for unlock it is very long. The seller took a long time to find a solution (and to respond to AMAZON agents when they wrote him an email to do the necessary). The first complaint for defective product is early July, we are August 14, I visited that same day in an Apple Store (Bordeaux) who confirmed that there was an anomaly of facial recognition: they told me traded in 20 minutes against a new one. Thanks APPLE!

980	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Client d'Amazon	2	A little disappointed	2018-11-10	fr	I received the iPhone X but unfortunately I realized that the phone is not new: it is a phone surely reconditioned or used, but it was not specified on the ad, it was written "NINE" and not "AS NEW" (suddenly even if I recognize that the external state of the phone is impeccable it still impossible to determine the wear of the phone, its components ...). accessories delivered with are not official (not the Apple brand), besides the headphones do not work.I confess to be disappointed ... Result for a phone to almost 1100 euros I tell myself that the quality / price ratio n is not terrible.
981	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	N. R	5	Very pleasant to use	2018-01-27	fr	Apple quality of course, so product well thought out, reliable, bug-free. Coming from an iPhone 6, I feared a time of adaptation with the new gestures to learn as shortcuts screen, but it is actually very natural, very instinctive .The colors of the screen are beautiful, the photos are top.La novelty top: the face id, which works very well, including in the dark. It's very fast, we look at the phone and it's already unlocked. Much faster than the Touch id.In flat: the animoji, you really exaggerate the movements of the jaw so that the character gives the impression to speak like you. In mega flat: the price!

983	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Patrick_34	4	Well as always, but	2018-03-31	fr	A jewel of techno, as usual with the top of the range Apple, but, because there is a but, they start to make small savings on packaging, such as headphones that are wrapped in a kind of ring in fine cardboard that will end up in the trash. Finished the little plastic box very useful. At this price, they exaggerate, hence the 4 stars.And for the rest, the absence of button and the new navigation is a bit disturbing at first, but so natural that we find ourselves very quickly.

985	iPhone X	64GB	Argent	victor	4	Good but FRAGILE !!	2018-05-28	fr	Hello everyone, 6 months ago I have this iPhone and I would like to make a quick conclusion of the experience of this iPhone, I've been on iOS for 6 years and nothing has changed the quality of the iPhone is still at the top However I felt a drop in quality in terms of the strength of the iphone X, indeed the latter is much more fragile especially on the aluminum side that scratches itself even protect and that's why I put that 4 stars I regret the time of the iPhone 6.6 or 7 which was much stronger than that the phone is extraordinary in all points: the photo, the power is good I recommend it without hesitation

I just contacted Amazon to make a file and I hope that the seller makes me exchange very quickly because the price of the phone is unbearable ...
987	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	g9486	2	It is in the old pots that we make the best soup	2019-01-26	fr	I kept my iPhone X a year and I resigned myself to return to a model with digital recognition, I never adapted to the facial recognition. The unlock is almost instantaneous on an iPhone 8 by pressing the Home button on the screen. iPhone X must: 1- that the device understands all one wants to unlock it by analyzing the movements of the device, often either he understands nothing at all, or it triggers facial recognition too early. 2- You have to catch the small tab at the bottom of the screen and put it up so as to indicate to the phone that you want to use it (I never understood why they put this step) If we add the many editors of apps that have not updated their apps for the screen of the iPhone X and the repeated bugs of iOS on iPhone X, I can say that it is with undisguised joy that I return to the iPhone 8.

990	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Greg	4	The screen changes the game	2018-04-19	fr	Being a big regular of Samsung, it is the only iPhone that I support and it is entirely thanks to its screen produced by ... Samsung. The iPhone 8 Plus did not, because of its IPS LDC screen not at all pleased. Note that the FaceID is a real pain compared to the speed and the "all terrain" aspect of fingerprint reader (not easy to direct the phone in all circumstances, especially in a bed).

It's pretty hard to go back to an iPhone with the physical home button after that ^^

1072	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	F&LP	4	The best iPhone of all time ... at a price defying respect	2018-01-18	fr	So yes, let's be clear, this new iPhone X is really excellent. Unlike its big brothers, it brings real innovations: Face ID, AMOLED screen without edges, Wireless charging, Animoji, New camera, processor and so on. Along with its many new features, this phone is also a beautiful object and has a design with little onions. In the state, very little to blame this phone, sold as the future.But, because yes there is a but, you still have to stop 2 minutes on the price. There is still not even ten years, selling a phone at 600 € was already something. Now that in October 2017 we are offered a phone at a price of 1150 € (for who wants to buy it at the price proposed by the manufacturer). Despite all its amazing qualities, we have to recognize that the price of this new iPhone X is much too cleavable and unreasonable. If money or ethics is not a concern for you, go for it. Otherwise the old 6S, 7 and the new 8 will be much better alternatives.

1077	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Client d'Amazon	5	A very good phone	2018-02-16	fr	A good device with facial recognition and removal of the home button. We also have a good stereo sound. I will not comment on the wireless charging, I could not test this function.This IPhone holds well in the hand despite its large screen, I prefer the 8 + .The interface is fluid and the battery is good the load.If I had to find a disadvantage, it is undoubtedly its price that will cool more than one, as well as the removal of touch id that I found practical when I wanted to unlock the IPhone in a pocket for example .Conclusion: If the price does not repel you, you can go there, it is rather a good product.

1081	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	RUBIMAX.fr	3	For your health, limit the use of GAFAM!	2018-03-24	fr	But good when we develop software for pro and must work on any type of support, and that the fan of Apple are so whew in their head that they can offer you old models iphone + 500 € second-hand, bah we add a few hundred euros and at least we have the last iphone blablabla, then it goes well in customers .... (pfff poor planet ...) But let's be realistic, even if the product is beautiful and that the quality is there: it's not worth that price! The battery life is to die of laughter compared to my Nokia Lumia that easily holds 3 days, this iphone without doing anything special in the day is 50% his battery in the late evening ... I found some freeze in some settings which surprised me since saying that their machin-BSD like is so effective that it never happens blah blah ... Also what is awful it's the reliance of Apple's services, it would be nice to stop put handcuffs like that (icloud among others) I still managed to completely disable the icloud service, but there are actions to do to disable all that ... Good in the end: I needed an iphone for the work, not for the fad, and I'm still happy with it.
1082	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	macfana	3	Bizarre	2018-04-05	fr	I'm wondering Amazon alone can do this type of discount compared to Apple's new products ???? No one else does it! May be the power of Amazon Apple does not dare to counter!
1083	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Dinin70	2	Unjustified price ...	2018-07-05	fr	Purchase not checked because received for work.Les plus: - it is pretty-the screen is very beautiful, nothing to complain about. The colors are vivid.- excellent reactivity of the screen. But nothing transcendent, any smartphone half the price has the same responsiveness / fluidity - the battery is long. Two and a half days in high use but no games.- sync mails / outlook / contacts less broken head than on Android.- excellent camera.Level of flat keys: - no micro SD- no button. Extreme slowness at the level of manipulation. We want to close an application? Press for a long time at the bottom of the screen, long press on the window, wait until the small red crosses appear, close one by one applications.- without buttons it is also necessary to do additional manipulations to navigate from an application to the other, to go back on a web page etc.- nice facial recognition but if it does not work (glasses), you have to wait until recognition does not work, wait to put the code etc ...- obligation to go through iTunes to listen to music.- headphones without jack cable. So you have to either discard the iPhone headphones and use the jack cable adapter to iPhone, or have two pairs, one for the iPhone, one for the computer ... To conclude, the battery, the screen and the camera is really at the top, but tedious navigation (what is faster to do anything on an Android ...), the headphones unusable other than on the phone, and the lack of flexibility at the level of music and storage make the price is absolutely not justified and is there only to give some exclusivity to its owner, which is ridiculous.Je have not had other phones too high-end but I'm certain that for € 3-400 less (which is extremely expensive) you can enjoy the same quality without having to suffer the limitations imposed by Apple

1115	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Enzo Hortal	5	Nickel, nothing wrong	2018-10-18	fr	Frankly happy. I ordered my iPhone 8 Plus and it arrived about a week later, knowing that it does not come from France. In a pinch, the only point where I can have something to complain about is the transport: I do not know what happened but there were two carriers who transmitted my package, which has resulted in a mess at the parcel tracking level. But in the end, after understanding what had happened, I was able to follow my package quite normally. The product is perfectly in line with the announcement, it works totally and is provided in the official box, with all accessories: USB cable to Lightning for recharging, a pair of Apple wired earphones with a Lightning connection (because there is no port jack on the iPhone), the small power supply that goes with the cable for charging, a small adapter to turn the Lightning port jack (which can serve, I admit) and all the documentation that goes with it, in short, all that is needed and all that it should normally have. The price / quality ratio is really good and the package was in good condition when it arrived, the carriers do not seem to have fun using it as a hammer or as a door-lock, which is appreciable.Bref, you can go.PS: for those who would like to contact the platform, remember to bring you a license in oriental languages ​​at a minimum.

1413	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	nath38	5	A beautiful and fast iPhone	2017-12-05	fr	Perfect reception! I received the phone one day before the scheduled date. The phone is very beautiful and very fast. Thanks to its big screen I enjoy watching my videos on the go without having to take my iPad! I also made some pictures that give a pretty amazing result compared to my old iPhone SE. The back in white glass is very beautiful.For some, this iPhone is old in its design but for those who, like me, are not yet ready to pass the bar of 1000 euros for their phone, I think it's a excellent choice.The only downside comes from the jack lightning connection. By juggling between the jack cable of the car and the headphones I was already often on the verge of losing it. In addition we must make a choice: we plug the headphones or charge, but it is the only "negative point". The rest is perfect

Not where to start? Often considered a simple evolution of the iPhone 7 (aesthetic very close except the glass back of the latest model), the iPhone 8 brings a few changes: - Faster (thanks to the A11 chip) - Better photo processing (you will find several tests on the net) - Compatible with the Qi charge ... And this is the novelty. Indeed, you can now charge the iPhone by putting it on a charger Qi ... No need to connect the iPhone.The nice thing also is that the memory capacity starts at 64gb (64gb or 256gb in fact). ... Despite this little change, the iPhone 8 (Plus) is a very good phone and we find the qualities of the brand.The screen is very good, the overall finish is very good, powerful and made beautiful photos (Obviously ... Accustomed to SLR ... Difficult to judge a smartphone on it ... But to troubleshoot, I find it convenient). Autonomy is good from the comparisons that we find ... Sorry ... I do not buy an array of Smartphone to compare:) ... Although I am amazed at the autonomy of my Samsung A5 2016 job that I only charge twice in the week (except for Cisco Spark and checking mails ... The use is only by telephone). Speaking of battery life ... The battery capacity is down compared to the iPhone 7 but it is obviously inconsequential ... Good ... For those who know the developments Apple, you will know that there is more to jack jacks (but the adapter is provided ... note that it can not be used wired). Several other brands have followed the movement ... Even Google who have made fun of Apple on this point ... By cons ... the iPhone 8 Plus is a heavyweight office compared to its competitors.If I compare the iPhone 8 Plus (offered to my wife) and my OnePlus 3T ... We feel the difference.Why so few changes? Just because of the iPhone X that will be released soon to write these lines.Quelles differences? Here is what I selected (in favor of the iPhone X of course): - Better screen resolution - Screen that occupies the entire surface before (or almost) - Facial identification.A still note for this last point, what the facial recognition of the iPhone X has nothing to do with that of the last Samsung that you can unlock with a simple photo (bravo security). Indeed, if I do not say nonsense, he There are 30000 IR control points on the iPhone X ... So, if you are in the dark, you put glasses or change your cuts, it will work (theoretically for now ... seen apart at the Keynote where we saw it in action ... And again ... There was a loupé ...). So ... Buy or not this iPhone 8 (Plus)? Ben ... Clearly, if you already have an iPhone 7 (More) ... The interest is minimalThe Smartphone is very expensive ... Damn ... 900 € !!! Well ... It is true that given the time that people spend above ... It's prorated more profitable than a lot of other things.The Smartphone remains a recurring budget for more and more people.The real question will remain ... iOS (the Apple system) or Android (a huge choice and for all budgets)? These are two different philosophies ... For my part, we chose an iPhone (and more specifically iOS) when: - we want to be quiet with a stable system - we want a smartphone turnkey without having to search right and left this or that application - we want to keep a system up to date (with Apple, when a new version of iOS comes out ... The update is available on all iPhone versions at the same time time...Except for the models of 5 years ago) - it does not necessarily hack his phone (easier on Android).

1471	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	laumrr	1	Apple, commercial practices more than abusive but still legal!	2018-02-04	fr	Apple, commercial practices more than abusive but still legal! The new Mac High Sierra and IOS 11 operating systems for itune and iphone are real viruses for your devices over 2 years old! In addition, Apple Care is recruiting a team that has no technical skills to help you solve your problems. problems and will not offer you especially any commercial solution! "" Normal "" will you say, this is precisely their new branding strategy! The planned obsolescence of Apple products is a reality that I have refused to see until it impacts me directly. I am writing this post to prevent others from throwing their money out the window . I have an iphone 6 plus a Mac Book Air and a Super Drive (external DVD player). I had 2 weeks ago the unfortunate act of updating my iphone which worked perfectly on IOS 10 to IOS 11.2.5. Since my phone is less responsive than the one I owned 10 years ago. The applications take looooooooooyear seconds to open, take a photo quickly is impossible, sent a message remains possible if you are not disturbed by the fact that it appears only after you have typed 10 Phrases.I contact the assistance Apple (the story is abbreviated because it took me 9 calls of 2h including 1h systematic waiting, spread over 2 weeks, to obtain the poor result that I will describe you): The assistance tells me to restore my iphone to fix the problems. To do this, an update of itune is necessary, but in order to achieve the update of itune I must first update the operating system of my Mac because none of the sytems were compatible between them. I'm running (with you imagine it much trouble because nothing works as indicated by employees of Apple). After several nights of updates, my iphone is finally restored and all my systems are up to date. ... Finding: My iphone is still slow and my Mac on the latest version High Sierra no longer recognizes my Super Drive (which can not be updated) .I spend my last night on the phone with Apple who does not offers no solution and hangs up leaving me in total disarray (I forgot to mention that my interlocutors have all tried to charge me their package of assistance for products no longer under warranty). To conclude, Si you do not want to spend 800 to 2500 euros for a phone or computer every two years and buy accessories at an exorbitant price that become obsolete after 6 months ... FUY !!!!!! Any other smartphone provider is doing better than Apple now! Apple, I hope this post will continue to complete your reputation so that others do not get caught up in your vast scam. The only time I will lose with you now will be the one I need to propagate this message as widely as possible.KindlyAn ex-consumer.

To start the product is not French, so this is the reason for the low price compare to a phone "iPhone 8" nine. It is not French, but compatible with French operators (I do not know for the Belgians) and it can obviously be put in French at the start. The box is blistered, the phone too and the accessories are official! The phone has no defects (manufacturing) whether physical or computer. In summary you will see no change between this one and a nine apart from the price!

The invoice was sent to me quickly. My only concern is its weight (a little heavy with its 210 g.) And the virtual keyboard Apple that does not include, in the same presentation, letters and numbers, forcing multiple commutations in the entries. Devices running Android do not have this disadvantage. I strongly recommend both the product and the seller.

1547	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Argent 	Indrik	4	A classic design proven for a smartphone faster and more powerful than its elders.	2017-11-30	fr	True to Apple, for several years, after seeing how much reception sensitivity was much better than at Samsung. Residing in an area always limited to Edge and FPRS, it is a priority factor. After studying at length the promises iPhone X, with its OLED screen, I decided to opt for the iPhone 8 Plus to succeed an iPhone 6 Plus. Why? - It was obvious that the iPhone X would be much more fragile, considering its design ... What has not missed.- Both being equipped with the chip A11, and the wireless charging.- The unacceptable price difference, OLED technology or not. In this regard, let's not forget that the latter is from Samsung In the end, no regrets with this smartphone boosted by the chip A11, whose graphic quality and the camera are nonetheless improved, and which allows (finally!) The wireless charging.At your disposal for any question, go through the "Comment on this comment", I will answer with pleasure.

1551	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Haks	4	iPhone 8	2018-03-18	fr	Apple faithful to be mm. Not much difference in the use of the phone but the fluidity is much better. Its design changes a little bit but it is very similar to the iPhone 6. Really what is innovative is the induction charge but still have to see if it does not harm the phone. Basically the price is satisfactory compared to the other site, and the phone is very clean for a refurbished. Too bad whether it is wired and not Bluetooth headphones supplied with. Another point is the box that is not at all that of an iPhone .... but it is that details, the phone works very well is consistent with its description

1554	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Space Gray	Zoronoa	4	An iPhone 7s ... or 6SSS	2017-09-28	fr	Hello, That's my opinion after a few days, This iPhone has everything a superb phone, but I always have something to blame him, I explain: - DESIGN -First of all, design, we are at Apple , it's neat, the back glass is just superb, it says slippery but I think it is perfect in hand, Apple says the glass is ultra resistant, I could not test and you will understand I guess ... the finish is exemplary.The pink makes the most beautiful effect with the glass, there is nothing wrong, but ... It is a design that accuses the age, it is now the 4th iPhone found almost identical, the front does not change a bit, the screen is still small for the size of the phone, we feel that Apple has focused on the iPhone X and it's a shame for those who wanted a 8 worthy of the name. We can only compare it directly to android and today most have a screen that takes more surface than the iPhone and for less expensive and it's really a shame! - POWER - This is the real plus point of this iPhone, it is a monster of power, impossible to put it in default, iOS 11 works perfectly on it. Whether for professional applications, games or social networks A11 BIONIC chip of this iPhone does wonders.But the truth is that with the iPhone 7 it was already difficult to undermine the chip of this one is really necessary, maybe for augmented reality ... - CAMERA - The camera of the iPhone 7 plus was already excellent, with the iPhone 8 PLUS we take the same and we evolve. The bokeh effect is still present on the iPhone and it is still these remarkable pictures with a blur in the back is excellent. This new camera do better at night (low light), I was able to do some photos in a dark room is a little better than the iPhone 7 PLUS, there is less noise in the photo is a little cleaner and the flash is softer it is appreciable. During the day, there is better but frankly it is so negligible the 7 PLUS was already doing excellent work.A new mode has arrived "portrait lighting" (allows you to adjust the brightness of your portrait before and after the photo) which is still in beta, so does not work every time for now but it's true that when it works the photos do professional I really appreciate this mode when it is doing its job well. There are new Live Photo effects in iOS 11 that work with the two new Apple smartphones. Loop allows you to loop through one action, while the Bounce effect moves one sequence forward and backward. Another interesting new video, it is possible to shoot in 4K 60 fps or 1080P 240 fps it's nice when you want nice slow motion and a nice step forward when we know that SLRs still have a hard time having these features. - SCREEN - I spoke earlier about the True Tone screen which prevents eye strain, this is one of the novelties of this iPhone, it allows to regulate the brightness and the white balance automatically Depending on the brightness of the room where you are, the iPhone can go from dimly lit with whites a little yellow to a very bright screen with whites closer to blue (I explain how I can lol). This is the only real novelty that I have noticed if all in all if you already had an iPhone 7 or 7 PLUS in hand you will not see a real difference and that's what hurts when we compare it to an S8 that has infinite black! - REPORT - To tell you all, I do not even know how to call this iPhone ... iphone 8? iPhone 7S? Or an iPhone 6SSS I get lost so the design is aging. We proceed to a minor evolution of the iPhone 7 but we can do without.Overall the phone is well built, we can not blame him a lot of things if it is an autonomy that has not increased, He does his job perfectly. But in 2017 we were waiting for something other than a glass iPhone 7. I put it all the same 4stars because as a pure phone it is very good! For me 4 options are available to you: 1 - You absolutely want an iPhone 8 so I advise you to take the 8 PLUS, for its autonomy, its camera and its wider screen.2 - Waiting for the iPhone X but in this case it takes the money that goes with it ... (the prices are very high!) 3 - Take an iPhone 7, the option the smartest I'll say for those who absolutely want iOS, the price of the iPhone 7 has become affordable, it is still relevant and even more when you see the little difference with his little brother the iPhone 8! 4 - See elsewhere on Android if you like a phone but also know if you prefer iOS or Android!
1555	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Oscar	3	A beautiful Peugeot 404 for the toll motorways	2018-04-29	fr	1. CONTEXT I am talking to newcomers in the world of Apple in general and the iPhone in particular: I just bought my first iPhone, the 8 standard, after 3 Android and 3 WindowsPhone, resigning myself to the release of Microsoft from the world of smartphone.2. SERVICE AMAZONAmazon allowed me to acquire this iPhone 8 to 685 euros with a saving greater than 100 euros compared to the market price. Device shipped from Barcelona, ​​in principle destined for the Eastern European market? No negative impact on delivery, equipment and commissioning. This is probably the new trade.3. FIRST IMPRESSIONS A very refined box up to its interior layout, a very nice device, but that I had already approached with a previous smartphone from the Taiwanese HTC. The grip was quite disappointing: I thought I had acquired an Audi Quattro, and I discovered a Peugeot 404 a little restyled, made for the only toll roads of my department. The iPhone was a revolution in 2007; it gives me today a little impression of an old sixty-eight, even if it is well preserved. In detail: 4. THE MATERIALS Beyond the quality of the finish and the aesthetics: - The definition of the screen pixels in width and height) is significantly lower than the current criteria, - The technology of the screen is still LCD while the others manufacturers have switched to AMOLED technology, - The capacity of the battery is 30% lower than the current criteria, - It does not have a fast recharge, - It is not accessible therefore renewable, - The memory of the device is not expandable by a micro SD card, - The cable connection remains clean to Apple, - The main key "" Home "" remains resistive instead of capacitive. It could be advantageously completed to the right and left by 2 other tactile keys. Note the very good operation of the iOS 11 operating system, probably helped by the new and powerful A11 Bionic.5 processor. THE OPERATING SYSTEM (iOS 11) In my opinion, the operating system (iOS, Android, WindowsPhone) is the first feature of a smartphone.5.1 The fans of the iPhoneIl seems that we should not change the habits of the faithful of the first hour who continue to buy the new versions at each of their output, without worrying too much about what the other systems bring over time. One example: iOS does not almost always include the specific context menu that appears with a fingertip held according to the point chosen in the screen.5.2 We are in the closed world of AppleA single example: FaceTime installed to converse with his contacts only allows it with other iPhones owners, unlike his competitor WhatsApp much more generalist.5.3 One is in the hyper-controlled world of AppleOne example: try to recover on your computer media that you have downloaded from your computer to your iPhone or iCloud ... 5.4 We are in a world of moneyI know when it's free, we're the product. But after buying a smartphone to the maximum of the market price for this type of product, everything is oriented, without hiding, to make you spend the most money: music, subscriptions, very limited features so-called free applications etc.EN CONCLUSION "" The iPhone 8 inaugurates a new generation of iPhone. With the iPhone 8, intelligence has never taken such a new form. Not so beautiful. "" That's what Apple marketing says. This can probably convince those who have remained in this world since 2007 and who, let us say, suffer a bit of snobbery to display their iPhone.But currently, the iPhone represents more than 15% of smartphones in use, and it may be time for Apple to better look at what is happening around him if he does not want to suffer the fate of BlackBerry. Between the pump (iOS) and the data pump (Android), difficult to choose . Puzzled ...________________________________________________ POINT IN June 12 2018LES PLUS-quality materials, quality equipment (microphone, speakers, buttons etc.) - The number of available applications-quality applications developed specifically for iOSLES fashioned LESS Conception (one not button at the base, screen technology, screen size etc.) - iOS OS architecture to restructure deeply after 10 years of key enhancements - Safari Internet Browser obsolete - No possibility of memory expansion or battery replacement-More generally, the closed system Apple (how many users do not know how to extract the media files from their device) CONCLUSIONA beautiful little object, exceeded on several levels (it is probably necessary to switch to the iPhone X, but at what price), which continues to feed the cash machine of Apple who lives on its achievements (quality of its applications which the developers are probably well paid, enthusiasm of its fans always on the lookout for the latest model regardless of price) despite the steady decline in its market share. For how long ?
1556	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Client d'Amazon	4	The continuity of the iPhone 7	2017-10-28	fr	A good device overall. The price on its release compared to the iPhone 7 has increased by 40 € but storage level we start with 64 go it's really not bad!

1558	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	C.olivier	4	Good phone!	2017-10-17	fr	Being a big fan of the brand to the Apple I wanted to change my iphone 6s but the iphone X being too expensive I am tempted by the iphone 8. First impressions: Telephones very pretty, the glass back gives a very nice rendering ! Box pretty.I have resigned myself to forget the jack The sound of headphones always at the top, I do not like the headphones intra I still appreciate as much those of apple.The iphone 8 is now equipped with fast charging and wireless, but its products are products to buy separately and is not given, a pity to sell its new technology and not the basics with the iphone.This will cost you very expensive. break the back glass, there is no change of the back, a complete change of the phone will be necessary and it will cost you 400 € !!!! That's why I took the warranty apple a 149 € extra to avoid paying such a sum e of an accidental fall (it will still pay € 99 for the complete replacement of the phone, but still below € 400). Now let's move on to the most interesting: it is in the belly! The iphone 8 owns the new A11 chips which makes him one of the most powerful smartphones on the market. Augmented Reality is one of the apple's workhorses who put a lot on it. The cameras always make beautiful photos but is not the best of the market. I like to make videos with the idle mode which was still improved.The battery has a good battery life, but it must be recharged every night anyway.The iphone 8 still has the touch ID, I who is not convinced by the face ID, the touch ID has done Its conclusive and is easy to use.To conclude if you have an iphone 6s or older and that the iphone X is too expensive, the iphone 8 can be a good alternative.If you have an iphone 7 the change does not is not really necessary unless the new feature (fast charging, wireless, chip A11) really interest you.

1561	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Lucas Bachorz	5	A good iPhone	2017-12-28	fr	This is my first iPhone and I'm not disappointed! The screen although it is only LCD at the time when all the manufacturers have gone to the oled is a safe bet! Plus the new design with glass at the back Stay super nice! A small flat all the same because it is quite fragile and easily takes on scratches! I recommend it to those who can not afford to buy an X but still want a fluid iPhone latest generation through the chip A11 Bionic. The True Tone is a very good option and allows you to use longer are phone. In short it's a great smartphone far from useless

1581	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent	Julien7506	5	iPhone 7 quality, new, not technologically outdated, a home button and iOS 12 powerful!	2019-03-04	fr	Purchased for a gift, the person is very happy, I was able to see the quality of the classic Retina display compared to the Android rivals around 550 € even if in theory the definition and the resolution are lower than these, it does not do not feel visually and yet I am someone very much on the quality of a screen! For example, I find it rivals the 2k screen of my old LG G3. The aluminum body is a real plus for a cautious person compared to the glass or the new steel Apple.Like many people I find more practical smartphones or tablets with a home button and digital identification rather than delete this central button and use facial recognition. The phone is compact, it will be suitable for people who appreciate it otherwise go to an IPhone 7 Plus model. The 128 MB of storage is necessary because iOS 12 already occupies about 21 GB so the 32 GB model leaves no room. The iOS version 12 system has made good progress so now you can do a lot more things than a few years ago, with my IPad Pro 2017 I can do almost anything compared to the first IPhone and IPad. Thanks to Amazon for the correct price with the 2 year warranty ensured the second year by Amazon since not purchased from a merchant partner. The seal has not been tested.

1853	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Guarino	4	The pleasure of iOs	2016-12-13	fr	My last iPhone was the 4th, I decided to go back to Android following the constant increase in prices that I found indecent. I had several Android smartphone since: as a developer, android is practical there is no need to say. However, for everyday use, the simplicity of iOS is felt, fluidity, here we do not speak of battery capacity, processor power: we do not care! The hardware is optimized with the phone, the battery lasts and the apple world is ubiquitous to be connected. The price quickly becomes a secondary factor in view of the benefits. Just a worry lies: how will the phone behave in a few years with an iOS 12 or 13 ...
1854	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Néo	2	Iphone? I'm coming back, and that's the big disappointment ...	2018-03-09	fr	My first i-phone, and bin ouch ouch ... the last ... Nice player, I start with its 5 qualities: + fingerprint locking is top: instant, 100% good "" reading "", no more mishandling in the pocket (AP, sms, calls). All my tel will now have this system + the quality of the speakers! A very good surprise! The 7 finally had 2! Essential for the quality of calls in places a little noisy, and for listening to music. And the one from the top is towards the front (logical but not systematic!), But the one from the bottom is towards ... the bottom :( Do not understand that the quality of the sound is so neglected on ... phones! (Their basic function , no?) + waterproof IP67 (but if worry, the SAV refuses to take under warranty if they find water in it! Not honest on their part ... You are warned (e)) + autonomy (holds a day even very loaded) + application permissions: whew, as soon as they are installed, we are asked if we want to share things, and if so, it's often only when the app is used. I hated androïd for that, it seems that there has been evolution since my last androïd (went through the OS BB meanwhile: the top that disappears unfortunately) .Passons the many defects: - Speaking of BB10 precisely (including the intelligent writing system was learning my common words, correcting even a typo), the SMS writing system is really nil at Apple ... Emojis that replace words: gadget. We can not press "" in "" a word to correct it, we must go to one end and then move in the word "" sliding ""! Serious ?? And then propose 3 words only !!! As for the manipulations to just make a point, a figure ... Waw, the zero degree of practice. (and no, I do not want "" sms "") .- The camera (which I use often). Uh, yeah ... "" Live "" useless. Flash and zoom in sales. For 600 € the piece, it deserved better eh ... (only +: low light without Flash). A little worry for me I still have to take a fingertip ... That the one to whom it never happened to me launches the first stone (or a BB KeyOne, I would prefer) - The small switch on the top left sometimes puts himself alone on Silent in my pocket ... Just raging this thing. If still it was configurable ... Lamentable.- taking lightning owner ... Practice because without meaning like usb-c, but this sometimes poses problems (example: when you want to get the battery repaired by someone one that has a micro-usb charger, so common ...). It's like we have to use a different fuel gun at a gas station because we have an iCar ?! I'll have to explain the interest ....... Lamentable.- Itunes ... Who invented this thing ?? Whether for music or photos, it MUST go through this system. No choice since there is no SD player! Lamentable.- absence of led to signal the arrival of a text message, so practical yet ... Lamentable.- no induction charging on this 7.- the iphone have so many delays on androïd ... The 8 to l induction, yeah; it will be necessary to wait until the 14 to have a reader Sd? the 16 for an intelligent sms writing ?? the 24 for a led-sms ??? What joke ! Even their iphone X is missed. Steve Jobs must turn in his grave.Au final: I do not recommend at all this product, nor all iphone for that matter (opinion objective and argued: I am not a hater). Too many non-parametrible stuff, too closed (itunes, no SD player, lightning plug:), non-removable battery, too much stuff on a daily basis ... The only +, other phones on other OS the do too. My first and last iphone.

1886	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	philippe amari	5	Iphone 7 at the top, is sublime	2016-09-28	fr	Hello, my return after having tested it 1 week model 128 GoLors of his keynote, Apple has as usual promised that his last born was "" the best iPhone "" ever created. Performance side, the iPhone 7 is equipped with a chip A10 Fusion quadricoeur, presented as 40% faster than the A9 that fitted the iPhone 6S. The battery has also been improved: the smartphone would be two hours longer than its predecessor (only one more hour for the Plus version). The iPhone 7 is equipped with stereo speakers and a Retina HD screen with 3D Touch, 25% brighter than the previous one. The home button is no longer physical as before, haptic feedback technology - already present on the trackpad of Macs - is used to give the impression of the click. It is also customizable with three different pressure levels. The most important announcement surely concerns the camera. The front camera goes to 12 megapixels (with aperture at 1.8) and the back to 7 megapixels (aperture 2.2). The flash now consists of four LEDs for better color rendering. But above all, the iPhone 7 Plus is equipped with a dual sensor, two lenses at 12 megapixels each. One is a wide angle, the other is a telephoto lens that provides an x2 optical zoom. Apple promises that its new camera can make more clear, brighter shots and especially to create a bokeh effect with the new portrait mode. Latest evolution and not least, the disappearance of the jack. Apple has made the decision not to equip its iPhone 7 mythical connector. Any audio device must be connected via the Lightning port (which also serves to charge the iPhone) or Bluetooth. So that the change does not feel too much, the iPhone 7 comes with an adapter and EarPods Lightening earphones. Apple also unveiled at the September keynote new AirPods wireless headphones that can be purchased separately for 179 euros. Design side, the iPhone 7 is not very different from its predecessor. As expected, the antenna lines have disappeared. But above all, two new colors are emerging: black and jet black (shiny). This last color is reserved for versions 128 and 256 Go.But remains a little expensive anyway, but I recommend it with pleasureConnial Philippe Amari

In any case, I changed a new iPhone to Apple Stores

1895	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Yann	5	Very nice smartphone	2017-01-17	fr	So I put the note of 5/5 to this iPhone 7, I admit that I was really charmed by this smartphone of the Apple brand..certes not revolutionary but modernized and always more optimized and powerful.In this case , this iPhone 7 is beautiful at first from a visual point of view, well packaged, the device can be discovered in several new colors, note the matte black and the jet black (shiny black), these two colors are beautiful, personally I have a soft spot for matte black.The grip, and the configuration are both very easy and intuitive. Having had the opportunity to own as many iOs (Apple) as Androids, my preference is always Apple, certainly this opinion is personal and I totally believe that others prefer the Android system.The screen is very beautiful ..retina is for something.New for this iPhone 7, the 3D Touch, and the central button "" Home "" touch, these two innovations are at first glance gadgets but they are very quickly essential. Then comes the big change! The pure disappearance of the port Jack in favor of a single port lighting for both the charging of the device and listening to music. Between us, this change can be a little confusing at first, it does not really change much in the overall usage experience. Finally Apple is (as always?) A pioneer of "" risky "" innovations; the jack is already threatened with extinction for a moment.To conclude, a much more powerful camera, always attractive, interesting and pioneering innovations .. A price certainly high, but with regard to the aura of the brand. I recommend this smartphone without hesitation, reminding all the same that 2017 will see the birth of one or more new iPhone in September (should we wait?)!

1902	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Lucas	4	Not bad at all	2016-12-31	fr	Moving from a s6 Edge to this iPhone I am satisfied, even if the s6 of Samsung is really the worst Samsung I had despite the bad reputation of the battery at iPhone I want almost 2 d with the battery while my s6 after 1 years was only half a day.the last iPhone I had was 4 so I can guarantee that the difference is there. This is a great smartphone that is very different from android, very easy to use and very well finished aesthetically. The camera is really not comparable to that of s6 much less performant for my taste the minimum 32 go finally are welcome. For my part I use a USB key with Lightning port sold on Amazon to transfer my file as still no card and a itune still poorly designed for me. I do not know if I would stay on iOS for my next phone since Apple has trouble innovating from year to year unlike competitors. But I think that the year 2018 announces the great news for smartphones. For now I am very satisfied with this iPhone
1903	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Elliot Thomas - Reviewer	5	Another success	2016-09-16	fr	Bought the day of its release I'm not disappointed! Firstly the design is not very innovative it remains faithful to the brand, but the quality of finish and the materials used are very good quality.Coté performance as his usual the iPhone has no slowdown especially since it is equipped with the latest processor from Apple.The camera is also excellent photo rendering day and low light is very good. The front camera allows selfies in all circumstances. The battery is still a big strong point I keep an average of a day and a half which is rather very correct. The screen is BEAUTIFUL colors and contrast are bluffing, nothing To say more jack for the earphone but an adapter is provided with the iphone.Le key ID is always excellent it is very responsive and never bug.En conclusion: As always at Apple, quality products and very performance. Only downside the price is far too high compared to the competition.

The iphone is good CE, but must come from another country (text on the back of the package in another language) Anyway, I'm not disappointed by the iphone, everything works, optimized product, many applications, compatibility with my server Synology, I leave without regret my Lumia which I had almost thrown to the ground several times so Microsoft optimizes well its phones.Certes it is not the same price, but my time is too precious and I have enough lost with my Lumia.Complément following the imminent release of the iPhone 8, Apple put a link for proposed a buyout of your old iPhone to buy the 8. I made the approach with my number and there Apple announces me that this phone with a residual value of 0 € ???? While on the phone Apple had confirmed the authenticity of the product. In doubt, I maintain the 5 star rating, but it's still weird.

It is a very good phone in several points (except at the level of autonomy). However, if you had to buy it in 2018, I advise you to turn rather to the last (Iphone 8 or IPhone X), or even wait until September 2018 to have new models that will look like the Iphone X with a price more affordable.

1954	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	JB	5	Perfect	2017-05-31	fr	An Iphone 7 128GB NEUF for 729 euros, while the official shop price is 879 euros? Yes it is possible! I chose the model sold by Topprice 24 and shipped by Amazon to be serene.The laptop arrived in 48h in its official packaging sealed Apple. The only difference with the model sold in the Apple Store in France = the country of origin. It seems that this one comes from Greece, but not important since the Iphone is multilingual and you can choose French at startup.The phone is at the top, I had an Iphone SE before. This is not the revolution, but a good little upgrade in terms of performance and (in my case) in terms of the size of the screen.Bref, no interest in moving into an apple store to pay the product full pot when one can benefit from this type of deals.
1955	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	hugues	5	iphone as always	2016-12-17	fr	always as well, as usual at Apple, more perfectly waterproof (he has already made a turn in the sink lol), otherwise very good seller at A-MONTAIN no problem more delivered by Amazon premium.

1957	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent	A	5	Adieu Andoid	2017-09-21	fr	I have an android for a few years, I could never resolve to put the price of an iPhone. Finally I got tired, it's like Windows finally: we can tinker as we want but the disadvantage is that it is not as pleasant and intuitive to use because the hardware and software integration is necessarily less good.Apple is more locked but what comfort in everyday life. No regrets. Ergonomics is nickel. A beautiful object with beautiful performances.
1958	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Joël	5	Nickel, I recommend	2017-12-07	fr	Purchased with A-Montain shipped by amazon so no problem. Apparently the iphone does not come from France but there is the outlet for France (some may be bought an apple product with a US plug or other, pay attention). Anyway the most important is that it is new with the Apple warranty so I recommend
1959	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Client d'Amazon	3	Well but flat on the equipment	2017-07-25	fr	Product meets my expectationsOur flat of size: there is no cable to charge the iPhone there is only the plug (useless without cable) and headphones! Frankly I do not understand anything I had everything from provided with my iPhone 6I realized it at the time of loading, fortunately I had the equipment of my old and that it is compatible. In short it almost ruined my pleasure because the iPhone is a great product
1960	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	David	5	Apple simply	2017-09-18	fr	Bought because my 5S had just let me go I'm glad I could find this seller on amazon offering this phone at a very good price. At first sight it seems to me that this phone comes from a country in the east (written on the instructions for use). New, it comes in its plastic film.
1961	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	N.	3	Interesting but ...	2017-05-22	fr	To make a comment clear iPhone 7 Gold 32 GOVendeur 639 eurosA originally, I was looking for an iPhone 6S, cheaper. I went to the Apple site, then other sites and I stumble on a iPhone 7 32 GB for a price lower than a 6S! A conble.Je sell my iPhone 5S speedy and place the order with some excitement (price, marketplace ...). The only point that reassured me was the compatibility "" Prenium "" of the product (without this logo I will not have ordered). Is this a refurbished phone? Opportunity ? Apple's unwanted? I get the phone the day after the order. The packaging is poor (- 1 star), there was no protection, bubble or foam, the packaging was really at least (same packaging as for CD / BluRay) .Ni one, nor two, I take the serial number on the box (with Eastern European scripts) and I check its guarantee on the Apple website. It has never been put into service, it is a new iPhone! I will not apologize for the iPhone 7, other reviews and sites do it better than me.I will add a note (which makes me remove another star from the product): This is the warranty. In France, the iPhone is guaranteed two years, thanks to the legal guarantee of conformity, a formidable weapon for the consumer, which poses in case of breakdown of the phone a presumption of defectiveness on the device ... The first year, you can go to Apple, they will handle the problem, the second, it will advise with the seller ... There the difficulties begin. In my opinion, when you buy here, with a third-party seller, who more abroad ... Admittedly, you will only have a one-year warranty, that of Apple and nothing else. It remains a contractual warranty, the AppleCare + 149 euros which will protect your iPhone for 3 years. This is a calculation to make.In summary: - iPhone 7 nine- Packaging too fragile for a product of this value, it is not a CD! - Attention to the guarantee which is de facto limited Finally, I am ALWAYS in the wait for the invoice from the seller. I will change this comment when I have it and if I do not have it, one less star. This will be embarrassing to resale in a few years.

1986	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Benbross	4	A safe bet but few changes compared to the iPhone 6 / 6S	2017-08-05	fr	After an iPhone 5c having done its hours of loyal service for my companion, it was time to change and go under the new Apple design (which has changed little since the iPhone 6 it must be said). She has therefore acquired a matte black iPhone 7 32GB given the signs of end of life of the iPhone 5c and the lack of storage space (8GB in fact 4GB usable). Brief truce introduction let's go to the test itself. The first visible novelty is of course the design, bigger, thinner, lighter. But having an iPhone 6 myself, we were already used to this design. The only big news visible is the removal of the jack in favor of a whole Lightnening (charger socket). Some other new features are to emphasize, the home button is no longer "clickable" but works under 3D Touch with a "motor haptic "with the ability to adjust the pressure to activate it (as under MacBook Pro and Trackpad actually), the presence of the standard IP67 that allows the phone to resist water (up to 1m and 30mn) . Also note the improvement of the phone's camera with an optical stabilizer that is no longer reserved for version + of the iPhone. I pass you the slight hardware changes in terms of RAM, processors, etc ... which like every year have been a little improved. An improvement to emphasize is the improvement of the autonomy of the device with a larger battery, according to tests it goes from an average of 8 hours on an iPhone 6S to 11h on the iPhone 7 (in intensive use). In short few major changes. An iPhone 7 without much news compared to a 6S or even a 6 but in opposition to a 5 - 5S - 5C the difference is obvious. The +: - iOS- Desgin sober but purified- Screen good quality- Autonomy progressed! !! - Improved camera (front and back) - WaterProof (IP67) - Apple Pay !! - Digital sensor works much better than iPhone 6 -: - Little change in design - Some people will not like it lack of jack and suddenly the compatibility of some headphones / headphones- A device in the very high-end phone and it feels price level
1987	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Soso	5	Fast delivery, new phone in blister	2017-07-27	fr	Fast delivery, the same evening (A-Montain seller). Just send an invoice request to get it. The record is not in French (Russian) but honestly, I did not need it having already had iphones, and if it allows to pay 150 € cheaper than in France for a new product, it's worth it! I offered it to my husband who had an iphone 5 so he was happy and indeed, the change was necessary, but me who has a 6S I do not find huge evolutions. So to advise those who have a version lower than the 5S.
1988	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Guillaume S.	5	The TOP	2017-02-12	fr	The iPhone 7 was released last September and you must know that it does not have a headphone jack and that its design is almost identical to that of the iPhone 6 (2014) and 6s (2015). But despite this apparent lack of renewal, the 7 is indeed better iPhone to date. There are real reasons to choose an iPhone 7, including for those who have a recent iPhone: -Iphone 7 is now waterproof; -The camera is much more powerful, especially in low light and it enjoys the Optical Image Stabilization; - Autonomy is a little better; - The processor is definitely faster. Add to this list, a screen that makes even more colors, stereo speakers, a home button that no longer "clicks" but instead uses pressure sensitive 3D Touch technology. A new home button a little confusing at the beginning elsewhere.So now, if you want to connect a headset or wired headphones, you must go through the adapter provided or opt for Bluetooth wireless models. Or you can use wired headphones with Lightning plug that are delivered originally. The iPhone 7 may be an excellent smartphone rich in novelties, the headphone I miss it.Although its design is always attractive, thin and ergonomic, it looks like to be mistaken for that of an iPhone 6 or 6s. The main aesthetic novelty is the arrival of the new jet black and matte black color that adds to the silver, pink and gold hue. Jet black is sensitive to scratches and fingerprints. That's why I preferred his version Blanche for my wife.The new quad core processor A10 Fusion that equips the iPhone 7 combines performance and energy savings through a mode that optimizes consumption with only two cores solicited. The results are immediately visible through several sessions on GeekBench. The iPhone 7 is really fast, much more than any other iOS device including the iPad Pro. It is also faster than the latest Samsung models and the Google Pixel. This iPhone is a monster of performance.More: The camera and the front camera more powerful with optical image stabilization offer much better photos, especially in low light. Tightness, fast processor, slightly higher battery life, more storage for the same price as last year's modelThe least: no headphone jack (an adapter is provided), the home button without click mechanical which requires a time of adaptation. The jet black version is prone to scratchesI recommend this product without any problem and if you have any questions, I will be happy to answer.If you find this comment useful or at least distracting, please click "" Useful

Although this one does not have a French origin, it does not matter. However, it must be noted that there is marked on the back of the box that the product is compatible with all EU countries.

I highly recommend because there is still a difference of 150 € compared to the price of the Apple Store.
1992	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Client d'Amazon	5	I just love it	2017-01-13	fr	Very happy with my purchase. This phone holds the battery much better than other iphone. I find it very good.
1993	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	aurel46	2	More ahead of the competition	2019-04-02	fr	I have always been a fan of Apple, but now, the competition is very strong. At this price we have a much more powerful smartphone on Android with an onboard screen. Today when I released my iphone 7 I felt like I was going back 5 years. Apart from their incredible operating system, the rest is paid marketing at the price of perfumes.Il is more real innovation since the death of Steeve Job, and yet iPhones increases, Samsung benefits and increases the But beware of the Chinese competition !!! Samsung has for him the most innovative design but pain with overcoats. Except the last at first sight!
1994	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Zoronoa	5	What should have been the iphone 6S	2017-07-10	fr	Hello, I have the iPhone 7 since its release and I will give you my opinion after 10 months of use.- Ergonomics & design: You know what? The iPhone 7 is an iPhone 6S which itself was an iPhone 6, the design has not changed, except the disappearance of the jack and the camera that flattened but widens. There are also antennas that have been relocated to the upper and lower edges of the iPhone. Three new colors are available in addition: matte black, jet black and red at the time of writing this text, when I bought, only the two blacks were available. Despite the little change, the iPhone is very pleasant in hand, it holds very well, exemplary finish, we can just regret the edges of the screen when we see the Galaxy S8 next ... The new button Touch ID is no longer really one, it becomes touch and touch it vibrates, we can adjust the vibrator on three levels and we quickly taste! When I take a 6S or a 6 in hand the button becomes almost annoying! - The screen: The screen is excellent quality really nothing wrong (1334x750px), the colors are very faithful, the brightness in daylight is excellent.- Autonomy: Well, I have had almost all iPhones, I can tell you that the autonomy is better than the 6S we feel that we can hold the day on a semi intensive, it's to say just social networks, messages, a few calls ... if you play a lot, watch YouTube videos etc, it gets a little more fair, in the evening the phone will start to be hungry ... But it's still respectable .- Photo: Sincerely, the photos of the iPhone are excellent, at night it has improved significantly, days is excellent, a very good dive, the photos look natural, small filters are available to make some effects it's really excellent. But I find that next to the 6 and 6S there is no big difference and it is a pity.Hostily this year Apple has added an optical stabilization module and I you that in videos it is indispensable once it tastes.- Use: IOS, it is what makes that I take the iPhone rather than Android, IOS is super pretty, super purified, very easy to use, even the youngest find themselves there easily on it. The OS is very smooth, no slowdown, very very little application crash, the network is very good if you have a good operator. The games do not lag at all, we feel that the phone is powerful. The sound of the speakers is much more powerful than the iPhone 6S.- Conclusion: A consistent iPhone, it is what the iPhone 6S should have been, excellent for a phone everyday as a professional phone, L 'OS is absolutely nice used and very fluid, the camera is also excellent.Après 10 months of use I am always satisfied with my phone, the battery is still the road no complaints.Is it to buy? Clearly we are in July, the next iPhone out in September as much as waiting for the next fate to decide at worst if the new you are not interested in the 7 will have fallen in price.Other question between Android and iOS is mainly depending on the profile of the user, if you are more social networks, you are equipped with Apple (iPad, MBP, etc.) I will say iOS if you want a large screen without edge (S8: D) instead go to Android.I hope that my opinion will have served you add photos from my phone.PS: I forgot !!! It is certified IP67 is to say that it goes to 1m deep for 30 minutes, I even tried and it works I jumped into the pool and took pictures with it and it works perfectly! I do not advise you to do it but for testing it resists well!

1997	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Client d'Amazon	3	Conform to the description	2017-12-22	fr	Article according to the description, I went through the seller A-Montain, I received an iPhone blister in a few days in its original box with its original equipment. Always simple to switch from an iPhone to a other iPhone, I was able to transfer all my data from my iPhone 6 to this one via iTunes in 2 clicks. I put a note of 3 for the shot of mouth, because it has just been made public that Apple was deliberately slowing its old phones being said to spare the life of the battery .. Including the iPhone 7 ... seriously it came out just a year ago ...

2004	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	MehdiParis	4	iPhone 7: the top of the range smartphone!	2016-09-29	fr	Phone bought from my usual dealer, but I leave my opinion on Amazon to guide potential buyers after two weeks of intensive use.As every year, Apple releases a new version of its famous iPhone whose first copy was released there is almost 10 years now.This version 7 is no exception to the annual renewal rules: the advances are many, but do not necessarily justify breaking if you have the previous version (I speak knowingly since I also have the 6S ): - 32 GB for the basic model (compared to 16 GB before) - removal of the main button that becomes touch-more powerful processor- brighter screen- sealing (maximum immersion of 30min to 1m depth) - removal of the jack - New colors matte black and shiny black (jet black) - Better autonomy (we gain about 2h compared to 6S) - Best cameras: 12 megapixels (with o opening at f1.8) and 7 megapixels (with f2.2 aperture) - Stereo speakersAfter a few weeks of daily use, I am (as always with Apple) totally satisfied with my purchase. Ultra-responsive touch screen, top operating system (iOS 10), excellent integration of hardware and software for overall performance optimization (everything is perfectly smooth). When you buy an iPhone, you have no bad surprise (and that's why we put the price). Concerning this famous jack removed, for the moment it does not pose any particular problem: the most of the time, I use the lightning headphones provided; and the adapter (also courtesy of Apple) to connect my Senheiser headset with a jack. In short, I have trouble understanding the controversy as it does not change my habits in reality.Are you crack or not? Note that Apple should release an iPhone 8 next year (the 7 is actually considered internally) as a simple evolution of the 6S) that could be radically different: new design, AMOLED display, induction charging- YES if you have an iPhone 5S or lower => Indulge yourself if your budget allows, you will see a real difference performance.- NO if you have a 6 or 6S => Wait (or save for) the 8 that will come out to celebrate the 10 years of the iPhone in 2017 and that should really break the house.This is NOT a REVOLUTION; -)
2005	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Fabien Fraticelli	5	super phone	2018-03-18	fr	I am expensive apple since the iphone 4 and I am more and more pleased with the innovation that offers apple.Super very intuitive phone and the quality of the videos and just superb as well as the photos its just beautiful .I am using it a lot of my phone for my vlog for my youtube channel and its a real pleasure! I recommend it a great phone the battery holds pretty good and great pictures.
2006	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Client d'Amazon	4	at the height, but price too high	2016-09-17	fr	This iPhone 7 brings some innovations compared to the 6s: A space of storage of 32 go of baseAncienement delivered with 16 go, one passes finally to 32 go. However we see that we go directly to 128 GB then 256. Apple is clearly trying to push the consumer to take the most expensive models. A 64 GB entry-level would not have been lux, especially for 769 euros! The camera is also evolving well, but the best is to try it itself to really realize the improvements. home button is no longer mechanical, it's weird at first. The intensity of the haptic feedback is adjustable in the settings and also the first time the iPhone is launched.Certification ip67For this price we could have expected to have ip68 certification as on some Android devices but it is not the case. Too bad ! Anyway it is the first iPhone that enjoys protection against a light swim and dust. If it ever falls into the water, it will take five hours to turn it back on. Stereo speakers. We finally switch to stereo on iPhone, thanks to a built-in speakerphone. The result is nice, without being revolutionary either.Remove the port jack.It is now a reality, no more jack on the iPhone 7. However a lightning adapter to jack is provided in the box. There are also lightning earphones. So be careful if you want to charge your iPhone and listen to wired music at the same time, it will not be possible unless you opt for the Apple doc at 60 euros or use a Bluetooth headset.Ios 10 is very fluid, the passage from one application to another is done without difficulty.Finally, I noticed that the sensor touch id is even faster, the identification of your borrows is instant.Je put a small star in less for the price high, the ip67 certification as well as for the 32 go non-expandable base. So it is a good device overall, even if the price is really too high compared to the competition.

2010	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent	Charle's Tech	3	Bad	2016-11-06	fr	The screen is scratched super easily, which is already a very bad point. Frankly I do not understand that we can sell a 900 € phone with a screen so fragile! It's shameful, then we will continue with iOS 10 and all its slew of bugs, fortunately the iPhone 7 is not too touched but there are still ... Fortunately, it films very well and the autonomy is strongly on the rise, the 3D Touch and the Home button are super practical and apart from the screen it is really very good. I put only 3 stars because the shot of the screen with 2 scratches only 1 month after the purchase makes me angry, it is just inadmissible to pay a phone as expensive for a glass of such low quality!

But where is the break, or is the change of design , or is the revolution ??? Let us dream, put us on the screen curved, borderless or even flexible ... 3D, picoprojection, phone extra fine.

On the description you are told that the shots are minor and does not interfere with the operation it remains very vagueThat was not clarified that we would not have the phone box and the original charger and taken to put wall. Instead we had a simple charger to connect to USB .... that will probably not work long In general when we see a phone is the box there frankly I do not understand too much.I asked the seller he replied that he did not speak very good French and that considering the price of the phone it was normal that they do not provide the box and charger. It's not really the problem it's just that if c is not written we do not know and it is disappointing if one day we come to resell it will be complicated without the box

I bought this phone from the seller A-Montain ( shipped by Amazon, we're not crazy either;)!) and no worries! Well French box, original outlet, etc ... Just a few hundred euros to save. You can go there with your eyes closed. Received the day after my order, as expected! In short, only positive.

Only small problem in the accessories there was only a charger and the small key for the sim card, there was no express headphones for iPhone 7 and there was also no adapter for headphones normal. Otherwise no bug in the process, to do with time!

The battery nothing to say really tt is at the top. It comes in a generic box, unfortunately there is no earpod, replaced by bluetooth headphones (too big, I do not like) and like more jack, the purchase of earpods or air pods becomes essential .Concerning the cable and adapter, they are not originals too so I advise you to buy to preserve the autonomy of your battery. Apart from these points, I am very satisfied with this iPhone that looks really new.

2071	iPhone 7 Plus	256GB	Black	Phillippe C.	1	IOS multi bugs	2017-10-24	fr	Adept of the iphone for ten years, For this price, it is lamentable. Price / performance do not even deserve a star.Since the SHIFT mid October 2017 = 11.0.3, it's a disasterMulti bugs, and to reset, whether with itune, icloud, a real gas plant. only with software tier (anytrans) that I was able to reinstall a backup, But it is impossible to retrograder in IOS 10. ... which worked very well. Mine is still guaranteed a week, I went in a apple center which informs me that a change of MAJ will be available end of October, But they lost my confidence, it is irreversible.For the price of the iphone, I bought my children two galaxy S8 more. more beautiful, powerful and the photos are more beautiful. moreover we do what we want, it is not locked as apple.Après warranty I jailbreak, like my old iphone, a real breath of air.I wrote to the seller, basically it's dammed you with apple. IS MY LAST IPHONE? NEVER AGAIN !!!

2074	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Kyoshi	4	Smartphone: the choice to make ... iOS or Android	2016-12-16	fr	Smartphone level, clearly a choice is necessary in my opinion: iOS or Android? If the choice is for iOS, well, it's not complicated, it will be Apple.For Android, the choice is very varied. , the phone itself ... It's expensive! Very expensive even.Pay this price for a smartphone ... Mmmhhh ... It hurts! But ... It must be said that the quality is there.And a smartphone is certainly the most used object in the year .It's all the time on either, it is used to go on the Internet, take his mails, play, stay connected to social networks, etc ... Apple improves every year its phones.Iphone 7 does not derogate to this rule: - Sealing (there are still limitations ... 1m deep for 30 minutes) - HP stereo - Best solution for the model no "" More "" - Faster, better camera (as every time) - Better autonomy.The quality of the headphones is very significant (since the iPhone 5 for that matter) .By cons, something that for me makes him lose a star: there is more jack I have invested in a Sennheiser Momentum headphones for its quality ... In wired version because I do not want to have to recharge a headphone (if it is necessary fun to charge, smartphone, headset, smartwatch ... wow!) I can very well use modules to turn my wired headset bluetooth but good ... Or even better, use the Apple Jack adapter <=> lightning. But still an adapter ... In short, it's a personal feeling ... I am disappointed that they removed the jack.Sinon, what to say? It is super responsive that I have always been used to iPhone (or almost ... When the phone is 4 years ... it can rowing ... at last, until the beginning of the month, I had a iPhone 5S and it was always responsive! Unlike the iPhone 4 which is still dragging in a drawer) .I also raises the question of capacity.Finally! The 16GB does not exist anymore! It's time ... It's soon in 2017. However, if you have a good music library, the 32 GB can fill up quickly.With 64 GB, for most people are more than good ... And with 128 GB, there is a margin! It all depends on the amount of music you already have, what you want to do (video? a variety of games?). It depends on your needs and not what the neighbor has.For my part, we chose an iPhone (and more specifically iOS) when: - we want to be quiet with a stable system - we want a smartphone turnkey without having to look to the right and to the left this or that application - one wants to be able to keep a system up to date (with Apple, when a new version of iOS leaves ... The update is available on all the versions of iPhone at the same time ... except for the models of 5 years ago) - we do not necessarily want to hack his phone (easier on Android ) .I have an iPhone since the first version.This works ... Never had any particular problem (small bugs exist but it remains rare and does not last) .Good, the only thing that can be boring is that we do not really feel like changing the phone from one iPhone to the other. There are obviously several system improvements, etc ... A better responsiveness and everything ... But the system itself stay the same.On can be try to go elsewhere ... But we are not necessarily conquered elsewhere ...
2075	iPhone 7 Plus	256GB	Black	Client d'Amazon	2	The price is distressing	2017-08-05	fr	Pay so much for his?!?! It is distressing whereas much cheaper smartphones are largely better and performant like the honor 6x pro for example. Apple places a lot of emphasis on the camera in ads when it's only 12 megapixels. It has only 4 hearts while other much cheaper in 8. In short 900 € for old components, I laughed well

The camera is just amazing. The grip is simple.design is very purify and perfect finishes. This is an expensive phone but for my personal use it is perfect. I advise you anyway the 7 because the 7 plus is large and much more expensive.ca serves There is nothing to take this phone if you just want to go on google. This phone is really great.

2079	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Laurence sarbit	4	My opinion :	2016-10-15	fr	This iPhone 7 brings some innovations compared to the 6s: A space of storage of 32 go of baseAncienement delivered with 16 go, one passes finally to 32 go. However we see that we go directly to 128 GB then 256. Apple is clearly trying to push the consumer to take the most expensive models. A 64 GB entry-level would not have been lux, especially for 769 euros! The camera is also evolving well, but the best is to try it itself to really realize the improvements. home button is no longer mechanical, it's weird at first. The intensity of the haptic feedback is adjustable in the settings and also the first time the iPhone is launched.Certification ip67For this price we could have expected to have ip68 certification as on some Android devices but it is not the case. Too bad ! Anyway it is the first iPhone that enjoys protection against a light swim and dust. If it ever falls into the water, it will take five hours to turn it back on. Stereo speakers. We finally switch to stereo on iPhone, thanks to a built-in speakerphone. The result is nice, without being revolutionary either.Remove the port jack.It is now a reality, no more jack on the iPhone 7. However a lightning adapter to jack is provided in the box. There are also lightning earphones. So be careful if you want to charge your iPhone and listen to wired music at the same time, it will not be possible unless you opt for the Apple doc at 60 euros or use a Bluetooth headset.Ios 10 is very fluid, the passage from one application to another is done without difficulty.Finally, I noticed that the sensor touch id is even faster, the identification of your borrows is instant.Je put a small star in less for the price high, the ip67 certification as well as for the 32 go non-expandable base. So it is a good device overall, even if the price is really too high compared to the competition.

2089	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	ellias	1	THAT SINKS WITH THIS SELLER WHO DOES NOT SELL THE NEW	2016-12-09	fr	Iphone 7 plus bought just a month ago for a fortune, it is a refurbished device given the problems: you type on the screen a sms, it suddenly opens an application, the battery is discharge in a few hours, so we must switch to battery saving mode, ie the same features as an Iphone 5. The screen remains frozen in panoramic mode, well, in short, the list is long ... When you contact the salesman you are told: "" address yourself to Apple "". Kind nothing to do with your fate after you have cheated.
2090	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Escriva Vincent	5	Just perfect	2017-07-13	fr	This iPhone is cheaper than the competition for a reason: it's an iPhone that comes from the countries of the east (the iPhone must be cheaper in these countries). The box is not French and the instructions either, but ultimately the iPhone is exactly the same as the one you could buy in France. So good for almost 200 euros difference is not serious.The iPhone is good NEW and not reconditioned. In short if everything works nickel, a beautiful beast. FYI I received the model A1784.Voila I specify for those who would wonder why the price is lower.
2091	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Victor-Jules Lefranc	3	Yeah	2018-01-20	fr	Well it's neither more nor less than an improved 6S, twice as expensive and much more perfected on the photographic level. Clearly my last purchase from Apple, I will not follow the affable delusions of the brand.
2092	iPhone 7 Plus	256GB	Black	The reviewer	4	Iphone 7 +: a very expensive phone	2016-09-26	fr	Apple likes to turn the output of each of its phones into a celebration and even if the Iphone 7 + (and 7) is not a revolutionary product, it remains a high-end smartphone and quality but very expensive: 1 ) At the format level, the 7 + is identical to the 6S +. It loses only 4 grams. It will obviously not be noticed in your pocket.2) The new A10 chip and IOS 10 bring a lot of comfort in terms of speed and ergonomics. Nothing revolutionary either but a very pleasant fluidity.3) It is waterproof with na standard IP67. It resists splashing (it can be dropped into the water), dust and shock. This is not luxury since an accident is quickly arrived.4) The implementation of a dual lens is really nice since we now get an optical zoom X2 and it is very useful when we go Massively serves his phone camera. See the test.5) More Jack Jack! For my part, I find it a shame but I think that eventually Apple will be right to remove this technology for the benefit of Bluetooth.6) Goodbye Home button! We get used to it quickly and indeed, it is consistent with the use of the fingerprint reader.7) The introduction of a stereo sound is a real plus with slots at the top and bottom of the phone . The sound quality is really there.8) The storage space has been revised upwards! Fortunately. Even if I am convinced that 32G, it is still a little short to take full advantage of his phone. Damage that the induction charging is still not integrated into the technology for Apple iPhone 7 ... To summarize, if you are an Apple lover, your current phone is failing / tired and you got a bonus at work, take this phone. Otherwise, you can wait without any concern for the following model that will create (what is said) a real evolution or the phone of a competing brand ... If you have questions and / or remarks, do not hesitate. hoping that it helps you in your choice:)

2202	iPhone 6S Plus	128GB	Space Gray	Alexis Neexxi	5	Still huge	2016-08-25	fr	I recently changed my iPhone 4S for a 6S plus 64G, and frankly I do not regret my purchase! I have a reading light, I read a lot, in the public transport, the evening at home, and since I have this model I no longer use the tablet. By cons do not hesitate to take the 64G below it is not enough it will fill quickly. Battery side, it's just a day (I use my phone a lot to surf, music, mail, calls, ...). But now complicated to find a smartphone that exceeds the day today .... Small negative point, for people with small hands it is a little closer to a mini tablet, for my part I manage to use it with one hand but if for the small hands to "" catch "" the corners must use both hands.On pay the price of quality Apple, but it's worth it! Finally, remember to protect it with a good good hull!

2204	iPhone 6S Plus	128GB	Space Gray	Michel-Lyon	5	5 stars for the product and the well deserved supplier ...	2016-10-16	fr	A very frankly speaking I have a Huawei P8 great but I am equipped mac ... when I finally received after only 48h his command, my iPhone 6s PLUS ouaw shocks (nice) I transfer tanquillou without any problem thanks to advice found on the page Apple my data from P8 to 6s more ... in the process I save my data through iTunes! The foot! What to say ? When you have an Apple computer system it makes sense to take an iPhone, natural complement of the system !!! I love my P8 for the price, the fact! --- but to save it under mac and even on my PC asus hard hard it is always missing something either it only backs up its contact numbers or you have to buy a software to make its backup and it is not said that if the next phone will be saved as well! In short even with Androïd files transfer I have trouble connecting to my P8! I just made some basic tests of the 6s PLUS bug it disrupts the slow motion of the video in super quality, the contacts that were recovered tip top or even better arranged and with the photos of my contacts, the clock that offers actions that were offered to me on android but with multiple apps ... In short, 654 € for the 6s PLUS 128GB I have for my money !! The product was a refurbished product and frankly I'm happy because I had headphones better than the original ones (flat cable instead of round like that of the charger whose tips are oversized) in short I can only give 5 star to this supplier, which is well deserved !!! I am not a tester and I have not been paid to say good (unlike some testers who are offered the product for testing, I am myself tester on my website but of course I only test the products I buy) !!!
2205	iPhone 6S Plus	128GB	Space Gray	Tricia	5	Excellent	2017-09-02	fr	At first, I was really scared of being fooled but I am very happy with my purchase. The iPhone 6S plus (128gigas) is very well arrived and very quickly (in two days). Once received I made all the necessary verifications to make sure that it is a real iPhone: there was indeed a blister to cover the box of the phone, the package perfectly matched that of Apple (Precision: on the back of the box, the info and features of the device were written in Spanish, not in French.) Ditto for the user manual provided inside the box, but this is no problem because the phone can be configured in any language). Once the box opened, the iPhone was covered with the plastic that Apple uses to cover its phones. The icing on the cake: there was all the Apple accessories (charger, cables and earphones) and the phone is under warranty Apple.Bref, I received an iPhone 6s Plus, gray sidereal, 128 gigas NEW (not reconditioned) for 200 € cheaper than at Apple. It's excellent. I recommend this seller, you can order with eyes closed.

2215	iPhone 6S Plus	128GB	Space Gray	Dune21	2	A great phone ... but who died after 10 days.	2019-06-28	fr	Bought new from Amazon, my iPhone 6S Plus has died for no reason after a dozen days - impossible to restart it, more load possible, black screen and no restart possible. Apple did not know what to offer except to send the phone for repair (75km from home, so 150 round trip), so I sent it back to Amazon. Now I'm waiting for the refund from Amazon, which takes 10 days worked (so for them, 15 days) from the date of receipt of the package. For 499 euros, it's a somewhat disappointing experience, even painful, I do not know if there was a better way to find a new phone, now I'm without phone> _ <. The few 10 days during which j I was able to enjoy the phone, it seemed very well designed, perfect ergonomics, impression of power very correct for my use, its only defect compared to current phones is in my opinion at the level of sound (mono, a little too much in the treble, not very nice to listen to music or watch a movie). I only made a few pictures, but they looked good, clearly above the old iPhone. To put in perspective for the most advanced users because I am not a "" power user "" (no games, no gourmet apps, no 4K video), I did not notice any particular weakness. it is a phone that is not at the forefront of technology, but is very nice to use for those who do not want to complicate life, like a Mercedes automatic that would have 100 or 200,000 km. The price (nine) is in my opinion too high for the technology.
2216	iPhone 6S Plus	32GB	Argent	Client d'Amazon	5	Sold Refurbished - Newly received!	2019-06-19	fr	I ordered the phone as a birthday present given the prices of new iphones more and more reserved for "elite". I chose to take as an Amazon seller because at least the warranty seems more serious than other sellers. Many comments said to have received a new iPhone, I told myself that the repackaging was identical to the new so to offer it would be great. So I let myself try. The received phone (iPhone 6s Plus 32GB sidereal gray) is actually new! I do not understand how it is possible but it is the case and I know about the iPhone for 8 years always bought new. Original blister, new accessories, 100% battery status. I recommend +++

4096	iPhone XS	256GB	Gray	Massimo e Katia	5	"Almost perfect!	2018-10-17	it	Let's take a quick look at the main strengths and weaknesses of this phone, the latest from Apple, without paying too much attention to cold numbers but, above all, to everyday use. Let's start with what I didn't like: - Weight. Yeah, the history of the rear glass to allow wireless charging has increased the bulk and you can hear it in your pocket, even in your hand it doesn't go unnoticed, but you get used to it.-The camera has a protruding traffic light. Bruttina to see makes the dancer device if placed flat on the back.-The "Notch 1". Staying on the cleat is invasive, especially if you watch videos or if the apps are not optimized, then off that portion of the display and many greetings to the big screen. - The "Notch 2". And here we go again! The diabolical black stripe that still combines us? Reduces the space for system icons in the upper part ... do you want to see the battery percentage, if the bt is on, if a vpn is active, the name of the operator, etc.? Well, every once in a while you will have to pull down the drop-down menu, the one for the "quick" settings to understand. She looks stupid, but in everyday use it's a nice break! Bad! -The remaining battery percentage. I know, I repeat, excuse me! But what the hell did it take to insert it inside the special icon? Bah! - The battery. Ok, who has had an iPhone is used to it, with intense use you don't get there in the evening, you know. But the story that on the new Iphone lasts the most is stupid. The screen oled sucks, even if there was a difference you wouldn't even notice ...- Siri. Nothing ... despite the shortcuts we are still light years away from the Google assistant. - Le animoji and the memoji. Now, with all due respect ... but what really? Or are you a 6 year old child or what would be the utility? Make you pass for a fool even during messages and video calls? What then at least save us the presentations of the river of ste ca ... stupid! -The processor. An exaggerated power even for a PC. But what are you doing with cell phones ??? If you don't plan to design Dubai's next mall or walk around like zombies for VR games, all power is absolutely useless. Marketing, point. The average user of the "very good" on Facebook and the photo of the cutlet on Instagram what should you do with it?.If you hear a crack and you hope it is the knee rather than the phone, obviously, there is a problem! -It is not 5g. Here too ... Apple we know ... of course they could have been wasted for once. Instead, guess what? No predisposition for the 5g that should arrive in 2020 in Italy. And in two years if you want to use the new band, ooops, it's up to upgrade to the new model. - The physical keys. Now the power button calls up Siri, to turn off the phone you have to simultaneously press the minus volume key and the power key, for the screenshots plus volume key and power key. Uncomfortable. - No lightning adapter / headphone jack in the package. If you want it, you pay for it separately, as does the quick charger. Tirchioni! -Do not justify the upgrade from X, few novelties and not unavoidableWhat I liked: -The processor. I know, I contradict myself, but hell! It's a splinter!

4098	iPhone XS	64GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	3	iPhone XS problema antenna	2018-11-03	it	Antenna problems. I strongly advise against this if you have poor 3G / 4G or LTE signal reception. This is because the iPhone XS antennas have weaker reception than the data signal. It has a weaker reception than my old iPhone 5s (with this the signal is much stronger and more stable). With what it cost it had to be perfect. The IOS 12.1 software update has not solved the problem of signal strength and power.
4099	iPhone XS	64GB	Argent 	Stefano Bettoni	5	what to say Perfect	2019-05-14	it	Excellent product in perfect condition. At the beginning I was very skeptical about buying a smartphone here, but in the end I changed my mind. The package arrived perfectly on time and in perfect condition I couldn't ask for anything better. I am an iPhone expert by now having the iPhone by 7 years and I have to say that this latest model is a bomb both in terms of aesthetics and powerI make it hard to discharge it using it almost all dayNo it never crashes! The photos are perfect and my girlfriend is crazy about it (I am now a ph) And the Face ID is really instant. Purchase highly recommended for all iPhone lovers!
4100	iPhone XS	256GB	Gray	Patrick	5	Perfect!	2018-11-10	it	There is not much to say about an Apple product. He found it absolutely perfect: very fast, amazing photos, beautiful materials etc. If I have to find fault with him, know that it is quite heavy, under stress it warms up a bit (nothing anyway) and sometimes, it takes a moment to load the contents of a page (I think they will solve it with subsequent updates). Apart from that, for me it's the top! The merchant Amazon is really professional!
4101	iPhone XS	256GB	Gray	Leonardo	2	Iphone Xs with aesthetic defect	2019-05-03	it	I state that Amazon is and will remain synonymous with guarantee for me even after this experience. Unfortunately I find myself making this negative review for the following reasons: I purchased an iphone Xs 256 GB gray sidereal about 10 days ago. The smartphone will arrive on the day and without even turning it on, I apply a previously purchased protection film. I configure the phone restoring my backup and migrating all the main applications, losing half a day. The day after the purchase, handling the phone, I notice a kind of bulge / draft in the upper right part of the iphone. I call support, explaining what I found and promptly sent me a new phone (I love Amazon for this). I put the phone back in its packaging and after a few days of waiting I get the new phone. Same scheme: as soon as I open I apply a New film ( repurchased) to the new smartphone. I put more than half a day to reconfigure everything and reset the first smartphone to make the return. After doing everything, convinced to be okay, I look at the phone and I realize that the new one has the same defect (see photo). from a smartphone costing more than 1200 euros you expect perfection, and instead ... I decided to keep it anyway, because I can't lose other days between backup / restore and mail waiting for the return. However I feel very dissatisfied and above all disappointed for Amazon and Apple (I wonder where is the quality control?) I take this opportunity to ask a question to those who maybe know more than me: but can such a defect affect the physical characteristics? (impact resistance).
4102	iPhone XS	256GB	Gray	Martina	4	Too bad for the battery :(	2019-01-19	it	Perfect delivery! On the product nothing to say, I made the return because the battery had problems and because being a gift for my mother was too "complex": after a day of use had a percentage already reduced by 15%. Impeccable Amazon assistance, I will buy a lower model just for the convenience of the gift recipient!

4106	iPhone XS	64GB	Argent 	Aurora	4	Only flaw in the packaging	2019-06-26	it	I give 4 stars exclusively for packaging, in my opinion, not adequate. The terminal is fantastic, as every Apple product and aesthetically looks very well; the camera generates shots comparable to a camera; the battery life is almost good but, with intense use, it is difficult to arrive in the evening. As for shipping, it was very precise; the only flaw is the packaging which was not very adequate since there were no cushioning air bearings and, given the high cost of the device, it would have been appropriate to insert them.
4107	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Andrea & Giovanna	5	A whole other world	2019-01-20	it	It is true that it costs a lot of iPhone XS but it is a whole other world. Perfect product arrived in its original box wrapped in its film

4148	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Guglielmo Novaglio	5	Apple always but you can see the limits ...	2019-01-20	it	I am always an Apple customer. The model that most surprised me was the 5S. Then I switched to 6S and even there you have to say my skepticism was largely denied. I stopped and recently gave this XS. Nothing to say in terms of quality but honestly I understand why the sales of the iPhone communicate to accuse some crisis. Shooting until evening without having to top up. I forgot the use of the powerbank. Against: Weigh !!! Compared to iPhone 6S and 6 S plus it seems to be sealed. A few months later I have to say that I'm not used to it. Every time I pick up the 6S from this point of view it is a regret (it hadn't happened to me before I didn't adapt). For the rest, the absence of the home button gets you used to it very quickly. Face ID cute but nothing shocking . The rest is optimized and improved without substantial newness. If they continue to apply these price policies honestly, I don't really think that I actually cost too much. They hadn't given me a gift I would have kept the 6S for a while longer without it problems. Now if I had to go back I would have some discomfort.
4149	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Nicola83	5	Great smartphone	2019-01-04	it	Great product, Apple manages to put elegance and performance always united in a product in my opinion unique ... it has a very good bright screen that allows a good vision even in the sun, the camera offers many possibilities and good performance and the phone in general is very fast as Apple has always accustomed us. The price is a bit high but after all Apple has always had high prices and this year gives the possibility to buy products even at lower prices like iPhone XR which is an equally valid and performance device with a very high battery life. Product I recommend.!
4150	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	AleM	3	The lightest S update in the history of the iPhone	2018-12-12	it	It is an X with some improvements (eg processor and camera) but without any real news, unlike 4S which had added Siri, 5s which had added Touch ID and 6s that had added the 3D Touch.
4151	iPhone XS	256GB	Gray	Alfred	5	Spectacular smartphone	2018-12-17	it	A leap forward compared to the already stunning X, lightning-fast in reactivity, excellent photographic compartment, bright display and with a perfect definition of colors.

"", When it arrived the product actually looked like new, without the slightest scratch, fluid software and undamaged battery. that the Face ID worked, pity though that browsing in the various features I found that the Animoji function did not work, oh well I could also fly over because I find it not very useful, BUT the most serious problem is the malfunction of the "portrait" mode of the iPhone , initially with the rear camera I hadn't noticed, thinking it was me who hadn't set something, but as soon as I switched to the front camera, the image became fuzzy (as shown in the image attached to the review). Contact Apple immediately, the which, following a diagnosis, detects a malfunction in the TrueDepth camera (then Animoji and mode "" portrait ""). I will return the A-device as soon as possible mazon.

4165	iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Alejandro	4	Is it worth buying it?	2018-10-20	it	* UPDATED * I purchased this new iPhone on the Apple Store online, just to try it out a little, having already an iPhone X; personally, I don't think it's worth buying, if you already have an iPhone X. This is the much-anticipated version "" S "" of the iPhone X. Let's try to understand what changes compared to the previous version and whether it's worth buying or not . Let's start by saying that there are NO big changes compared to the previous device. No news is resounding this year. The S version, as is well known, only goes to improve some aspects. Moreover, unusually, the most expensive and large "" Xs Max "" version has nothing different than the iPhone Xs, except for its size. We do not find more powerful processors or improved cameras. It's just a bigger iPhone Xs with more battery (and power consumption). I will continue to update this review as I use it. DESIGN: The iPhone Xs does not bring significant changes in design, except in the lower part where the symmetry of the holes, having added an additional antenna, to allow an enhanced reception, also given the novelty of the Dual Sim, which will be discussed later. The rear camera has been moved slightly a few millimeters higher, so the covers of the iPhone X will NOT be fully compatible with the new device. This year we also have the Gold variant. The design remains essentially unchanged, this device achieves an IP68 waterproof rating (6 indicates the maximum degree of dust resistance and 8 indicates a degree of impermeability and resistance , in case of contact with liquids, but especially with fresh water, for 30 minutes and a maximum of 2 meters deep). The guarantee of NO manufacturer, recognizes the damage caused by liquids, so it is better to refer to these specifications, considering ONLY soft water, being the liquid that causes less damage. The resistance to water and dust decreases with 'usury.PROCESSOR: The new iPhone Xs features the brand new Bionic A12 processor (retains the same marketing name as the previous A11 Bionic), but is the first smartphone processor to be built at 7 nanometers. It is equipped with 4GB of RAM, compared to the 3GB of the iPhone X, it is always equipped with 6 cores (2 high-performance and 4 high-efficiency), it has a second-generation neural engine (8-core) capable of performing 5000 billions of transactions in a second (against the 600 billion of the A11). The GPU is designed by Apple and has 4 cores against the 3 of the X. The 2 high-efficiency cores are dedicated to everyday operations, such as social media, apps, games. The 4 high-efficiency devices, on the other hand, are designed to save battery power when performing simpler operations such as chats and messages. However, when all the processor power is needed, iOS dynamically calibrates all six cores to deliver incredible performance (same as iPhone X). Thus, while performing heavy apps, such as augmented reality games or video editing, performance will be greatly improved. I do not find significant changes during everyday use compared to X. Probably, it also depends on the new operating system (iOS 12) not yet fully optimized on this new device. Both are very fast in all operations: multitasking, photos and videos, opening the app and, of course, in games .. BATTERY: Rightly, one wonders given the performance, the battery capacity. iPhone Xs is equipped with a 2658mAh battery (against the 2716mAh of iPhone X); iPhone Xs Max, on the other hand, has the largest battery an iPhone has ever had, that is 3174mAh (against the 2691mAh of the iPhone 8 Plus). iPhone Xs has less battery than iPhone X? Yes. Does it last less? At the moment, I have to say that the duration is a little lower than X, but I also think this depends on the software. FACE ID AND CAMERA: As I wrote above, the cameras are the same as the iPhone X, always with wide angle and telephoto lens with aperture focal length of ƒ / 1.8 and ƒ / 2 respectively.4. Despite this, Apple has added some features on the new Xs / Xs Max, in my opinion, for pure marketing. In fact, both these models (but also the new Xr, with single camera, released at the end of October) are able to adjust the depth of field of a photo both before shooting and in post-production and have an advanced bokeh effect . These effects are also possible on the iPhone X via the Focos app, since the cameras are identical. Change the quality of the photos in low light for the better, since the sensor of the camera has larger pixels and, we also have the smartHDR that goes to perform more shots of the same subject, combining the best parts of each shot as a result (light, movement reduction, colors); according to Apple, this, the depth of field and the boken effect are possible thanks to the new processor able to perform more operations. Nothing that the processor of the iPhone X is not able to do, but anyway .. Even the sensors of the Face ID are identical to those of the previous model, but Apple reports an improvement in the algorithm of the Secure Enclave (separate processor to encrypt biometric passwords) which guarantees a faster unlocking, despite not being a second generation Face ID. Honestly, the speed seems to me to be the same as the iPhone X, which thanks to iOS 12 is even faster and more precise in unlocking. I am absolutely satisfied in this sense.DUAL SIM: We pay attention to this very important detail. The 3 new iPhones will NOT have Dual Sim functionality in Italy. This is because it is not possible to insert 2 physical Nano Sims, since the trolley can contain only one physics, unlike the version intended for the Chinese market that will have two. How does this system work? A sim will be physical, the second sim, instead, will be based on the "" Dual Sim Dual Standby "" technology that allows you to simulate the second sim in a virtual way. This is the future, as this system will make it very easy to change the telephone or operator offer. Unfortunately, at the moment, no operator in Italy allows this function. Probably Vodafone will be the first to catch up with this technology, but not for now (the function has however been enabled by Apple with the version of iOS 12.1). Certainly it will take a few years, as has already happened with the LTE feature of the Apple Watch Series 3, arrived in Italy after about a year (Apple Watch Series 4) and supported solely by Vodafone. We will see future developments. CURRENTLY CORRECTED DEFECTS: If you have heard of the ChargeGate, know that it has been resolved with iOS 12.0.1 (it did not allow recharging, if the screen was off). According to some users, there is still a Beauty Gate that applies a sort of "" beauty filter "" automatically to selfies; in this way, the details of the face will be minimally captured, making the face look like that of a barbie. It seems to have been a bug that has just been solved with iOS 12.1. Some users also complain about an Antenna Gate, especially on the Xs Max, with poor reception in 4G / LTE and in WiFi. The WiFi part was resolved with 12.0.1, while the part concerning the antenna was solved with iOS 12.1. Obviously, in the event that this last problem occurs, Apple will replace the device, free of charge. I hope I helped you with the decision or clarified your ideas. If you have any other questions, please write me in the comments! :)

4182	iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	Filippo	4	Great phone but expensive	2019-02-11	it	After a couple of months I am here to review the iPhone XS Max. I have many things to tell you so I will proceed by points in a more schematic way. Designs my high-level opinion, nothing particularly different from last year's X. XS Max simply adds just over half an inch to the screen. It is noticeable however a lot but the device is still able to be used with one hand only even if I have to admit it, we are at the limit (and I don't have a small hand). In any case, the overall dimensions are approximately that of 8 plus, only the edges are smaller. As materials nothing to say, unexceptionable, glass and metal everywhere. Overall 9 / 10Excellent Performance from this point of view, with Geekbench I totaled 11200 points or so in multi-core and 4700 in single-core. Therefore unexceptionable despite having less core than the competition. The software as always is well optimized. Battery The battery has surprised me in positive, I come from an 8 plus with which I could easily do a day and a half in Wi-Fi / 4g without stressing it too much, with the XS Max the duration is not all the lower. For the rest it goes like all latest-generation iPhones, always fluid and reliable software, does what it has to do and does it well. Is this worth spending over 1000 euros to get it? Then spend a little bit more and take this with respect to the XS there is, it has a longer battery life (significantly I assure you) and a bigger screen (for those who don't mind). Compared to other similar devices it is possible to spend a lot less having a valid terminal anyway so if you don't feel like spending more than 1k you can also orientate yourself to a very valid XR, or sacrifice iOS and turn to the Android competition. Here the quality is certainly at the highest levels but not entirely commensurate with the price, for this I give 4 stars.

4185	iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	Alejandro	4	Is it worth buying it?	2018-10-20	it	* UPDATED * I purchased this new iPhone on the Apple Store online, just to try it out a little, having already an iPhone X; personally, I don't think it's worth buying, if you already have an iPhone X. This is the much-anticipated version "" S "" of the iPhone X. Let's try to understand what changes compared to the previous version and whether it's worth buying or not . Let's start by saying that there are NO big changes compared to the previous device. No news is resounding this year. The S version, as is well known, only goes to improve some aspects. Moreover, unusually, the most expensive and large "" Xs Max "" version has nothing different than the iPhone Xs, except for its size. We do not find more powerful processors or improved cameras. It's just a bigger iPhone Xs with more battery (and power consumption). I will continue to update this review as I use it. DESIGN: The iPhone Xs does not bring significant changes in design, except in the lower part where the symmetry of the holes, having added an additional antenna, to allow an enhanced reception, also given the novelty of the Dual Sim, which will be discussed later.

4186	iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	Federico	1	He stopped going after less than a month.	2018-11-05	it	Received as a gift 20 days ago. 10 years I have Apple phones. Extraordinary (even if it's not worth € 1200) until, from nothing, I touch it on the bedside table and feel it boiling. It is off and does not turn on. The phone was not charging and I had used the hotspot up to 10 minutes earlier. I try to cool it, even with water (I know it's waterproof), but it continues to heat up. Nothing, it has never turned on again. Official Apple "impeccable" assistance: they will receive me BETWEEN ONE WEEK. I am disappointed for the umpteenth time by a company that, since Steve is gone, guesses one every five.
4187	iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	Mr Tech	5	The top of smartphones	2019-06-30	it	Taken here on Amazon saw the lower price and then because the Amazon warranty is at the top. The product is naturally new and original and works great. I had a 7 plus changed only for the excessive size. I must say that there is a difference in performance. The camera has taken a giant step especially for night shots. For me it's the top of smartphones
4188	iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	redalex	5	I have it from 256	2019-05-27	it	An expensive product that I didn't buy on Amazon, unfortunately, I had lost my old 6 ..... But already being waterproof means a lot, the stability is unique, then I notice other brands that shoot mega pixels like laughing and if yes compare the photos, the Apple gives better results .. It is expensive, but when they print the electronic components, they come out with different qualities, Apple uses the choice for example a B12 processor can be of 3 choice, on the invoice mold etc. but on apple they try to test them one by one. I would have liked with the fingerprint in the back on the Apple and with the sensors adaptable to all the TVs ... Too bad for the 6 lost I would have preferred it still in front of the android ..
4189	iPhone XS	64GB	Gray	Sofbul	5	Awesome	2019-04-23	it	It's an i-phone! Easy, intuitive, with performance that offers you it is normal that the battery does not last long. For me it is the best smartphone on the market
4190	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Gray	MK	5	Size matters!	2018-12-30	it	Please forgive the bad double meaning in the title, I could not resist, but as you will understand by reading my review, the real feature that distinguishes Iphone Xs Max from the Xs is mainly this, and is perhaps also the only noteworthy one. Let's start with a premise. Despite not being a kangaroo, in the summer, I have to go around with the baby carrier. I'll explain. Keys to the home, office, car, personal cell phone, work cell phone, cigarettes (seriously harms health, ed), earphones ... I don't know where to put the stuff anymore. Another tragedy of biblical proportions, somewhat unusual, is that my partner does not like to go around with the bag, so I can also forget the classic "Love, can't you keep me 2 tons of junk?". Now let's imagine if I can afford a device that measures the beauty of almost 16 cm in height and almost 8 in width ... more covers. Come on, it's a frying pan, let's face it. Don't get me wrong, it's not always bad, but you have to deal with the clutter. For the rest Xs and Xs Max have common strengths and weaknesses, let's examine them together. Let's start from the latter. -The notch. By dint of talking badly about it alive in fear of finding it under my house with a bat in my hand. But I can't fail, it's stronger than me. The wonderful black cleat stuffed with equally wonderful and ultra-technological sensors is always in the middle of the boxes. First it takes away a portion of the screen, so photos, videos, applications will be cut or you will have a creepy dark hunchback that invades the display. Secondly it takes away space from the icons. Do you want to check the remaining battery percentage? Down the drop-down menu! Will the Bluetooth be turned on? Down the drop-down menu! What operator am I connected to? Down the drop-down menu! Is it a phone or a roller shutter? Guys, they took it out this year. The quality is not discussed, and that is paid, you know, but this Max is out of place. Much of the price is bitten melina. It is equally true that no one forces us to buy it and that, with their own money, everyone does what he wants. - The name. Iphone Xs Max. Ok, the question is negligible, I agree, but it still seems ridiculous to me.-The processor. Someone is kind enough to explain to me what you do with a phone that has a processor that could handle a shuttle? Virtual reality is still embryonic, the games don't even comment on them, saving a few thousandths of a second in posting the photo of the schnitzel with ginger sauce, on a bed of rocket, with a side of Jerusalem artichoke and sprinkle of balsamic vinegar on Instagram? But eating that gets cold, no ??? It looks ugly. What then, just enter a public office and throw away half a day, eh but the phone must be a splinter ...- The physical keys.Now the power button calls up Siri, to turn off the phone you have to simultaneously press the minus volume key and the power key, for the screenshots plus volume key and power key. Scomodo.-Siri. Nothing ... despite the shortcuts we are still light years away from the Google assistant. - No hole for the headphones and no jack / lightning adapter in the package. They risked financial ruin for the latter. - Animoji and memoji. Now, with all due respect ... but what really? Or are you a 6 year old child or what would be the utility? Make you pass for a fool even during messages and video calls? What then at least save us the presentations of the river of ste ca ... stupid! -The camera. Protruding. Ugly, at greater risk of bumps and uncomfortable. The device, if placed on its back on the back, will inevitably sway and go to the macarena. Good for lovers of Jennifer Lopez, but to me the Latin American dances suck ... also because I have the movements of a bedside table ... of Ikea ... broken ...- Battery. It has never been one of the strong points of Apple products and neither is it in this case. Slightly better than the Xs but slightly worse than the Xr. You can make it a busy day. But it doesn't advance much. -Size.Here we are. It is not a featherweight, difficult to use with one hand, the reachability function helps. In summer, if you make a long call, you will have a fantastic spot of pan on your face, complete with a bitten apple in relief. Call in the shade! It is a function to avoid melanoma. Oled from 6.5 against 5.8 of Xs. Only and only difference between the top of the range of this year. Pray.-Dimensions. Cross and delight. But do you want to show a film on such a generous display? A show also with photos. Exceptional with every light condition! 6.5 inches of pure visual perfection! If only it made me look younger it would be perfect. Instead nothing. -Face-Id is foolproof and very fast, even with sunglasses or little light zero problems. If he recognizes my big face just awake, he can recognize anyone, trust me! -Dual Sim. The new iPhones introduce dual SIM functionality into the Apple ecosystem. Which as usual does in its own way: the second card must be digital (eSIM), a format still very little popular in Italy. Too much effort to put the double slot like in China, on the other hand the phone is small ...- Photographic compartment. Difficult to get a bad photo, flawless bokeh effect. Even if you are not a professional, the results will amaze you. Video on the same level. Far beyond the normal needs of a non-professional user. -The processor. But how? Didn't you say that it was an exaggeration, that from here, that from there .... but you have to come and do the picky right here? Phew ... where did we stay before you interrupted me? Ah yes, the processor. Never a lag, never an uncertainty, always fluid, in every situation. Using this Xs Max is a pleasure. Always. With all due respect to my considerations set out between the defects and my consistency. -Audio. Greatly improved compared to previous generations. So much better that if you have Gigi D’Alessio songs in the playlists, they will be automatically deleted. - Build quality. It is an iPhone and you can hear it. Manic as always. With what it costs ... God forbid! - Hardware / software integration always at the top. It is a reliable and simple travel companion in its daily use, you will never have to make too many concussions to keep it in perfect shape. - The Apple ecosystem, closed but at the same time so reassuring, and continuous updates. store.-reception. Bt, cell phone and wifi. Never encountered a problem on the models in my possession. Connections always stable and fast. It may seem silly but ... everything works well! Certainly there are some defects, I have listed them above, but believe me, once you have this concentration of technology in hand, they will pass into the background. Basically, if you are looking for a device with a "big screen" and if bulky size and price are not a problem, you have found what is right for you. You could easily read these few lines and save yourself the rambling above. I think that tomorrow I will have to look good before crossing the road ... And the time has come for excuses. I apologize for some copy / paste too much with my Xs rece, but guys, they are the same, by now you will understand what changes ... so it's not my fault but Apple's. I also apologize to the fans of Gigi D'Alessio, Jennifer Lopez, lovers of Latin-American dances, Ikea, Apple, kangaroos, public offices, bedside tables, frying pans and cutlet. Just kidding. Maybe. With the "Notch" I do not apologize, with the one just not! I hope I snatched a smile from you and I don't know how, by rereading the review, you have been useful. What a delirium ...
4191	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Gray	Lorenzo F.	5	Fast and unmatched screen.	2019-01-08	it	I, as owner of the iPhone X, thought I couldn't find big differences and instead once I tried this I had to change my mind, I can't go back! Starting from the battery with excellent durability, crystal-clear screen and impressive speed. The camera takes great photos even in the dark. Consider that it is so comfortable and beautiful that you can safely use it to watch videos or movies without needing a computer. Also known improvements in the Wi-Fi sector. I hope I have been useful.

4194	iPhone XS Max	512GB	Gray	Studio Thomas Wiedenhofer	5	The top of the top at a very discounted price	2019-04-17	it	You just need to say the best mobile on the market! I went from my faithful iphone 6s to this. The difference is remarkable for everything. Now I have been using it for 1 week and I have only had positive experiences one after the other! - Impressive battery life: after 1 day of regular use (about 3 hours of use between phone calls, mail, social media and a few games) I there was still a poor 50/100 charge! - The wireless charge fantastic although not very fast, since apple limits it to 7.5W (suppponge choice to optimize battery life) .- A fantastic OLED screen! I compared it with the Xr version with the LCD technology screen and I guarantee you a noticeable difference! An impressive sharpness! - The camera then beats all the competitors: not so much for megapixels, which now chases them to the maximum number wins the competition <- but think about the size of the sensor: better than the beautiful pixels defined and "" large "" rather than having double "" tiny "" and poorly detailed pixels. - Where it really wins with photography, it is the chromatic interpretation, the mood, the image, that is, how it converts the phone to the data recorded in the image. Li the apple has a gear always better! - The size of the Xs Max is to get used if you come from a smaller cell phone, but no problem. - The only flaw is that it costs a lot! but it is a good investment if you have to work with your mobile phone for several reasons: 1) it maintains a good resale value2) it does not freeze to some degree below zero (as just seen with a friend in the mountains who his P20pro at -6 does not it worked the most and the iPhone continued quiet3) truly remarkable autonomy4) the 512Gb version has room for everything we need for the next 5 years5) screen resolution 2688 × 1242 pixels at 458 ppi, Contrast 1,000,000: 1 and HDR = WOWBUONA CHOICE .... even if you can't choose ... you can take it and celebrate it

4200	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	Lorenzo Ciocio	5	The best Iphone ever.	2019-03-27	it	The hardware of this XS Max you have never disappointed me, indeed after 6 months it continues to amaze me. the brand new 7nm Apple A12 Bionic processor with 6 cores and a new 4 core GPU. In addition, the 8-core Neural Engine processor helps the phone consume less, I can get to the end of the day quietly with more than 30%, despite the use of stress. We then have 4 GB of RAM and various memory cuts: 64, 256 and 512 GB not expandable, I bought the 64 GB model and I never had any memory problems, also thanks to the cloud system. Do not miss the LTE Gigabit, dual band Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 5.0 and NFC for Apple Pay. In addition we have a new Face ID for unlocking the truly lightning-fast 3D face: so fast you will forget about its existence, it can recognize me in every situation, from darkness to the strongest light. On the left side we find the usual comfortable switch for the ringtone and also in this XS Max we have dual SIM support, with a nanoSIM and an eSIM, currently not yet available in Italy. I HIGHLY recommend it.

4231	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Gray	Nicola83	4	Nice, big and fast but expensive	2019-02-06	it	High-quality smartphones, Apple has integrated all the best of current technology to create a performing product in all aspects. The aesthetic is very elegant, as always Apple has accustomed us, the screen is the largest of all the other iPhone and the battery has a good duration. The screen has bright colors and the camera allows you to take high quality shots with various effects. The price is very high and I recommend the purchase to users who fully utilize its functions, alternatively Apple has released models such as iPhone XR which has almost equal XS pressure but at more moderate prices.

What can I say, perfection made smartphone !!

4241	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	Vitus	5	iPhone x	2019-04-14	it	Fantastic
4242	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	Alexander	5	iPhone all life	2019-01-11	it	I have no words to describe the magnificence of this product. The reliability of the Apple brand is at the highest levels. In this new iPhone XS Max the facial recognition is much faster and more reliable than in the past (the old iphone X didn't recognize me as easily), more fluid in use and the battery is really a bomb. With the supplied charger (from 5 watts) the recharging cycle really lasts 3h and 40 min. The device, however, is equipped with fast recharging if you have a suitable charger, in that case, you will be able to halve the recharge time (you can use that of an ipad for example). With an average use of the iPhone you will be able to make the battery last up to the evening with a residue of even 30/40%, but this depends on the use you make of it. I must stress that the duration is absolutely great long superior to the other previous models. The gold color is elegant and sober at the same time. I hope there are no future hardware problems like in my old iphone x. Product absolutely recommended, Amazon price lower than the market. The only flaw that I tend to highlight at the moment is Apple's decision to remove the connector from lightning to Aux that was previously supplied, marketing choices that, as usual, leave us a bit perplexed. You can buy it separately at a cost of € 10 always here on Amazon (it is not such an exorbitant amount). Purchased € 1098.00 in December 2018 in the 64 Gb format. Accorrete, the wonderful world of the apple is waiting for you;)
4243	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Gray	cesare romano	5	All right	2019-01-06	it	I need a little more time to fully judge the qualities of this phone. At the moment (I come from the iPhone 7plus) the qualitative leap is evident. In terms of speed and practicality it is a step forward. I thought I suffered more from the lack of the home button, but it didn't take long for me to get used to the new app management method. Good purchase for now

4261	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Massimo e Katia	4	The most balanced, price apart!	2018-12-03	it	As my habit we will look in detail not so much at the strictly technical data, but at the usability of the telephone in everyday life. This Xr has the same processor as its bigger brothers, which, together with the operating system, make it one of the most fluid and performing phones on the market. But all that glitters is not gold. In fact the bad word benchmarks give him slower than his colleagues in multicore. Will we notice it in everyday life? If you are planning the new Sistine chapel, you probably are. Otherwise No, so let's forget about the multicore and the benchmark. The camera. Now ... I understand that somehow it had to be differentiated from the other models, but was there really a need to remove a module? Oh well, however the single lens is performing, the photos are good in all light conditions, but the comparison with X, or with the previous model does not hold, let alone with the most current ones. It remains an excellent camera able to give satisfaction even to the less practical user and the portrait and depth mode functions remain, albeit with some marginal differences for the average user. Aren't you making the new Pirelli calendar? Well, then I don't see big issues on the horizon. The dimensions. We're halfway there, if the Xs Max (which the hell of a name) is a little annoying in the hand, this Xr meets the needs of those who want a greater screen diagonal, but without compromising its usability too much. Even the lesser weight helps from this point of view. Not every time we will be able to use it with one hand, but we get very close. The display. It's not Oled, but can you tell? Purpose Who. The LCD is sharp and looks good even with direct light, it's great for watching our favorite TV series or a movie, without the slightest problem. Do we really need something more? 3D Touch is missing, true, but in principle we live well without it. And here, reconnecting to the subject of the screen, not having an Oled helps, in fact among all the Iphone is the one that will arrive more easily in the evening. You want to put not carry cables, powerbanks, power supplies, and so on and so forth. Really, it surprised me. In this case a great job was done! Materials. Only the frame changes, here we have aluminum instead of stainless steel. Unless you are the heck of geologists ... Then most of us put them in improbable cases, so the greater delicacy of the Xr is not a serious discriminator.Cellular connectivity. In my personal opinion, here we find the magagnone. Nobody gives you anything. All new models have an Intel 4g modem, but the most expensive have 4x4 Mimo antennas against the 2x4 mime of the "cheapest". Translated: a theoretical maximum speed reduced to half, 400 against 200 Mbps. Perhaps we won't notice it because Italian operators rarely reach such speeds, except in big cities, but it's good to know. Colors. The Xr has many colors available. For those interested in aesthetics can indulge themselves. Beautiful, but then we put them in the aforementioned cases, so ... Water resistance IP68 for Ls Xs and Max and Ip67 for Xr, or only splashes of water for the latter. If you don't have the habit of dropping it in the toilet and flushing it out, you should go easy. The substantial differences end here in my opinion. In some passages I have defined this device as "economic", but let's face it, this voluntarily quoted word has very little meaning. iPhone Xr costs ... and a lot. At a lower price there are Android phones that offer much more on paper. It's a personal matter, Apple gives you security and has become a fetish for many. Still it remains one of the simplest terminals to use and less problematic in the daily management. Also keep the constant and lasting updates over time combined with top technical assistance, the picture is complete. A matter of taste and ... wallet. Few really need anything more in terms of performance, and if you want to spend a little less, you will find a great phone in your hands. Separate speech for the famous "notch" that I continue to find uncomfortable and intrusive for a series of reasons that I have explained in my Xs rece. I hope, at least in part, to have helped you in your choice.
4262	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	🇮🇹 Schälflj 🇮🇹	4	A balanced terminal, but why did it NOT fully convince me? Iphone XR or X?	2019-01-21	it	Given that in the family we have other iPhones, a 6S and an X, we have decided to also buy the latest XR, taking advantage of the fact that Amazon also sells Apple products directly. Purchased in BLACK color, sold and shipped from Amazon at 759.05 euro in December 2018. Leaving aside the technical features of this XR now available everywhere, let's move on to my feelings of use at a distance of a month. the iPhone arrives in the usual classic Apple box, but this time, unlike the X model, we find only the HEADPHONES with LIGHTNING plug and unfortunately no ADAPTER (cost 10 euro on the market, so why not enter it). THE CHARGING FEEDER is always the same, if we want one fast or we already have it or buy it separately. CONFIGURATION of the phone is very fast, especially if you already have another iPhone and we are in the hands of the new terminal ready for use in a few minutes. The SCREEN is criticized by m also because it would only be an LCD, frankly it does NOT make me scream in scandal, nor do the thicker FRAMES, almost inevitable given the type of screen. If you then choose the dark color, you may not even notice all these thick frames. Sincerely, compared to the iPhone X this LCD of the XR is not at all out of place, certainly it will have something less, but at times I appreciate it even more of the OLED, above all on the shade of the WHITE, perhaps less on the NERI. Even in the open air, under the light of the SUN I have not found particular problems of visibility for this screen. The FACE ID is excellent, it does not lose a stroke in every condition of light and I would say from almost every position, except for some sporadic cases; it is enough just to install it to register your face TWO times as the phone asks. The AUDIO of this XR, for phone calls as for listening to videos, I find it good, as well as the reception of the telephone signal and 4G; no problem even for WiFi reception and fast switching between WiFi and 4G, at least under the Vodafone network. FLUIDITY of use of the phone is good, thanks to the new processor, I have not found slowdowns or significant blocks. it has improved compared to other iPhones, something more than the X, simply perhaps because the battery is bigger / more powerful and the LCD screen asks for less energy than the OLED. In this, Apple technicians were really good. With average use, you can easily get to the night with a good 30% of the remaining charge. So everything is fine here, so why didn't the phone completely convince me? I personally try to keep the phones I use in exemplary conditions and as far as possible I try to avoid damage of any kind, so purchase cases and protective glasses. Once the package is opened, the first sensation I had was a beautiful terminal, although in the BLACK color you cannot appreciate the beautiful shades produced by Apple. But as soon as I picked up the phone to start its configuration, I realized that, even without a protective case, the DIMENSIONS were at the limit of comfortable one-handed use, both for size but also for WEIGHT, with the risk that, having the glass back, could get out of hand.And I can guarantee that these feelings can only be properly understood by using the telephone and not by trying it a few moments in a store. But even in this, many may get used to it; after all the needs and feelings of everyone are different. The thicker and BOMBATI FRAMES significantly increase the width of the phone and having in any case a glazed back if we still want a better GRIP, a better outlet for everyday use, we will have to add a HOUSING. At this point I tried to buy two cases of different thicknesses, one of which is SLIM, but not extra slim, because if a phone like this gets out of hand and the case is not sufficiently protective, the glasses make a bad end. About the WEIGHT, about twenty grams more than the X, with the addition of a lightweight case, we arrive safely at 219 grams and if in the flying use we might not realize that much, if we want to manage the terminal with one hand, then maybe supporting it with the little finger from below, or we have a long phone call I can guarantee that the 219 GRAMS added to the WIDTH of the phone begin to be heard. In all this, the HANDLING OF USE loses a lot towards the iPhone X. Someone may object that it is enough not to add a case and the phone is lighter, of course, but at the risk of destroying a terminal that is not exactly cheap if unfortunately there gets out of hand.For a judgment on the CAMERA, I state that I am passionate about photography, but normally I use my Nikon reflexes and change the lenses as needed. Overall, the cameras, both front and rear, are excellent lenses, as much as less during the day or at dusk and I noticed a greater BRIGHTNESS and better DETAIL than the iPhone X, especially in conditions where the light is poorer. All thanks to the new HDR SMART which combined with the new processor guarantees good clicks. But if you go to zoom the sharpness could drop since there is not a 2X optical zoom as on the iPhone X. But what did not convince me on the rear camera are all the reflexes, of which most annoying and not eliminable, which you have if photos are taken in the presence of ARTIFICIAL LIGHT; not only powerful lamps or lamps, but also small LED lights. Some annoying LENS FLARES that in some cases cannot be avoided even by moving of position and that leave clearly visible on the image of the reflected bright points. I honestly don't know if it's the copy I received or if it's the XR standard. So better iPhone X or iPhone XR? The correct answer could be iPhone XS, but the cost rises a lot. Having tried both the X and XR models, personally, evaluating the pros and cons of both terminals, at the moment I would still vote for the iPhone X. But if you have no problem managing a properly NOT small end, undoubtedly the iPhone XR is a balanced phone with good overall performance; if then there was a revision of the downward prices, even better. As for delivery, even in this circumstance it was as always fast and punctual on Amazon's part, thanks to the Prime service. I hope this review will be of help in choice for other interested people.
4263	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	daniele	5	Perfect phone ...	2018-11-23	it	What to say is a top-of-the-range iphone ... super fast .. huge screen but usable ... and fantastic lcd .. crazy battery I can stress the battery stretching it on and watching video .... from morning to night and I can go to sleep that I still have 45% of battery .... the phone and fast faceID super fast even in the dark ...
4264	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Utente Mario	5	Really a nice phone	2018-12-15	it	I purchased this phone during the black friday taking advantage of the discount that Amazon had applied. I waited almost a month before writing the review to test it completely and I must say that I am now fully satisfied with the purchase. My biggest doubt was about the price because I always wondered if it was worth paying so much for a cell phone. To date I must say that it is a product that has fully met my expectations. I know that one of the problems with Apple phones is the battery life and I chose this model because reading around is the model with the greatest autonomy of all iPhones and even in this respect I am fully satisfied in fact a single charge lasted me for Three days. At the moment I am fully satisfied with the product. On the seller nothing to say because it was Amazon directly as on the shipment which was very fast, arrived after just over 24 hours from the time of purchase is in perfect condition. Recommended
4265	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Antonio	5	Great device	2018-12-02	it	I state that I switched from an iPhone 8 to this wonderful iPhone Xr. The impact phone looks much bigger, but you get used to it ... FaceID is really amazing, never had recognition problems. For the rest there is nothing to say ... All performing as it should be! Indeed, the camera is a beast! Amazon shipping to the top.
4266	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Alias	3	We are not Face ID	2019-01-10	it	Too big for my taste but above all for my hand ... the weight is felt and in the pocket it looks like a tile ... Face ID very uncomfortable in many cases, it is not a worthy substitute for Touch ID ... the lack of the 3D Touch for those like me who are used to using it you feel more than anything else to move the cursor in the text ... otherwise nothing to say, exceptional battery, camera ditto screen like the previous models since it always mounts an lcd , audio (for a phone) phenomenal but I gladly go back to my iPhone 7 which in some respects is far better
4267	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Fredy	5	Great	2019-01-09	it	Hi, I wanted to wait a while before doing a review. Original product, arrived sealed. Date of purchase 15 Nov 2018, reception 9 Jan 2019. iPhone XR for now goes great, I do not have many pretensions of a phone because I use it for work, mail, doc etc etc ... gico nothing, ingenbanti apps nothing. I changed my old iPhone 6 16gb only because the memory was insufficente, I now have this 128gb that I hope will go on for another 4 years the average I change phones.
4268	iPhone XR	128GB	Yellow	Cliente Amazon	4	Great phone	2019-02-17	it	Taken because it is the most "economical" among the iphone. The phone comes in the original packaging still with intact protective film. As for the most discussed features of this phone: - the camera is very good, despite the lack of the second one we find in the other latest models (which in my opinion is more aesthetic than functional), it never gave me any problems.- the 3D In my opinion, touch is not lacking in touch, but I have to admit that coming from Android was not an element that hindered me from buying right from the start (instead, just prolonging the pressure) .- the screen, if they hadn't told me which is different from the others, I would never have noticed the difference. It's very good and to notice the difference you have to put the xr next to an x ​​/ xs and look at them well. Besides the battery (the element that I most feared, since the iphone's are famous for the battery that is too easily discharged) is actually the best , as declared by the apple itself, never mounted on the iphone, really good.
4269	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Igor	5	honest price	2018-12-07	it	the prices I have to say fluctuated a lot, but if they follow a little and you are careful you can pay (sold and sent by Amazon) on 130 euros less than the apple price; considering the reliability of the Amazon warranty I would say it's a good price. The colors at those prices I found only black and white. On the device there is little to say and on the internet you find hundreds of reviews
4270	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Raffaele	5	Great iPhone	2018-12-03	it	It is not the first iPhone I use and I can say that this Xr is really well done. Really brilliant screen and the battery is its strong point. There are many detailed reviews online and I can only say that this is the iPhone to buy this year. Purchased during Black Friday at a great price directly from Amazon!
4271	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Lorenzo	4	It's Apple (for better or for worse)	2019-01-16	it	It is Apple and this should already say everything: both in terms of quality (top quality construction, excellent software optimization, powerful hardware and price range, top camera) and defects (very thin packaging) for the price range, at least a fast charger should be expected, inability to expand the internal storage memory, excessive "" closure "" of the software). The iPhone XR, in particular, benefits from the same hardware as its bigger brothers (Xs and Xs Max): this translates into an incredible speed, attested by an antutu score "" off the chart "" (354395 points). However, being an economic model (so to speak ....), it also has fewer features regarding the display (which is not OLED and is not even full HD, if I'm not mistaken), and to the rear camera (which is single , even if of excellent quality). The display is still the best ips that can be found on the market and the dimensions are generous (6.1 inches), making the games and multimedia content very enjoyable. There is an excellent wireless recharge, where the absence of the audio jack for headphones. Concluding: the full 4 stars deserves them all. If you have the apple ecosystem (mac, ipad or both), it could be a good compromise in terms of price (always remembering that it is Apple). Also recommended if you want at all costs the latest Apple cry in terms of hardware and if you like the colors offered. If you simply look for a top of the range, however, suffers from the competition of excellent Android devices more competitive in price, as well, even at Apple, last year's "old" iphone X, which, in the face of a less powerful (but still very valid) chipset, offers the OLED display and the dual rear camera.
4272	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Luisa M	1	Iphone XR black spot on the display	2019-05-15	it	I write this review to show the photos of the display of my Iphone XR just arrived, box closed, all new with film and everything, as soon as I opened I tried to turn on the phone and nothing, I thought it was flat the battery, but it wasn't like that, I made a forced start in CFU mode and after a few minutes you are logged in (which I didn't like) I started to notice this black spot on the lower right, but I thought it was something of the settings, I configured everything and this spot always visible , I searched the forums and saw that it's a flaw. I'm sorry because I'll have to stay without a cell phone another week :(
4273	iPhone XR	64GB	Yellow	bandirali cristina	5	The best	2019-03-18	it	After analyzing many reviews and comparisons between his older brothers, I decided to buy 64GB iPhone XR, and I can confirm reviews of this product. This iPhone is the best of this year in terms of price quality. While not having the OLED fool the resolution is good and the colors are as well. The range of colors offered by Apple are very beautiful, I chose the yellow, and after two months I can say that it has not yet tired me. Not having the OLED screen allows the battery to last longer, in fact with a bland use you can get to a day and a half. Instead with an intended use you can easily arrive at the end of the day. The camera is quite good, the portrait mode is the same as that of the iPhone x despite having an extra camera. In conclusion I can only recommend it.
4274	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Marino	5	Does not disappoint	2019-01-25	it	Package arrived after one working day with raw materials. It comes well wrapped with the usual Apple box supplied with iPhone, charger + USB cable and headphones with lightning input. After a couple of days of use I can say that: - The face ID is precise and fast, much better than to the fingerprint reader.- The battery takes us safely in the evening after a busy day.- The camera is competitive and quality even if it's single.- I was a little skeptical on the screen, having previously had a super AMOLED come back on a LCD was not a tragedy, the color difference is noticeable at the beginning but all in all it is an excellent panel that did not disappoint me. - The dimensions are perfect, having medium sized hands, I can perfectly use it with one hand. (it's a little smaller than an 8 Plus)
4275	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Cliente Amazon	5	Great device at the right price	2019-02-11	it	SHIPPING: Nothing to say to Amazon, excellent as always. Ordered on Wednesday morning on Thursday at 9:00 am he was already at home, half shipping Nexive.PRODUCT: I state that I have always been an iPhone owner from 4 onwards, in December I get the mad desire to try android and buy a OnePlus 6T (great device, nothing to say but unfortunately for people like me who are used to IOS it was difficult to stay with android so I made the phone and purchased this XR). Beyond the fact that the price is high / low and all the various speeches, it's a great device for everyday use of a simple ordinary person, then it's up to everyone to decide how much and how to spend their money. The phone in its form (maybe a little grandino) is a beautiful and functional device. Great photos (even if it has a camera in less than XS it makes beautiful photos unless you have to take part in a photo contest, but I don't believe otherwise you would buy a nice reflex). Lack of 3D touch (you don't even miss it a lot because 50% you've never used it in its potential capabilities or even don't know what it is for). Great stereo sound, very smooth video, perfect touch. Display is not an AMOLED like XS but it is absolutely a nice LCD display there are those who have compared it to the iPhone 4 but they have no idea what they say, bright colors and it adapts to all the needs of visibility (night / sun / etc) if you want an AMOLED then you pay 1300 euros instead of 899 something even if it will have to change otherwise they were the same device, but as said for the camera unless you have to do who knows which projects is great. Normal speed also because it is the same XS processor. But note very very important that I had not seen yet on any iphone boys is the BATTERY, excellent durability for daily use, arriving in the evening with almost 30/35% charge. Having said that, on the web there are miles of reviews, but for what a normal person should do in the daily use the super tip !!! I repeat unless you have to make plans for NASA or photo projects the phone is a great device and in my opinion even at the right price. In the end you save almost 300/400 euros on the iphone xs / xs max and you have in your hands the same identical processor and a better battery.
4276	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	cristiana	5	Good purchase!	2019-03-09	it	It is the first time in my life that I purchase an Apple product: as an operating system it is rather intuitive, less inquisitive than Android. Specifically, iPhone XR has a screen that is congenial to me, very good audio, excellent connection speed. Remarkable support Apple in case of doubts or problems .. maybe he found it a bit 'uncomfortable to keep with one hand, but it is a price that I pay more than willingly for a screen like that. Amazon always very reliable: product arrived on schedule without any hitch!
4277	iPhone XR	64GB	White	stefano	5	The xr phones to be discovered	2019-01-13	it	I liked the speed of delivery (after two days had already arrived) the phone meets my expectations.
4278	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Luigi B.	5	It's an iphone ...	2019-01-04	it	After several reflections I chose XR because for me if you want to stay in Apple I consider it the best choice, with the benefit of hindsight I would have taken Rosso or Giallo (live they are spectacular) the white I chose for a greater resale
4279	iPhone XR	64GB	White	FC	4	Best price quality iPhone 2019	2019-03-17	it	Probably the best price quality iPhone. I don't go into too much detail because I took it as a gift since in general I find any Apple product "too expensive" compared to an Android smartphone of the same or higher quality. IOS is undoubtedly more suitable for those who want "" less thoughts "" in the daily use of the telephone.
4280	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	LO	5	Great!!!	2019-01-24	it	The battery is the best iPhone I've tried so far. Personally, I'm not particularly stressed because I'm not a fan of videos and social media (with the exception of whatsapp, which I use assiduously every day), but I can still confirm that, even listening to music and working with emails and documents, the battery lasts beyond the day! For the rest, what to say .... is an iPhone !! Not very comfortable due to the size to which you get used rather quickly and which in any case also allow me to use it as a book reader. I would buy it back at 100%, although I am aware that the price is above the average of a good product of other brands .Last engraved on the shipment: product arrived in advance of 2 working days with respect to the initially estimated delivery date.
4281	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Donato t.	1	Disappointment, defective product	2019-06-07	it	Product arrived Thursday 6 June. Just turned on, after 1 second it turns off and it doesn't turn on anymore, through assistance service first Amazon and then Apple I bring the phone in assistance, it results defective. Activation date of the phone is January 13 instead of June 6, I lost two days almost to figure out how to solve the problem, shipping was fast but unfortunately the KO phone. I needed the phone with some urgency, I was screwed. If the ignition problem had not happened to me and I would have used the phone regularly I would not have known about the date of its "first ignition", I would have lost 6 months of warranty on the mobile as well as I would not even have been able to do the application. The helpful and kind Amazon assistants. Now I made the return. Absolute disappointment and loss of time.
4282	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Vanessa	5	Super purchase!	2019-05-08	it	The product arrived within the timeframe set by the seller, is presented in a well-packed package and is exactly as described. Excellent value for money. Super product recommended for those who love Apple products. As far as I'm concerned, having switched from an iPhone 6s to an XR, I admit that the size of this smartphone is disarming! Like all things ... it's a matter of habit. Basically it is equal to a "" plus ". I also add that the quality of the photos is crazy! Costicchia is true, but Apple never disappoints.
4283	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Lorenzo	5	Amazon very serious seller	2019-04-09	it	Perfect phone, guaranteed assistance throughout Europe always at the high standards of efficiency and quality of Amazon (I was in Germany at the time of need). Telephone with European codes (verified), no rip-offs and no imports from other markets. Super price, 128GB phone paid 800 instead of 950 just a month after the release.
4284	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Massimiliano Ritarossi	5	Great Product	2019-05-22	it	Coming from a 6s I can only say that this is enormously ahead. Excellent battery life and very clean and linear design. Perhaps a little excessive weight. I am very satisfied overall. purchased the evening after 22:00 and arrived before 12:00 the next day. Great price (even if after a few days it has dropped by a further 20 euros). Highly recommended.
4285	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Massimo F. - Roma	5	Beautiful and impossible	2019-02-08	it	Absolutely beautiful and easy to use, it finds its strength in the Face ID. The huge screen makes my previous mini-iPad practically useless. The extra long battery life and wireless charging are other pleasant surprises. In contrast, the width of the screen, the size of the battery and the large front and rear windows make it bulky, heavy, slippery and fragile. The list price certainly does not help its popularity: there are many competing products similar to a third. The quality of iOS and Apple services are not discussed: it was enough to place the old phone alongside the new and 10 minute clock to make the new phone fully operational and fully configured like the previous one. Only thanks to Amazon, and its network of valid affiliate sellers, I managed to get an excellent size of 128 GB, new with Italy warranty, discounted by 20%. Too bad the delivery wasn't very fast.
4286	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Elisa	5	Iphone XR	2019-02-18	it	Purchased as a replacement for the 16gb iPhone 6, which no longer had any storage space. Ordered on the afternoon of Friday 15, arrived in not even 24 hours. Amazon's shipping is as usual unexceptionable. Arrived in an anonymous box, inside it I found the original apple box with all the components: various chargers, earphones and booklets. At the moment the phone looks like a great device, I expect it to last at least as long as the predecessor
4287	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	Marco	5	Really great	2019-06-04	it	I have been using the phone for more than a week now, no problems have yet been revealed, photo and video quality really good. I switched to this XR (blue 64Gb model) from a medium / high end Samsung, but only after a week I would never go back. The price is very expensive compared to other non-Apple devices with similar features, but as always the Apple brand is always a guarantee. I recommend it for those who want a beautiful, high-end, aesthetically pleasing phone.
4288	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	I.	5	The best quality-price	2019-05-31	it	I bought my iPhone XR in blue, simply spectacular, excellent quality photos and the zoom camera for portraits (external camera) works really well even using only the software. A phone that despite having differences with respect to x you notice little and nothing. At first it will be a bit difficult to leave 3D Touch but it will get used to it after a while. Great article
4289	iPhone XR	64GB	White	oscar Di Napoli	5	Great product ... Too bad for the battery!	2019-05-26	it	iPhone has always been a quality product, and this XR has nothing to envy to iPhone XS, of course, it has something less, but it is the right phone for those who want all the Apple quality at the right price that does not rise above € 1000 . TECHNICAL FEATURES An Apple A12 bionic processor, which gives it the same potential as the XS series, performs well during daily use, never noticed any type of slowdown. end of the day with a measly 15% supports wireless charging. The largest LCD screen of the XS series and slightly smaller than the XS Max, is something in between, the resolution is obviously lower. Camera with a 12 mpx lens very good to take pictures but sins on the night side, nothing to say for the portrait photos, it must detect a face, if it detects it then it makes a nice photo. Very good audio but also no audio jack hereFace ID very convenient and slightly faster than the predecessor hours iPhone XIn general this is a very valid product and is recommended for those who want to enter the Apple world. Let's say for the starters.
4290	iPhone XR	256GB	White	Piccolabeky	5	iPhone	2019-03-05	it	Very beautifull! The day arrived. It is my first iPhone and I must say that I will never go back to expensive Android !! iPhone is another story. I took this but if you also take 8 it's a smartphone bomb and the price starts to be better already! Price quality of this model? There are no words on quality, but the price is too high !!
4291	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Cliente Amazon	5	I recommend it to everybody	2018-11-30	it	One of the best orders I've ever made: the product arrived earlier than expected and the price is cheap!
4292	iPhone XR	128GB	Blue	John Paul H. Avila	5	If it is apple, quality guaranteed	2019-05-13	it	the best of both worlds in terms of memory capacity and camera clarity. great sound too
4293	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Andrea Demarini	5	Fantastic	2019-06-05	it	Great terminal. The resolution, much criticized, is absolutely not a weak point but in my opinion a strong point. In a display of this size, high resolutions are only advertising, this instead allows a lower consumption and an even longer battery life. Great display, fantastic sound. Monstrous battery!
4294	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Giulia	5	Apple is always a guarantee!	2019-05-01	it	Apple does not deny, this is also a great device and that thanks to the perfect integration between the various apps allows you to take full advantage of all the potential of this iPhone. In the previous 7 years I always had iPhone (5 and 6s) and after the sudden "death" of the last I wanted to give Android a chance by buying Huawei p20 pro: 500 € absolutely thrown away. With iPhone you go on the safe side and you are never wrong!
4295	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	RugCo	4	Good product except for the FaceID	2019-02-13	it	The characteristics of the product do not require evaluations being a hyper-known device and covered by any type of review; on a personal note, however, I find the Face ID absolutely inconvenient .. by its nature it does not allow you to unlock the phone unless you hold the device in your hand while watching the screen, it works badly in the dark and in any case is not foolproof even in normal lighting conditions. The Touch ID was definitely more practical, I hope they find a way to reinstate it.
4296	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Cliente Amazon	5	Excellent: very fast, good battery, great ergonomics, good camera, large display, dual SIM	2019-01-25	it	I have tried so many Apple and Android phones and the XR I find it great: very fast, the battery lasts more than a day even with intensive use, sometimes up to two days. For the rest what to say, the usual ergonomics of the iPhone, unattainable by all the tried Android and the excellent ergonomics and intuitiveness of Apple and iOS. Also interesting is the possibility of having 2 SIMs, even if one of the 2 is virtual and currently in Italy is hardly exploitable. The only real flaw is the impossibility of expanding the memory. It would be preferable to have a real file system that gives the possibility to organize documents and files in folders. Too bad for the lack of optical zoom and that the display, although excellent, does not reach the quality of other OLEDs even in much cheaper phones. The price is a bit high but the quality is paid and the durability is superior to many other models.
4297	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	luca	5	Iphone xr black	2019-01-31	it	Fast seller, I paid and the next day sent me the product that arrived with 2 days in advance. Recommended, keep it up As for the phone, there is nothing to say; amazing. The transition from the iPhone 6 to the XR is huge. Beautiful aesthetically, fast and the biggest screen is of an incredible comfort. Recommended product.
4298	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Pippo nanni	5	Perfect delivery	2019-03-14	it	Technically advanced battery much better comfortable to use even with one hand
4299	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	CP	5	A good choice	2019-03-23	it	I am satisfied with the choice of this iPhone. More economical than XS. The purchase on Amazon allowed me a saving of almost € 50 compared to the Apple Store. It was delivered in one day and obviously in accordance with the order
4300	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Mauro G.	5	Great smartphone	2019-02-04	it	Needless to review, they talked about it far and wide! Great phone, a bit heavy, if we want to find a flaw (208 grams). Compared to the XS it loses a rear camera, 1 Gb of RAM and has an LCD screen, which in return is 6.5 "against 6.1" of the XS (Oled).
4301	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Ely87	5	iPhone	2019-01-23	it	Amazon guarantee the best ever, delivered the day after the order, perfectly packed. NEW. I go from a Samsung s8 to this iPhone and I feel really good, great phone. Battery life depends on the use you make, for example I have to charge it every night!
4302	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Raffaele	5	Excellent in every aspect	2019-02-03	it	I gave this iPhone XR for Christmas and the lucky recipient uses it with great satisfaction. The phone is very fast, the screen is bigger than an X or XS and even if it's not OLED, the image quality is excellent. Battery life is phenomenal. I advise
4303	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Vittorio	3	overweight	2019-02-03	it	The weight of the new iphone xr is excessive, used to 7, this looks like a brick.
4304	iPhone XR	64GB	White	willy	5	Great purchase from a fast seller!	2019-01-28	it	It's perfect, the battery has an excellent durability, it's almost as big as a plus, the only small flaw I've read have found other people too, it's that it can't connect with the headphones I use for sports.
4305	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Nico1960	5	A good gift	2019-01-13	it	What can I say, I am very satisfied, delivered ahead of the scheduled date. I saved money compared to other sellers, original product and not with brand telephone operator.

4408	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	AleM	4	The most sensible to buy	2018-11-23	it	Product that allows you to have almost the same characteristics as the older brothers while saving several hundred euros. The waivers are there but they are not serious, but there are even two advantages: the battery is the one that lasts the most and the screen is halfway between 10 S small and 10 S big, an interesting balance.
4409	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Nicola83	5	Fast and beautiful	2018-12-12	it	Excellent smartphone, as always Apple does not deny and manages to create a device of excellent materials and smooth and fast operation, excellent screen even if not OLED as the brothers XS and XS max and really high performance camera.! Bello also the fact of being able to choose more colors. The price is always very high and in any case more affordable than the other new Apple models
4410	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	KenShiro💪	1	For me it's NO!	2019-04-01	it	The strengths for this smartphone are certainly the battery life, camera and processor. For the rest .. it is disappointing .. Very excessive weight, notch and frame from ugly back .. Not to mention the price ... really exaggerated! For up to the Chinese brands always used to copy the iPhone have found alternative solutions decidedly more suited to the current needs ...
4411	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Ale Chops	5	XR 64GB Red	2019-04-16	it	after the bad end of my iPhone 6S, I needed to buy a new iPhone (always true to the apple!). I was strongly undecided between XR and XS but then I thought that the difference of € 250 was not justified and so here I am with the XR in my hands. capacity, color and size are subjective so I will not dwell on these issues. AESTHETICS: then it is not at the level of XS for example, indeed I find that some colors make it look like a toy but once put the cover goes all in second flat. BATTERY is infinite, never happened to me that I could not download a phone even though I wanted to. mainly use whatsapp Facebook and instagram, I call and take pictures, nothing else. and although I live with the phone in hand, the battery takes an eternity to discharge, never seen anything like that.FOTOCAMERAwow, really a very good level compared to my old model (but it is also obvious), above all I was surprised by the photos made in the dark, they are very bright and come well! in general I find it is an "inexpensive" model that is worth much more than the top range of other brands! I only noticed 2 flaws, but we are serious ?! how should i put the phone on the surfaces? finding a cover that corrects this defect is not quite as simple as it sounds. there is no headphone jack: again, but are we serious ?! I don't think it's nice to push buyers to buy the adapter or the airpods (given the inexpensive cost of the phone)
4412	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Stefano&Francesca	5	Better XR than X, but watch out if you have small hands	2019-04-06	it	The biggest differences between XR and X are the size (larger XR of the X) and the camera (better than the X). I never tried the X camera but the XR one is excellent and not I would like better, while I find the screen bigger an important advantage! As a woman or for those with small hands, the XR is a bit bulky, a little awkward to handle. For example, you can't use it by holding it with one hand. Durable battery, beyond the 2mmars, using it enough. Despite the bulk I would buy it again!
4413	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	Alberto	5	Great!!!	2019-02-08	it	Great phone !!! I have always had android ... I decided to move to the Apple world and for now after 2 months of use, even if they are not many .. I can not complain at all! And the famous immediacy of use of Apple smartphon is real !!
4414	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Cliente Amazon	5	Quality	2019-03-24	it	Coming from the year of Android I can say that there is no comparison pee regarding the operating system .. Ios is a marvel, the camera is of excellent quality even if it is simpler, the battery with normal use guarantees two days, the face is not misses a beat .. I was surprised by this smartphone I would buy it again
4415	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Riccardo Zulian	5	Usually iPhone	2019-01-21	it	I do not have a review with verified purchase because I took it directly to the Apple store. The usual iPhone is perfect in both the hardware and software parts. It is the right compromise to stay at home without spending too much.
4416	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	Davide	5	PERFECT seller and product	2019-01-10	it	The package arrived before the scheduled date from Amazon, inside the receipt, the perfect package in everything and for everything packed in a more than safe way! Fantastic phone, similar battery for now has no flaws.
4417	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Milena Salvemini	3	Excellent battery life, good screen resolution	2019-05-20	it	Excellent screen resolution, battery life up to 5 hours intense, the camera could be improved in some places, but by now I bought it for 2 months and I must say that I can't make it any less. Excellent product I recommend it
4418	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Lorenzo	5	I Phone XR 128 giga bianco	2019-06-20	it	Everything perfect, another € 170 discount on the list price with Italian warranty. Ordered at 10pm and delivered home the day after at 2pm ... what about Amazon the TOP
4419	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Gessica Castellani	5	Superb	2019-05-09	it	The phone arrived intact in time, super protected by films, as if it had been purchased from the store .... for now I find it magnificent .... we'll see how it behaves later.
4420	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Vincenzo Vitale	5	Very fast	2018-12-01	it	Very useful phone, very fast. Only that the delivery arrived after 2 weeks but I am satisfied

4422	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Tommaso	5	Great	2019-06-22	it	Come on, there are only a few characters left and then I can finally say that IPhone XR was a great buy
4423	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Angelo	5	The question: better X or XR? The answer: better XR than XS Max!	2018-11-26	it	After trying the whole iPhone series I arrived at XR attracted, I don't deny it from XS Max (but unusable due to size) and in love with the 8 plus (the perfect smartphone to date) it was too much the attraction to explore XR: it will be the colors ... but the same colors reminded me of that iPhone C which was objectively a low end of the iPhone and a phone abortion that didn't deserve the bitten apple printed above. Well, XR has absolutely nothing to do with 8 plus, even with iPhone C, indeed ... just taken in hand gives the feeling of a small ingot built with skill and design but that transmits sensations of solidity in a Factor form that no iPhone had ever given: the perfect size! It is held with one hand, yes it manages perfectly and has a very wide view perfect for multimedia use. Stratospheric audio as only iPhone knows how to give. Materials and construction that really convey a Premium feeling. With XR you find the substance but also the beauty, the colors of art! What a masterpiece this XR boy is, finally on Amazon at an honest price you are faced with 10 reasons to buy XR and preferable to the whole iPhone range (X, XS and XS Max included!) : 1) fantastic display: brightness that absolutely does not regret an Oled, rather ... in the light of the sun every time you thank him for having it!) 2) solidity in pure state in perfect dimensions (with the X version and I watched the videos I thought "" this display is really small "" 3) art: beautiful colors, I chose black, a classic but also an ingot of black gold! Pure perfection, the edges are not noticed and give a feeling of absolute beauty.4) autonomy: here there is no comparison with any iPhone in history: 8 hours of active screen which is more than a day of intense use5) reception: with XR I have almost full signal in areas where with X or 8 plus I had problems mainly in the cellar where I usually have no signal with this XR I have 2 notches, honestly I do not know why but I think it is a set of factors (antennas, processor, materials) 6) face unlock: the future, recognizes the face in every light condition even in the dark ... every time you have to download an app, open a protected app ... face unlock makes the difference, in fractions of seconds it's everything ready without having to make any clicks! 7) A12 Bonic 7 nanometer processor = low consumption and stratospheric speed8) XS / XS Max camera but with a single lens that is not only well protected thanks to the "XR" design but it is also beautiful! Yeah ... you don't have that classic traffic light that now all Chinese phones have copied! 9) Absence of traffic lights and originality, if you have XR YOU SEE! Don't confuse it with 100 other models produced by the whole world with a traffic light camera. If you want to be noticed it is XR that identifies the bitten apple of Cupertino! 10) Last reason: with XR you get the best iPhone model and you get 400-500 with which you can buy your wonderful Apple Watch 4! 'true iPhone is XR! If I have been useful just a click! :) All good to all and good iPhone XR! ———- November 29: Apple informs us that iPhone XR is the best-selling iPhone ever!
4424	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Danilo mariani	3	it costs too much for what it's worth	2019-01-17	it	if it had been for me I would never have bought it. average product sold at a top price, the magic of apple marketing € 900 with the 1a charger !!! ridiculous battery, ips only screen with too much frame, too protruding chamber that with the original cover is leveled, pity that then it becomes a brick
4425	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Davide	5	Perfect phone, new still packed!	2018-11-26	it	New product still packed, exactly like the one sold in the apple store! If you know how to seize the moment, you can pay it considerably less than at the Apple store (got 128gb for € 799 instead of € 949).
4426	iPhone XR	64GB	White	PEPPE BIT	5	what to say: ALWAYS APPLE ALL LIFE	2019-02-24	it	Maybe because I have been buying APPLE for 18 years, it will be that I loved STEVE JOBS since it only sold products that nobody bought, but this XR was a surprise. . he had asked me why all the classmates had that brand that made FICO. Then, every night, he always asked me for my APPLE 8 PLUS and left the new one on the LUNCH table. AT THE END he asked me to change it with the XR. LESS EVIL THAT WAS AMAZON PRIME !! SAID DONE: returned the product and purchased the XR. Revolutionary product compared to my 8, total screen, brightness and colors unattainable for my DEVICE. It reads everything like a KINDLE for clarity of characters and contours of letters and images. Different gestures in the access phase to the screens but, as always with APPLE, immediate and intuitive. MACHINE photos at the level of my 8 even if in my humble opinion still my terminal if the PLAY with the XR in terms of depth of field and brightness of the lens. The last advantage of the XR is that it is very long but narrower than my 8. So WE READ GOOD chat and FB and ONLINE NEWSPAPERS without having to keep scrolling down the page given the screen size in length. BUY NOW WITHOUT DOUBT
4427	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Luigi 94	5	The iPhone to buy at the moment	2019-01-05	it	After hearing many conflicting reviews on this smartphone I decided to buy it and test it with my hands. Design: ok, the edges more marked than the more expensive xs and xs Max are seen and in some ways may seem ugly but believe me that if do not compare them within a day you will get used to it and you will fully enjoy the nice and elegant design of this phone. Display: perhaps the most criticized and in my opinion unfairly. Then the 326 may seem few but they are not. The display is well defined, ok, there are more defined ones, I myself come from a note 9 which has a display with over 500 ppi and if compared, you can see the difference but in everyday use you don't absolutely notice. The thing I appreciated is the quality of the panel from all other points of view. It is the best LCD display on a smartphone. Blacks are not absolute as an oled but they are very close, almost perfect viewing angles and the most amazing thing is the balance of colors that are very faithful to reality. A fundamental aspect for those like me who work with photography. Battery: exceptional. The iPhone with the longest life ever produced by Apple. You arrive at the end of the day using stress with plenty of 25/30% Camera: it is the most advanced camera on iPhone at the moment, along with the xs. Beautiful photos, sharp and the smart hdr is a bomb. I personally don't regret the second room I also had on the iPhone 7plus. All the features of the most expensive iPhones remain except for some portrait modes and of course the 2x zoom. The front camera instead is exactly the same as xs.That is to say, the most balanced iPhone ever. It is not cheap but it is a phone that dismantles all efforts by competitors to focus on technical specifications. You don't need a 4K display, you don't need 2.3 or 4 cameras. iPhone XR focuses on the user experience and I must say that it succeeds in full.
4428	iPhone XR	64GB	Coral	Chiara G.	5	A truly "Great" XR!	2019-02-01	it	I purchased this iPhone XR to replace my still working 6S, after almost four years of honored career. What convinced me apart from Apple that it is already a guarantee? The color I fell in love with at first sight, the performance and last and not least, the price of Amazon, without a doubt the most convenient on the market!
4429	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Karhu	5	iPhone XR 64 White	2018-12-21	it	What to say! The much mistreated iPhone XR goes to thunder! Lightning fast, never a lag, never an uncertainty! Very pleasant to use, and a practically infinite battery! I have heard criticism for the "cornices" (they are there but they are not so invasive), for the screen (it will not be Oled, but it is an excellent display perfectly calibrated) etc etc. It is a very reliable terminal, pleasant to use, without frills, but still swanky in colors! Dxomark has elected it the best single room telephone! In short, highly recommended to those who want an Apple terminal, with large battery, without unnecessary and expensive frills! The only flaw? The price: too high! Let's say a € 100 too much!
4430	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Marco J Bernardi	5	iPhone XR, great price and nice device	2018-12-22	it	Great price for a device that has just arrived on the market. Apple is always the best choice in terms of quality and ease of use. While not having the retina screen like its big brother, the difference is not noticed very much during a standard use. Excellent purchase
4431	iPhone XR	256GB	White	gianpiero	5	Big screen, super performance, top battery	2019-07-03	it	I liked the price. SENSATIONAL AMAZON. Bought during a trade war between mediaworld and Amazon. Storage 256gb at 802 euros. Great price quality. I had a lot of iPhones but I have to say that it has everything I need: big screen, great camera (Halide app tip for blurred effects even on objects and animals), fast with the A12 Bionic chip, battery that arrives quietly at the end day. I come from an iPhone 6s and the transition was super positive.
4432	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	giangibeng	5	Iphone XR Blu	2019-01-11	it	In the end I too, like many others, opted to purchase this model at the expense of others (X, XS and XS Max) and I must say that I am very happy ... (I didn't try them though!). The lack of 3D Touch in favor of Haptic is not so fundamental. It is very beautiful aesthetically, the battery lasts a lot (2 days) and the advantage of the Apple Software for app functionality and reliability is unquestionable compared to Android, even if before I owned an excellent Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact! The delivery was a little slow (for the Christmas holidays) not due to the excellent seller. The phone is perfect but does not come from Italy and the slightly lower price is justified here.
4433	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Simone Borsotti	5	iPhone xr	2019-07-01	it	What to say is an iPhone, a product of excellent quality and for better or for worse whoever takes it knows what to expect. The delivery was more than fast, amazon was surpassed one month in advance on the scheduled date and thanks to a super offer the price was almost unparalleled! Great
4434	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Orpheus	4	Apple iPhone XR	2018-12-11	it	Smartphones built and assembled with care, give it a product that is qualitatively superior to the average. I do not consider the value for money to be comparable because the latter is high; The advice to those who for reasons of their own want to stay in the Apple ecosystem. Delivery took place in the established times.
4435	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Cliente Amazon	5	iPhone XR 128 GB	2018-12-26	it	Arrived as if it were a raw shipment, perfect packaging, undamaged phone with its original box. Open and turned on without any problem, the description of the seller is excellent. Recommended
4436	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Francesco	5	Everything perfect except the price	2019-06-01	it	I bought this beautiful smartphone, everything perfect. Excellent shipping as usual. The price: good only that the day after Amazon decides to lower it by 60 € and I believe that it is not correct and for this I give only one star.

4454	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Mario V.	5	iPhone of all respect	2018-11-26	it	Purchased at a lower price than the price list. Sold and shipped by Amazon. The phone is definitely a good product. The LCD screen that everyone really despises is really great. Certainly making a comparison with X or XS would not make sense, we are talking about two different panels. And of course it costs less than the latter. The photocomera does its job well thanks to the software optimizations. Faster than the X model. Incredible battery life compared to the old models. Surely the edges are thicker but I must say that after a while this thing is no longer noticed because they are very homogeneous. I recommend buying it if you find it at a lower price than the list price.

I just want to highlight what struck me about this iPhone: - the quality of the new generation LCD screen, the Liquid Retina - the exceptional autonomy battery, the most "long" ever for an iPhone (even on the screen) - and the camera is not bad either ... it has only one lens but it's bigger ... sure iPhone XS Max and some Latest generation Android do better, but it is well defended ... and all in all this FaceID does not go wrong ... honestly I thought worse ...

4462	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	fabio	4	Nothing to say, it's apple!	2019-07-07	it	Nothing to say about quality, it's an iPhone! The battery problem remains one of the weak points of Apple, but with iPhone XR we have taken a huge step forward. As size, it remains a bit big and you can't reach it with just one hand on the other side of the screen, but this we already know from the moment of purchase.
4463	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Marco	3	Great, too bad for the microphone	2019-07-12	it	Great phone for functionality and performance, unfortunately the one received by Warehouse as a new one actually had a defect on the main microphone that forced us to return it. Ol defect seems quite common when speaking around and on the web, so I suggest to do tests comparing tone, clarity and tone of voice when using the upper microphone (speakerphone) and the lower one (standard mode). Our sample made communication difficult to understand if not using the speakerphone. For the rest, perfect, fluid and comfortable

4470	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Massimo e Katia	5	Iphone X or Iphone Xr, which one to choose?	2018-12-16	it	With the release of the new Iphone and above all of the Xr, Apple has removed from the list the X, not so much because it is obsolete, but precisely to avoid that the two smartphones could overlap in the choice of the users and not to see the sales of the new born diminished from its predecessor. So it is more than legitimate to ask oneself which one should buy, let's see if I can remove some doubts about it. Let's start with the differences. Indeed no. I want to immediately take my mind off. "The notch". The hateful black cleat is, unfortunately, I say, present on both. Come on, now all the menate on sensors pass, projected dots, face recognition, which incidentally work wonderfully, but band is always in the middle of the boxes! Do you want to check the battery percentage, or if Bluetooth is on, or the name of the operator, etc.? You have to constantly pull down the drop-down menu. Let me understand, processors that not even NASA to speed up the use of a few tenths of a second and then I have to do up and down like with a shutter even to see how much charge I have left? Not to mention the wonderful effect it makes on videos, photos and games. Do you want to put the effect of a nice holiday movie with a black strip? But like we did without it, I wonder. I can understand the technical needs, but in everyday use it is disgusting. Well ... now that I stalked the notch and took off a weight, we really move on to the differences between the two terminals in question.-The size and quality of the screen. X has a 5.8 oled that supports the hdr and the Xr a 6.1 lcd. The X wins for quality. Higher contrast and higher pixel density, not that the "liquid Retina lcd" of the Xr is ugly, on the contrary, it is more than good for most of us, it is clear and looks good in any light condition. It's just that oled does all this a little better. The Xr wins on dimensions. Those who like the large display should have no doubts. -The 3D Touch. There is on the X but not on the Xr. I will not throw a hackle at the use of this feature, I can only say that you live well without it. However, this is enough to win the X. - Use with one hand and portability. What I tell you to do ... however the Xr is a good compromise and not too uncomfortable. -Battery. Here the Xr wins hands down. You want to have dimensions, you want the LCD to take less, the fact is that you arrive at the end of the day quietly. A nice plus for many. Wireless charging for both, although I find it inconvenient as it does not make the smartphone usable except for contortion and more wear on the battery compared to the cable in the long run. It can be useful in overseas travel where this standard is widespread in many places, from the airports to Starbucks. Cost. With the exit from the list and various offers the prices are the same. Goalless draw. However expensive, the melina is paid ...- Processor. The prize goes to the Xr. It's slightly faster, around 15%. Will we notice it in everyday life? Hardly. The X is always very fluid and responds well in all situations.-Weight. Twenty grams less for the X, I know, it's just funny to say. You need to have butter instead of your arm to make it a discriminating factor. Even if you wanted to get it over your head, you wouldn't notice it. -Materials. This too is pretty funny. However those of the X are more "noble", steel against aluminum. As if we didn't put them in improbable cases or passed them all day to touch them. However the "naked" one is more resistant to scratches. Everything here. - Software updates. For personal data the Xr is in advantage, if it is your intention to keep it for a long time it is a variable to consider, being born a year later it should have on the card even a year more updates. Colors. Black and white for X, black, white, blue, yellow, coral and red for the Xr. If you have to match it with the color of the upholstery, the latter wins. Face Id. Fast and impeccable on both. On the Xr it has improved in speed and precision. But it works regardless. Well, water resistance. IP67 certified, so they are resistant to 1 meter dives up to 30 minutes. Draw.-Quick top-up. Another draw with cable and power supply sold separately. -Rams. Three gigabytes for both. And you live peacefully. - Camera. A single camera for iPhone XR, two cameras including a zoom for iPhone X. iPhone XR relies on software and image processor to do some of the things that iPhone X does with optics, this last solution is normally preferred. They both have a 12 MP sensor, optical video image stabilization, both record 4K video up to 60 fps, and both allow slow motion up to 240 fps. The front camera is identical between the two terminals, although on XR it can record 1080p video at 60 fps. To the advantage of the iPhone XR, in addition to the depth control, the presence of Smart HDR, which uses different technologies to give photos more points of light and detailed shadow areas. In a nutshell, however, in the "normal shot" or in the wild selfie, we won't notice any particular differences and both solutions don't disappoint. I speak as a basic user, certainly not as a professional photographer, just specify. In the photograph each of the two has strengths and weaknesses that are balanced with respect to the competitor. For me also in this field it is a draw. But we come, you will finally say, to the conclusions. If you want a screen with greater diagonal and battery life, go to the new born from Apple, if screen quality and portability are important to you, the tenth anniversary iPhone still has a lot to say. Yeah ... because despite the Divine Comedy that I presented to you, the differences are not many, as I said before, the Apple foxes would not have removed the X from the price list otherwise ... Choose according to your needs and why not , especially based on the offers you find in the various stores. I hope I have been helpful, I remain at your disposal for any other questions.
4471	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	🇮🇹 Schälflj 🇮🇹	4	iPhone X or iPhone XR? The sensations of use after the first month, but for me it is still iPhone X	2019-01-21	it	As owners of the dated, although still valid iPhone 6s, in the family we decided to update ourselves and taking advantage of the fact that finally Amazon sells iPhone directly, we purchased an iPhone X and also an XR (see my other review) now often aligned on the sale price under 800 euros (December 2018). By bypassing the technical features that are now easily found on the net, I dwell on the sensations of use after about a month. The iPhone X arrives in its classic original Apple packaging, with the inside HEADPHONE with ligthning connector, the ADAPTER for non-ligthning headphones (that is an accessory that is commercially worth 10 euros but unfortunately does not provide in the XR Apple) and the usual charger; if we want a fast charger or we have it already or we have to buy it. If we already have an iPhone the CONFIGURATION of the new device will be fast and in few minutes we will have our iPhone X operating. Compared to previous generations but also compared to XR, my feeling is that the iPhone X aesthetically has something more, at least in the materials used and in some finishes, obviously if we cover it with a non-transparent cover, the design will camouflage it. As for DIMENSIONS, those of the IPhone X I find them the most correct and balanced; slightly larger than the 6s / 7/8 but with a screen much wider than 5.8 "", but without reaching the 6.1 "" of the XR that, due to the greater width and thickness of the frames is at the limits of the comfort of use with a hand, what is allowed with this iPhone X instead. The OLED SCREEN of the X is still today a great display superior to that of the XR, although comparing it sometimes with the LCD in certain circumstances I almost appreciated that of the model "" economic "" 2018, at least in the shades of white. The Apple technicians in this have done a great job for the 2018 models. The WEIGHT of the iPhone X is still contained and even if we add a cover, we will always remain about twenty grams less than the XR; it may seem little, but if we add the smallest weight to the smaller X dimensions, I find ASSAI more comfortable to call and use the iPhone X with respect to the XR with one hand every day. Regarding the FLUIDITY OF USE, despite the iPhone X processor is one year older and slightly less powerful than the XR one, I can guarantee that the two phones play almost equally. The AUDIO of X (but also of XR) in phone call and also for movies it is more than good, as is the 4G telephone signal and also the WiFi signal.With no particular problems, the fast transition from WiFi to 4G, at least under the Vodafone network. The FACE ID does not miss a beat, in any light condition, even low and almost in any situation. I didn't notice any particular differences with iPhone XR. It is enough to register your face twice as the phone asks for in the initial configuration phase and we will forget the physical button in the past. As for the CAMERA, I state that I am a photography enthusiast and prefer to shoot with my Reflexes. Nikon on which I can change lens as needed, but the camera on the iPhone X still performs well; although in this on the XR despite having a unique camera, they succeeded thanks also to the new HDR SMART and the updated processor, to gain more details and brightness, especially in poor light conditions. On the iPhone X I have not detected the same unpleasant defects as LENS FLARE, or annoying reflections in the presence of artificial lights; I have not really understood if it is a defect of the XR that I received, or is the standard of the model 2018 camera, with the iPhone X BATTERY, if we don't stress the phone too much we should arrive late at night without too much trouble; in this case the XR manages to guarantee a little more autonomy of perhaps a couple of hours, but I think because it simply has the largest battery and an LCD screen that asks for less energy. Therefore evaluating the various pros and cons, at the moment it does not I can promote IPHONE X as a device that I personally find even MORE BALANCED and more COMFORTABLE and MANAGEABLE, especially at the same price with the most recent XR. Perhaps because the XR despite being improved as a processor and camera, for everyday use I still find it too big and heavy and also because comparing them in real time I didn't find all these differences such as to favor the iPhone XR. Another question would be if we chose the iPhone XS, but in this case the costs would rise more than appreciably. These are obviously only my considerations and other people could find in the XR that plus to appreciate it and promote it more than the X. 'iPhone X, also in this circumstance was punctual thanks to the Prime service of Amazon. I hope that this review of mine can be of help to other people interested in the purchase choice.
4472	iPhone X	256GB	Gray	Redecent	5	Perfect	2018-05-07	it	There is not much to review. As a loyal customer of the Apple world for over 16 years, who is familiar with original packaging and accessories, I can only confirm that I could have made a great deal, buying an absolutely virgin product, with undamaged packaging and with particular original wrappers as it was purchased at any Apple Store, saving at the same time a good deal of euros. In relation to the expense, I did not make any problems in choosing, during the order, the Express shipment. The product arrived in about 18 hours from shipment. Sure I will buy again from this seller as soon as the next top range iPhone by will be available in the catalog.
4473	iPhone X	256GB	Gray	Massimo	5	EXCELLENT PURCHASE	2018-05-14	it	Initially I was a bit hesitant, but I trusted the reviews and I proceeded with the purchase, all perfect and with a considerable saving compared to the Apple list. The phone arrived sealed in its original packaging, nothing to complain.
4474	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Giova500	4	The big deception of the 5.8 "" display of the iPhone X	2018-11-28	it	It's amazing how beautiful all iPhones have always been, but I come from an iPhone 7 and honestly I don't see any difference because they are almost the same size. In short, in my case I should have opted for iPhone XS Max or an 8 plus. That's why I consider the size of the 5.8 "" display of the iPhone X a great deception.
4475	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Ciro	5	Highly recommended.	2018-12-05	it	Paid 770, a smartphone that currently has nothing or almost to envy to rivals or older brothers. I will not dwell too much because reviews around there are plenty of them, I will limit myself to stressing that it is worth pointing out even though I have a year behind me. This or xr? Personally this, a much higher display and comparable performance if you don't focus on the benchmark numbers.
4476	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	RecensItaly	3	Expensive. Value for money questionable	2018-12-30	it	Starting from the assumption that I bought it myself but the real user is another person: with € 777 (Amazon offer) you can really buy a lot more things and maybe more useful and fun. The phone from his is perhaps the best iPhone ever made, more than xr and XS in my opinion at every juncture, but then again, with all this money you can buy us more useful things: a great washing machine, two thirty-inch TVs, a PC medium-high end, a dishwasher, a refrigerator with ice machine, a good-sized three-seater sofa, a used Young panda. In short, by buying this product you take a great phone (at least for reputation) but with a very high and unbalanced value for money due to the brand it carries. Recommended for those who love fashions, want to take off a whim, have a lot of money and want to impress his girlfriend by buying it. Not recommended for those who are inattentive or clumsy (it is all screen is easy to break).
4477	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Sergio	5	iPhone X welcome Apple's confirmation	2018-08-19	it	He has gone from an old 4S to the iPhone X. For me a welcome confirmation on Apple products which I also own Tablet and Computer. The newly purchased smartphone is very nice especially in the display of excellent resolution. Excellent also the camera and the many features that only iPhone offers, in short, a unique product of its kind. The service provided by the Digitech P seller was also excellent. In addition to delivering the product to me earlier than expected, it was always very helpful, kind and prompt to my every request.
4478	iPhone X	256GB	Gray	Filippo Azzarri	5	Perfect	2018-07-31	it	Impeccable seller, trouble-free product, purchased and received in the stated times. I had all the apple models so I know the product very well, unbeatable for me. All perfect. I recommend this seller. Top
4479	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	1	iPhone x	2018-12-29	it	I come from iPhone 8 Plus. Audio sometimes crackles, some lag still exists. FACE ID comfortable but not 100% accurate. The only good thing is the smartphone size despite being a 5.8 inch. / 18I don't know if it is a bug ios but audio in capsule is not heard but only in hands-free mode (rarely happens), after turning it off everything returns to normal. Other times you go to open the call and you can't do it because it seems blocked, after pressing the volume key it accepts the call. I'm trying to solve with apple assistance but if they don't solve I will have to make a return (very disappointed by this phone) Update 05/06/19 Although I updated and formatted the phone as advised by Apple today all the problems found in several blocks have returned. Combio phone and operating system
4480	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	stefano	5	iPhone x	2018-09-21	it	Excellent phone, iPhone X offers excellent performance, both for the convenience and for the speed of the system, fast shipping and well looked after in the package!
4481	iPhone X	256GB	Gray	Juan	3	It works well but with many MAs	2018-12-24	it	After two years with Windows Phone 950 XL I returned to IPhone. A huge leap, or perhaps seemingly enormous, compared to the iPhone 4S that I used for 4 years but there are quite a few but. The planned obsolescence is one of these aspects together with the really too high price for a device that should cost the half. And it is not justifiable the so high surcharge based on the internal memory at a time when the price of ssd and microsd has fallen by 50%. In addition to hardware features present for years in other smartphones that Apple presents as innovative and unique when you decide to implement them in your device. In any case I am reborn, the software side really works superbly in addition to all the available apps that work very well and there are every relevant aspect of daily life (bank, mail, e-commerce, mail, browsing, messaging, social media, etc.). The rest are all superfetations that any Android smartphone has but here they work much better in every respect. The only comparable Android device is certainly OnePlus 6T, for which I was undecided and where we find all those software and app optimization features at an unbeatable price and consistent with the object that today can be defined as smartphone. Buy an iPhone and desire it in an obsessive and spasmodic way this year then to say the following year that it doesn't work, that has problems, which is bad for the sole purpose of buying the next model, which will follow the same destiny makes us think.
4482	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Rachele	5	great	2019-03-17	it	I waited a while before reviewing. I hesitantly bought a cell phone online. Arrived early, super wrapped and packed to get through the trip. The product arrived intact. It works and there have never been any problems. I wrote to the seller for the invoice to take advantage of the guarantee and there were absolutely no problems. The phone is beautiful. Of course the price could be lower, but being an apple, there is nothing to say.
4483	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Federico Molinari	5	A more than recommended purchase	2019-01-14	it	Bought on offer to take the place of the now ancient iPhone 6. What to say? The battery lasts almost a full day, the Face ID works great and is of incredible comfort. Excellent photographic compartment, excellent quality screen, processor and RAM give an excellent speed of use. The only flaw is the considerable weight, but for value for money is a purchase that is difficult to regret.
4484	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Federica	5	Perfect!	2018-11-27	it	Complete package of all components and with intact packaging. Telephone completely intact and working. As indicated by the Prime option, delivery in lightning time, the same day of the black friday after only 18 hours from the order.

4487	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	celeste	3	is it new or reconditioned?	2019-01-27	it	I bought this iPhone for 799 euros, so good as long as I notice the audio crackling a lot in some videos or songs, starting the front video camera the audio it records is low and muffled. I asked for a replacement and the customer support was very friendly. we hope the other has no problem.
4488	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Paolo Vincenzi	5	Beautiful object	2019-05-19	it	Great phone, both in style and invoice.

4561	iPhone X	256GB	Gray	Sandro	5	Problem with product code.	2018-07-06	it	Two purchases for the same product fast shipping, well tracked, product ok, product code as described in the Italian version. The second: everything ok as the first for shipping and product, but non-Italian code (Danish or Swedish). Too bad, even if the version is not influential on the functionality of the product, I purchased here because the product code was well specified in the listing. I repeat, sin, I would have definitely bought again, but here we think that people buy then without checking if the product is as stated. Thanks anyway.

Delivery was estimated after 10/12 working days but after 2/3 days it arrived and everything with free shipping. Very satisfied. Convenient price.
4564	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Francesco	5	Very beautifull	2018-11-28	it	I state that I did a madness, that it was a dream for me to get my hands on such a beautiful product. I always had 200-300 euro phones but having seen the offer on the black friday I could not resist and I decided to take it ... I come from a samsung s6 which obviously did its years and the battery left me halfway day .... I think this product needs no introduction, those found on the net ... I can only tell you that as a passionate user I find myself very well, all fluid, never a block, beautiful photos and fantastic design .. arrived in one day with amazon prime .. everything perfect !!
4565	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Francesca	5	Great smartphone	2018-12-28	it	Excellent smartphone, fast and elegant design. Expensive, like all iPhones.
4566	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Stefano	5	Fantastic	2018-03-07	it	I'm not a phone fanatic and I'm not always there ready to change model every year, but for simple personal tastes I always choose Apple when I have to do it. where we started this new model is a beautiful achievement. I've been using it for a week so I still have to find out completely about the features, but right now I can say that the choice of removing the home button is absolutely winning, the face ID is fantastic and the new HDR screen makes its figure. With the changes we have to take a little hand at the beginning! Serious and reliable seller, everything arrived in perfect condition.
4567	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Nicola83	4	Great product ... but is it worth it?	2019-02-12	it	A very valid iPhone for all its features, excellent color display with excellent camera and excellent hardware, fast and reliable ... improved battery! Now the price has dropped considerably given the release of the iPhone XS, XSmax and XR .. but what is worth buying.! Given that they are all excellent phones and do not disappoint, to save a little you could opt for the Purchase of the iPhone X but without underestimating the possible purchase of a new iPhone XR that comes at a similar price but with features in some respects improved some of these are the hardware and the battery.!
4568	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Luca G	5	Seeing is believing	2019-02-26	it	The purchase did not happen on Amazon but reviewing this article, for me as a fan of the Apple brand, is a pleasure. I don't want to make comparisons with other models of the most recent house that I consider different for some details but not better characteristically, and certainly you can't compare it to its predecessors since, the X, is much more evolved. I will concentrate on this model trying to simplify the incredible innovations without falling asleep to read its WIDE manual. Material: steel and then scratch-resistant with ultra-resistant glass screen.Home: without key but with scrolling from bottom to top, the first in Apple's historyThe control center with curtains from top to bottom starting from the right. These allow faster access with minimal movement. The screen has an impeccable image resolution and the dual camera is the best ever installed from the house with new features such as portrait, Live Photo etc ... true depth camera for facial recognition too unique and perfect in operation. Apple starts this new generation of iPhone by installing awesome and very useful apps like: home kit and health envied and a little copied. I've heard about battery problems that download too quickly: 1 charging with cable from the possibility of recharging 50% of the battery in the first half hour. 2 we can always use it with energy saving mode.3 but whoever we want to make fun of, is so surprising that we use it continuously; check "usage time" if you haven't done it yet. It is true that the screen uses a lot of battery but it is also true that this is the right compromise for a high quality vision. I would like to tell you about all those possible features and compatible Apple accessories that are used to make the most of all those apps but for this there will be another time or you can directly ask me questions since I read that ample operating manual I read and reread and I know for sure that I could go on and on in describing it. This is just the brand reviewer with a smattering of what to me is a 5-star article that I recommend to evaluate. I am still available ... bye
4569	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Manuel	5	state social	2018-04-16	it	I state that it is the first Apple device I buy, having always used Android phones. At the first power up I had some problems with the configuration as I had a sim cut off, which the phone didn't recognize. After buying a new sim, it was a pleasant discovery every day. The transition to iOS was simpler than expected and was much more intuitive than believed. As for the smartphone it is perfect. It does not have any type of problem at the level of processor or RAM, so no lag and immediate opening of the app. Never crashes. The reception of the operator network is perhaps smaller than the other top of the range, but always present. Also the Wi-Fi navigation is excellent with the signal that is immediately acquired and maintained. The Hardware component is definitely the highlight of the product. The front and rear glass gives elegance and a good grip. Superb play of light from black to silver that is created on the back with light. Front and rear camera from the top of the range, perfect for daily use. Effective instant identification in recognition and release even in conditions of total darkness with only light of the smartphone to illuminate us. The screen is wonderful for the eyes and the glass is fairly oleophobic. The frames are made of stainless steel to give greater resistance to impact. However the borderless design causes the risk that falling on the edge will cause the liquid crystal of the screen to break. Paid on amazon 969 euros. Surely the price is out of the market and excessive. At much lower prices there are equally competitive phones (to stay on identical iPhone 8 specifications). However, holding this device is unlike any other. Definitely to be purchased only for status.
4570	iPhone X	256GB	Gray	Luca C.	5	iPhone X	2018-02-23	it	Perfect iPhone, fast delivery and secure package closed for good. The phone had its original seal. I admit I had some doubts before buying and I hope this helps others since there were no reviews here. Reliable seller at 100% and available

4572	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	5	WONDERFUL	2018-02-02	it	It is equal to the various comments heard and seen on various press organs and on iPhone Italia. It is a product with excellent simplifications and a very rapid exercise. Everything becomes much easier and faster. There are new commands (swic) instead of the home button that you absolutely don't regret once you are familiar with them. It has an extraordinary OLED screen that transmits images with extremely real colors .. Everything is at hand. As read, it is a question of opening a window on the future of telephony.

4587	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Amazon Customer	5	Apple iPhone X Review	2018-03-25	it	Usual packaging, usually content. Slow charger (takes about 3 hours to charge), wired headphones (with adapter for standard 3.5), pin, stickers, data cable. Beautiful touch and feel of steel. Better than aluminum. Smoother, more polished. But the other side of the coin is the weight. At first glance it seems heavier than its 174 grams. It is at the limits of one-handed usability but is not particularly slippery. Personally I find it very beautiful. Front. Behind the camera a lot of jars, especially in white color. There is no notification led. And unfortunately, despite the oled, there isn't even a portion of the screen that is always active with notifications. In the "" horns "" (as I love to call them) there would have been great. Powerful stereo speaker! One below and the other in the capsule. But what surprised me is the faceID. Precise, punctual, extremely reliable. In any situation of use. I dare say more comfortable than touchID. And Apple confirms itself as the queen of optimization. Unblocking with the face is not new, but it has never worked so well on any other terminal I tried. Night, day, sun, lamps, darkness. Always works. And if left on a desk it works with a good angle of face positioning with respect to the perpendicular, let's say a good 20th. Beautiful, very beautiful display. And the brightest measured so far. Over 1000 lux horizontally, peak 1300. True tone that I like, makes the colors warmer and contextualized and colors very faithful. Ok, white turns slightly to blue compared to perpendicular but nothing to do with the Pixel 2 XL. The brightness sensor is also excellent. Processor and memory. The A11 bionic is very powerful. The ram on iOs counts less than Android and here we have 3gb. 64 or 256 the two available memory cuts. Photos and videos. Essentially similar to iPhone 8 plus. Although similar to the downside. He suffers a little more in low light. But, thanks to the depth sensor, he succeeds in the portrait and AR effects even with the anterior chamber. The videos are at the top as usual. And for stabilization, and for quality and resolution. Very full stereo sound even with integrated speakers. Sounds great even with headphones .... but need the adapter.
4588	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	1	Very bad purchase	2018-04-15	it	I state that my review is based on the product and not on the seller. I bought this new iPhone, because I wanted something more, something new and different ... instead I found myself holding an iphone 7 plus, a little smaller ... with a camera that was the same but positioned differently and a horrible cleat (notch) in front of the display that basically turns everything you watch on the screen ugly. Non-expandable memory, no fast recharging and even IP68 certification to withstand water and dust, not to mention the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to transfer photos and other media to the PC, everything is slow and cumbersome and iTunes is really a slow and heavy program. Practically an old iPhone for a big change, which has only the price of change, twice the price of a normal iPhone, an absurd price and totally unjustified for what this phone really offers! Equal in all respects to the old models. To say that I am disappointed is an understatement ... I do not recommend the purchase, if you are looking for the wow effect, move on to the competition, which here is only the salty price.
4589	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Gino Pilon	2	Iphone x	2018-02-16	it	Ios won't let you do almost anything. He decides for you but this was already known. Poor reception, excellent battery and face id. In conclusion good phone if it cost about € 600.00
4590	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	giuliapizzo	5	What I expected, everything perfect	2018-04-16	it	I was a bit skeptical about buying an object of so much value via amazon, but I changed my mind, everything went very well with timely delivery as expected. On the phone what to say, is what I expected, I have always used apple passing from the various iphone, of course coming from an iphone 6 the difference is noticeable and as above all in the battery life
4591	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Rayjuve11	5	iPhone X	2019-01-25	it	iPhone X, very fast phone, very efficient, battery that lasts so much respect you have previous iPhone. Very elegant, beautiful and very vivid screen colors, the right size screen, what about and in my opinion the best iPhone on the market.
4592	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Vincenzi Luciana	1	Software ok but wobbly glass ... not closed well. returned	2019-02-25	it	Arrived very quickly. Purchased and placed directly in custody bought together more tempered glass. It works perfectly. A few days later I remove it from my case to look at it a little bit and I notice that the glass is wobbling. I go to an Apple Store to show it and they offer me free glass replacement. I do not agree to have spent so much on a cell phone already to be repaired. I return it with great disappointment. I was unlucky
4593	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Spenko	5	Exalted	2019-05-15	it	There is little to really say, there are reviews made very well so I won't dwell too much. Until now I have been owner of Android phones, but I decided to switch to iOS for practical reasons and also to change a little air. The phone is made with extremely good materials and the Silver color gives much elegance and refinement compared to the black, definitely more sporty. With the guarantee of Amazon then it is another story, even better to buy it in an Apple Store. Top!
4594	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Nicola Bordiga	4	Great iPhone, the impeccable material that distinguishes Apple!	2019-02-25	it	Start one with a brief aesthetic description of this iPhone as it is the one that struck me the most. Aesthetically it is very nice to see, solid and with really good material. From a certain impression of something compact and it is a pleasure to hold it without a cover, but the robustness is probably only appearance because for some devices protection is essential. The back I find fantastic, many do not like the dual camera (12MP + 12 MP) to "protruding" "traffic light but I liked it and from my point of view it is also very practical with the original cover as it goes to fit perfectly without forming a gap between the cover and the camera. On the side there is obviously the volume + and - key, the switch to switch from ringtone to silent and on the opposite side there is also the power button. There is no home button and unfortunately there is still the huge notch (the black bar at the top of the screen). The audio instead is stereo fortunately and is very good, but as you know Apple no longer produces iPhone with earphone jack. With a 5.8 "" (2436 x 1125) Super Retina OLED screen and a weight of 178g I give him a good 9 out of 10 for the design. Now I'll illustrate the internal hardware features that didn't impress me much, in fact I was expecting a lot more from a smartphone with such a high value. Start from the processor, which is perhaps the best part as from 2017, Apple has mounted an A11 Bionic CPU about 25% faster than the A10 Fusion predecessor which allows it to perform a much faster and smoother Face ID analysis. said before it is double from 12MP each structured to traffic light and despite being so modest, it can easily perform video in 4k at 30 and 60fps, while the frontal one from just 7MP can easily record at 1080p and has the famous ability to exploit Animoji (transform the face in an emoji as you often see on social networks) .iPhone X can use a wireless charging system due to its rear composition. The battery is around 2716 mAh and for those who believe it is a low capacity it is wrong, as Apple is famous above all for giving life to products that do not generate high consumption and hold more charge than many competitors with maybe 3500mAh. The duration of a charge hovers between an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 plus but you can rest assured that you will reach it at the end of the day. I have almost reached the end of this hardware macro-sector and the RAM that good or bad interests everyone has not brought satisfaction, in fact mounts just 3GB against the 8GB of One plus 6 which costs about half. iPhone x is for sale in 64GB and 128GB version and if I had to rate the components as a whole I would opt for a 6.5 out of 10. Software for the system initially operating iPhone x was released with iOS 11 with numerous gestures to fill the lack of the home button and has already updated to iOS 12 where it was found a greater fluidity. I am not a lover of the Apple but I was pleasantly surprised by this freshness in an instrument which, although not the best in the technical data sheet, is still the most reliable and the safest compared to the competitors. Software reviews 10 out of 10 I probably already said everything about this iPhone, but if not, I invite you to get information on YouTube through various video reviews on many reliable channels. The overall rating is 8 out of 10 and obviously this is my personal opinion. It will be up to you to judge according to your needs. It's a great phone but I suggest you think about it before purchasing as it's not the cheapest and an iPhone is not suitable for everyone :)
4595	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Massimo	5	Great product, as always	2018-12-03	it	"Excellent value for money" cannot be said ... the price of the iphone is objectively very high, however their products are unique so there is no way to compare them. They cost little to do. Battery in line with expectations, at the end of the day it needs to be recharged to face the following day in safety. Waterproofness ... I don't know, I don't want to try: I export perfectly from iCloud, faceId very beautiful and innovative , working even in the absence of light.
4596	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	giuseppe	4	Iphone x, great phone, nothing to complain, only arrived with two days delay	2019-01-12	it	The phone arrived two days late, for this I put 4 stars, then x the rest is great like all the iphone, this particularly being an iphone x. Beautiful screen, even the size. Very fast and nice. The lower part of the screen that reaches the lower edge is beautiful ... the upper notch is nice but they could do a little smaller ... anyway I recommend it ... a little gem ... certainly the prices a little high .. .
4597	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	pumillina	5	A little gem!	2019-05-26	it	I went from an iPhone 6S to an iPhone X. There isn't much of a difference: the display is a little bigger but you don't notice much. Unfortunately, the notch is really horrendous, well, so to speak. The photos, however, are much better, much more defined. Even in facetime or similar calls, greater clarity is noted. After all, I took it to take good pictures (I have a travel blog) and so I'm satisfied! PS Even the battery seems to me to be harder.
4598	iPhone X	256GB	Gray	Renato Amato	5	Excellent purchase	2019-06-05	it	I was a bit skeptical at first, fearing there was some hidden problem. Instead everything was perfect. I got an iPhone x 256Gb, arrived a few days ago. Original packaging, intact, perfect. Phone and new accessories in perfect condition. Exactly identical to the Apple Store purchase. The phone works perfectly. Recommended.

4609	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Amazon77 love	5	the king of smartphones !!!	2018-02-14	it	bought after selling mine you do to say iphone 7 plus, this iphone X is really beautiful, powerful, beautiful aesthetics, infinite battery life coming from a 7 plus .. who finds defects in this product has no reason to do so !! ! the top !!!!!

4612	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	Helarf Macavilca	5	The top of the tops	2018-02-28	it	Guys, this is the first time I have dared to buy an Apple product and I must say that I am more than satisfied, I have always had Nokia even when it became Microsoft but I must say that they cannot be compared at all, the iPhone is of a another level of technology, so, without stretching too far, believe me when I tell you that it was absolutely worth making such a sacrifice, especially this X in my opinion is simply the best. It is already a month that I have it and it works wonderfully, no defects for my tastes and my needs, if you have the chance take it immediately!
4613	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	5	iPhone x	2019-07-14	it	Arrived on time perfect iPhone

4615	iPhone X	256GB	Gray	Gianluca	5	Excellent operating system, perhaps exaggerated cost	2019-07-13	it	Cost in my opinion really too high. IOS is another thing, higher level than a lot
4616	iPhone X	256GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	5	Great product	2019-07-04	it	Very satisfied with the purchase ... my iPhone X was delivered to me the next day ... unopened package ... Apple is a guarantee
4617	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Garu	5	You don't need many comments	2019-02-08	it	The product now knows, at the purchase price below € 800 I consider it a good purchase, nothing to complain as always about Apple products
4618	iPhone X	64GB	Gray	siervolino	5	All right	2018-12-27	it	On the phone of course nothing to say. I know or have used rivers of bits and pixels for reviews from people far more titled than me. Amazon a certainty, arrived after two days in a perfect way.
4619	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	ROBERTA C.	5	Iphone X	2019-02-22	it	Repurchased for the second time. Excellent quality / price ratio. Sold and sent by Amazon for just under 800 euros. The product is new, without brand with 24 months warranty.
4620	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	ANDREA CAPIZZI	5	overall judgment	2019-07-03	it	really a great retailer. I will certainly make other purchases. very available
4621	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	Fabrizio	5	Perfect	2018-02-16	it	Sold and sent by Amazon, a guarantee not to be underestimated! The only flaw is the fact that on the invoice there is NO reference to the serial number of the phone that comes. The product is however new and to be activated, so it is possible to carry out the Apple care in a second time from the dedicated Apple site
4622	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Massimo B.	5	Is there anything else to say about this smartphone?	2018-07-28	it	is the fourth iphone I buy, and I believe it won't even be the last. The transition from the 6s is felt, both in terms of speed and in quality of the shots. All purchased at a really interesting price. 5 stars deserved
4623	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Christian	1	Not covered by warranty	2019-04-21	it	The seller declares that the product is Italian I had already, as soon as I bought it, raised the problem I was told that it was absolutely for the Italian market. In reality it is not so! I will go through the legal channels
4624	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Sebastiano 94	5	Great	2018-02-10	it	Beyond the product itself (Apple is a guarantee of quality) the smartphone is original. I have been using it for 3 months and I am by god. I was a bit skeptical about switching to iphone but damn that time I didn't do it before! Also recommended as a price here on amazon.
4625	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Andrea	5	Original iPhone 8 recommended	2018-03-15	it	Original product arrived on time. Original box with original battery charger and headphones. I RECOMMEND this purchase! I found myself very well.
4626	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	4	Excellent product, original and new certificate	2018-08-18	it	Original and new product, ascertained by a code on the apple site and by explicit request to operator of the apple support. Product arrived early and, months after the purchase, I can confirm that I am fine. Congratulations to the seller for great price and service! The only flaw is lacking the documents and instructions in Italian.
4627	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Davide Caforio	5	Purchased from Amazon.	2019-04-16	it	I bought it for a gift, sold and sent by Amazon for the price of 599.99. To be as safe and quiet as possible with the guarantee. It arrived 1 day earlier than expected, packed perfectly. I have one too and I've been using it for about 5 months, and it's very comfortable. The only drawback, however, if you stress so much is the battery. For the rest super recommended. Particularly if sold and shipped by Amazon.
4628	iPhone 8	256GB	Gray	Angelo Marro	1	TRUFFATORI	2019-03-19	it	Seller ostio, does not respond satisfactorily to requests for returns, I feel really taken for a ride after I was sold an extra limited iPhone (not specified in the description) as per invoice, after 5/6 months of controversy no one can give me the right support. I spent 850 euros for a phone that is worth up to 200 euros. indecent seller, complaint already made.
4629	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Giada	5	Perfect	2018-02-25	it	Purchased by Maritel srl, perfect phone with European guarantee, the booklet is written in Croatian I think .. but ok the language is set at the first power on, works perfectly and in the package there was the invoice for the warranty 12 months Apple and subsequent 12 from the seller, what to say I am satisfied given the recent rip-off that I took on eBay ... Amazon a guarantee!
4630	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	beo182	5	All perfect	2018-08-31	it	First iPhone that I buy, I was a little afraid of buying online given the amount and fortunately I changed my mind. Delivery times respected, packaging well done and arrived in excellent condition. All original and closed. Very satisfied. It's located abroad but I expected it after reading the other reviews, but it doesn't create any kind of problem.
4631	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Alessio	5	RECOMMENDED	2018-07-11	it	Great product we are talking about an iPhone on the other hand and it corresponds perfectly to that described ... the package arrived in perfect condition ... the delivery was scheduled from 5 to 9 July while already the afternoon of 4 July had been delivered .. .else also the seller in the reply of the email to my invoice request ...
4632	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	checkout	2	Too bad for the earphones with lightning connector and consequent lack of mini jack audio output	2019-03-06	it	Given that I am very satisfied with the purchase, I rate the article with only two stars due to the unfortunate choice of Apple to exclude the audio output with mini jack and to allow the use of the earphones only with a Lightning connector (the same as you use to recharge your mobile phone). With these earphones you can no longer easily switch from the iPhone to your computer (which uses mini jack outputs), you will no longer be able to connect to the traditional audio output of seats on trains and airplanes, or even on the ergometer monitor of your gym. You won't even be able to use your favorite headphones to listen to your music because they won't enter the lightning output. There is yet another adapter that will drag all the drawbacks of the case: you lose it, you forget it, when you need it you don't find it, and I read reviews of some models that do not allow listening to phone calls but only music ... so you are more confident if you buy the original Apple adapter, as always, very expensive. Really an unpleasant choice from Apple.
4633	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	giuseppe	5	Iphone 8	2019-01-26	it	I'm really happy with the purchase. Let's start from the price that is at the time of my purchase was one of the lowest in Italy. The seller, Digitech, very serious and professional, packed the device well and provided the track number. Iphone 8 confirms the standards of the Apple brand. Currently I can't add anything else because I've been using it for a few hours. The first impression is certainly positive.
4634	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	.	5	IPHONE A CERTAINTY	2018-09-04	it	According to the iphone I buy, my first was the 6 and I must say that it is always a certainty, it always works very well, easy to use and I wouldn't go back to android even under torture!
4635	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Alex Riggio	5	An iPhone is always an iPhone	2019-03-15	it	In the meantime, I thank amazon for assisting me in dealing with a problem on the price change at the time of booking, exceptionally solved in my favor in fairly tight times. The only problem has always been the battery, which during the day forced me to recharge at least once. Problem solved finally with this model, which currently manages to hold up peacefully all day and even a little more. It is also the last one left with the 3D touch, a function that I have always found very convenient and that unfortunately in the new models will be eliminated apparently. Excellent audio, splendid camera, fast and responsive in the passage between apps also direct. For those who are comfortable with iOS it is quite advisable, but I would not make a jump from 6s to 7 except for the battery issue.
4636	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	ivan	4	iphone 8	2019-02-09	it	Excellent product with no shadow of a doubt, very fast, latest generation processor. I preferred it to the other iPhone models because of its size it fits my hand and fits comfortably in all pockets, while still maintaining a 5-inch screen that is not very small.
4637	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	Giovanni	4	Iphone 8 Europe guarantee: OK	2018-06-12	it	Fast delivery and ok product. One star less because the product had Europe warranty instead of Italy guarantee as indicated in the amazon description. Product returned.
4638	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	Jade89	4	Iphone 8	2019-03-09	it	Phone 8 silver: the product arrived in just a few days, in perfect condition, new and original. Inside the white box you will find the earphones and the charger or the key to open the sim drawer, as always, all original. Personally I consider it a great phone, and having the mac is great for synchronization. Before I had an iphone 5s for over 5 years and the difference is obviously obvious, in terms of battery (it lasts quietly 1 day and a half / 2) and speed. Council
4639	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	Maurizio	1	phone locked	2019-05-24	it	So, let's start from the fact that last week I ordered another iphone from the Amazon Warehouse and still a week after the order had to leave (with Amazone Prime). Then finally I ordered this phone that when I accessed it was stuck on an iPhone cloud ..... What to say, an experience to forget .....
4640	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Stefano	5	Best purchase on Amazon	2018-12-13	it	It has always been my best purchase on Amazon ... the phone I paid much less than I could pay at the official store.

4642	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Cliente Amazon	5	iPhone 8	2019-03-01	it	I purchased this iPhone 8, which arrived in perfect condition, to replace my iPhone 5S, whose battery had begun to experience particular charging problems after 3 years. 4 stars at battery life because this phone being new holds the charge perfectly and does not create any problems. iPhone is in my opinion the best phone, as graphics and comfort. Despite everything, I recommend it.
4643	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Mattia	5	Great	2018-05-29	it	I immediately want to clarify the fast and impeccable service of the seller, I do not add anything else since it is an iphone but it is a phone that I gave and loved, it is very fast and makes extraordinary photos. Highly recommended
4644	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Giulia	5	Satisfied, I recommend the purchase.	2018-05-23	it	Arrived perfectly, too bad it's not prime! The product arrived well packed and on schedule, on the phone there's nothing to say ... iPhone ... beautiful (all in glass and the gold version, slightly pink) ... but the phone is really nice!

The object is presented in its original box, with the characteristic Apple film, a sign that it should not be a return or a reconditioned at all.
4650	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Davide Torrielli	5	good buy	2018-09-04	it	item arrived early, in original packaging verified as original apple.operating product, all in place even if it does not differ much from 7 comes with some improvements especially in the camera part.

Even in my case the instruction booklet was not in Italian, but it does not appear to be a problem as the language can be selected when the phone is switched on.

4654	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Susanna	5	Good value for money	2019-04-08	it	There is little to say, it is an iPhone and only this is synonymous with quality. The price is very good compared to the store price, surely it is better to buy it here than in an Apple center.

I contacted the seller to get information about any guarantee in case of problems and they responded immediately. Fully satisfied

4768	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Manuciao	5	Good choice	2018-02-17	it	The item arrived two days after the purchase, therefore before the date indicated by Amazon and the seller was very helpful when I heard it by phone. The phone arrived very well packed and in the original box, intact without dents. gold color is really beautiful, it looks more like a gold rose than a classic gold that is golden, I would say that it is more prone to powder as a coloring. Very nice phone, I recommend the purchase of the iPhone 8 and also the seller who was impeccable.
4769	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Gioia.95	5	iPhone 8 Gold	2018-04-10	it	Superb !! I went from an iPhone 5 to 8 and what to say, a whole other world!

There was no invoice attached, but the purchase on Amazon is still authentic. I have been using the iPhone for a few days and so far I have not found any anomalies. Needless to say, the quality of the chosen product respects the expectations I had. 5 stars especially for the absolutely affordable price.

4779	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Michy	1	Defective Iphone ...	2018-06-06	it	I bought this iPhone in the hope of having made a great purchase, instead I immediately discovered that it wasn't the usual iPhone that gives you that Apple quality. I've always bought iPhones and it's the first time I've had to give back a piece like that. The basic problem was the battery life, it didn't last more than 4 hours. In addition to an abnormal heating of the device. Really disappointed.

4788	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Giulia N.	5	Exceptional and great savings	2018-03-29	it	I bought the phone for my partner. Initially I was a little skeptical of buying such a "" challenging "" product in this way but ..... Amazon and its partners never disappoint and I received the phone in perfect working order, with its original and sealed box and packaging. After some time the phone is perfect! Highly recommended as well as great savings!
4789	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Account temporaneo Simone	5	I can't stop using it!	2018-03-07	it	Fantastic phone, beautiful, modern ... Maybe a little inconvenient because you don't have a headphone jack and sometimes have slowdowns. Except this, it's a convenient and fast phone with a lot of autonomy (which I appreciate from a former android user) .The package has the Cyrillic writing on the back, but the phone works perfectly even with Italian operators. Also included are all the accessories and namely Earpods, lightning-jack adapter, charger and pin for sim.Insomma, recommended purchase!
4790	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Vittoria	5	Small but nice improvements	2017-12-07	it	Step up from an iPhone 6 and the changes are very few but noticeable, I do not need the change from one to the other but I recommend it to those who are in possession of older mobile phones. Excellent Amazon service
4791	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Rachid	5	iPhone 8 64 jig phone fantastic	2018-03-12	it	A very fast and fluid improved version, too bad for just two gigabytes of ram, but I recommend buying also for the price

He arrived a day earlier than the scheduled date (purchased on December 25th, delivered on the 28th). Unbeatable price, well sealed package and Italian charger. I would say that better than that I could not ask!

4794	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Filippo	5	Fully satisfied	2017-11-05	it	Arrived on time of delivery, and with relative invoice. Excellent packaging. All original. The battery charger has an Italian socket. Bought from Digital Kingdom. I recommend it, given the savings!
4795	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Frank Castles	5	Review	2017-11-23	it	What can I say, I have never made such a large purchase on amazon but I was sure because I have been buying it for a lifetime. Phone arrived a day before scheduled delivery, obviously intact and perfectly sealed inside a sturdy cardboard box. As for the phone, you will not find a price for a Iphone 8 just released. Step from a 5s and the configuration was simple and fast. Just combine the two iPhones and all the old data will be transferred to the new one (whatsap chat, all the photos, all the installed apps, wifi passwords, ringtones etc. .. EVEN THE EMOTICON YOU USE!). It does not seem to have changed the phone. In conclusion a Mr. phone as I expected, an exceptional camera that makes videos in 4k 60fps, very fast in multytasking like any iphone, exceptional colors with intelligent brightness that adjusts based on ambient lighting, amazing audio, you can even hear the bass. The design really a strong point, like every year, of Apple; curved screen on the sides, metal frame and the back is composed of a glass that is comfortable to touch and non-slip. I still recommend a cover as it is a high-end phone. The last feature I want to highlight is wireless charging; I bought a phone together with the phone to recharge the phone by simply placing the phone on it, because even Apple has decided to enter this mode. For this, I recommend buying a cover suitable for wireless charging (if interested). Summing it all up a great deal of buying for me that I don't often change phones but that when I do I choose the top. In my opinion, money well spent. Great Amazon as usual!
4796	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	BP	4	Deliveries and product	2018-12-15	it	The Iphone arrived two days later via a different shipping company than the original one (the seller told me that I had problems with the forwarding agent) The product, although coming from Eastern European countries, is new and in its original packaging intact from Apple. I had no problems with initialization and it works perfectly today. I would recommend the purchase
4797	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Lorenzo cella	4	Iphone 8 very nice but ...	2018-05-28	it	Great design for the quality of the materials and the nice feel to the touch. A11 bionic ... nice fast processor but not too lightning fast anyway great for everyday use also because it is not a "" padellone "" is quite compact and is quite compact well in hand.Touch id always comfortable in front while as for the camera it seems to me identical to 7 so it would be better to switch to an 8 plus (double cam). Overall nice apart from the cost but ..... you know Apple always raises a little the cost is enough to have a little patience.
4798	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	Cliente Amazon	4	New	2018-11-15	it	Great product, it keeps the orimesse, beautiful camera. Impeccable aesthetics. Arrived earlier than expected in unopened package
4799	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	Luca Maiorani	5	Almost perfect	2019-01-21	it	The phone is great in every detail, unfortunately the shipping was slow and that's why I didn't put 5 stars. Anyway the mobile is a fairy tale!
4800	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Maggy	3	Nothing new	2018-06-03	it	Since I had an iPhone 6 before, I didn't notice many changes and I was a little disappointed. The design is beautiful, the touch screen works well and is quite fast. Unfortunately there are no news.
4801	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	cristina	3	discreet	2018-12-01	it	I wanted gold and it came to me pink. Unsatisfactory packaging. Too early to make judgments about how it works. In the box there was not the manual, nor the pin to remove the sim .. very strange
4802	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Vito M.	5	Quality, convenience, reliability Amazon	2019-07-01	it	Original article, perfectly packaged with accessories included. Timed delivery, AMAZON Prime. Amazon guarantee, which is how much to say. It was a very welcome gift to my wife.
4803	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Alfredo	5	Sometimes you can even wait	2018-12-10	it	Arrived 3 days late but it was worth it. Original new product in sealed package. On the model nothing to say, Apple is more than a guarantee.
4804	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	marco sprocati	5	All perfect	2018-12-13	it	The seller was perfect in the delivery. The package was intact the content exactly as described. The phone works perfectly
4805	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	5	It is not the last but .......	2018-11-17	it	It's not the latest model, but the more than honest price made me decide to buy. The phone is new and works great

4810	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Ciro F	4	Ok..ma ..	2018-01-01	it	Shipping time a little long .. but true to what is indicated in the order.The passage from the iphone 5 was instantaneous and painless thanks to itunes.for the rest is the iphone of all time: quality phone (replaces my 5 that after almost 5 years is fully functional except the battery) although expensive, fast and intuitive. What I really did not like is the extreme similarity in software, with the old one .. after all these years you could do something more. Moreover the release of the iphonex has certainly risked a "cannibalization" of each other and is a fall of style for apple.
4811	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	DomenicoF	5	Great product	2018-11-16	it	Give me phone4s at 8 other ... always iPhone

4822	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	AleksejSg	3	A small upgrade compared to the iPhone 7, great smartphone but be careful!	2018-11-30	it	Of the iPhone 8 we can say that by now everyone knows everything, top of the line, fast, responsive, perfect? NO! I tell you some shortcomings that few will have the courage to tell you, 1) it's heavy TOO 2) stereo sound is anything but a big thing compared to other devices 3) the only real novelty compared to an iphone 7 is wireless charging .The battery is excellent, the screen as well, fast is fast but I guarantee you that if you have an iPhone 6s and you expect some kind of upgrade you will remain DELUXE, I can't find it among the best smartphones on the market and I make it clear that I have no preferences specific for IOS or Android, simply perfection is far away ... Aesthetics: 7/10 (I prefer the SE and many other smartphones over this) Usage and reactivity 10/10 here is perfectLightness / easy handling 6/10 heavy and slipperyQuality photo / video 9.5 / 10 nothing to complain about Quality price 6/10 (The apple did and will do better)
4823	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Cliente Amazon	2	Russian and non-Italian product	2018-02-06	it	The phone has arrived, everything is perfect, but the box and the instructions are in Russian. This makes me think that it is not the Italian version but the Russian version, while I wanted the Italian version.
4824	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Sand Creek	4	Does this make sense?	2017-10-13	it	Does this iPhone make sense at the same time as iPhone X? IPHONE IS ALWAYS IPHONE: It is true, practically on the front of the iPhone there are no differences between models 7 and 8. On the back we find however a beautiful glass panel, which with 7-layer lamination is able to take on beautiful colors and improve grip on the hand, now much better than the slippery iPhone 7. Consolidated design, well done, with no surprises, but that no longer tears the envy of friends. For those you need X! WIRELESS RECHARGE: The new glass back allows you to recharge your phone simply by placing it on a base for wireless charging. No cables! And the good news is that it won't have to be an expensive Apple charger, the phone supports the common Qi standard and you can find good ones at cheap prices. Beautiful! In this case we lose nothing compared to X. RESISTANCE TO WATER Iphone 8 adopts the IP67 standard. This means complete protection against dust and protection against temporary immersion in water (between 15 cm and 1 m of depth for a maximum of 30 minutes). But be careful: here is a catch. In fact, if on the one hand they confirm a certain resistance to liquids, Apple excludes from the warranty any damage caused by immersion in water. So: it resists water, but if you immerse it and something goes wrong apple doesn't pay a penny! THE HOME / TOUCH ID KEY: I know, it's certainly not new ... but I'm glad it stays with us for a while yet! It is so iconic, comfortable, beautiful .. The button near the thumb is simply the most natural thing to do fundamental operations like returning to the home. That's why we found ourselves so well with the iPhone so far. And it supports the very comfortable second generation Touch ID: it works well, it's fast, and allows you to unlock the phone even when we're not watching it. I'm not ready to do without it yet ... DISPLAY: No substantial difference compared to the already good Retina HD of iPhone 7 at 326 ppi. Here definitely wins the new OLED panel of iPhone X, at 458 ppi, certainly superior. The only substantial novelty is the introduction of the TrueTone on this model, that is the balancing of the colors of the screen based on the color temperature of the environment in which we find ourselves. In essence, by reading a book under an incandescent light bulb, the pages take on a yellowish color. If instead we move under a neon it will tend towards the blue.Your smartphone screen will now behave similarly. Probably you will not perceive the difference in everyday use very much, but the health of our eyes at the end of the day - especially if we use these devices a lot - will benefit. CAMERA: There is a substantial difference between 8 and 8 Plus / X here. Of course they both take excellent photographs and the sensor has been further enlarged with larger pixels that give better quality especially in low light situations. On 8 we do not have, however, zoom and wide angle nor the new possibilities of light development with study effect. Excellent front camera 7Mp. However in this field iPhone Plus and X definitely have something more. Iphone 8 also records spectacular 4K video at 60fps: definitely a higher quality than what we need for everyday life, but still not bad! Beautiful also the possibility of SlowMotion to 240 Frame, not the best among smartphones, but still good. POWER: The heart of the new iPhone 8 is the A11 Bionic processor, the last of Apple. Really powerful, 6 cores, improved GPU for graphics performance, about 25% - 30% more powerful than the previous A10 of iPhone 7. Actually, for the use of normal applications, this extra power was not needed at all. It is mainly addressed to the use of augmented reality, otherwise you will not pay any attention to it. More power in any case means more longevity for the phone, which can go on for several years without substantial problems with the new updates. Good battery life, about that of the iPhone 7. Even better, however, the declared duration for iPhone X, estimated at about 2 hours more. QUINDI, a phone that brings with it the wireless technology and the same power of the iPhone X in a design a little dated but always pleasant. I personally decided to buy it to retire my good 5S. I think this phone is a smart choice. The difference, in a nutshell, is about € 350 for the basic configurations compared to the iPhone X. The upgrade from 7 does not apply, the differences are not so tangible. This phone (it seems strange, but it is still an XD phone) represents in my opinion a good point of waiting, waiting for the new full-screen iPhones to be more beautiful and better developed. Of course, we must also consider that we take out a considerable amount for a phone that does not seem revolutionary at all .. But I still don't feel like leaving the Home button !!
4825	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Ivan Islam	1	are they fake?	2018-08-08	it	but these are original or fake because there are people who have used broken iphone.
4826	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	alessandro	2	Apple disappointment	2017-11-24	it	Buy for brand change I was really disappointed the warranty is not Italian and then it does not work very well The audio croaks and the touch is not very intuitive disappointed.
4827	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Sally	1	Money thrown away !!!!	2018-05-26	it	600 euros thrown away !!!!! The product did not satisfy me and I sent it back. The seller gave me an address but, once printed, the label was incomplete. it was therefore not possible to deliver the package which was then lost. After 2 months of complaints and discussions, I resigned myself to have lost 600 euros and I recommend it. I strongly advise that the seller is easy to anger and tried to ask me for extra money to collect the package in person.
4828	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Massimo Bocotti	5	Original Iphone 8	2019-02-25	it	IPHONE 8 original and new, still in its original packaging, conforming to the description. I arrive from the 5S model and 16GB of memory, now insufficient with continuous updates and various applications, but with this 64GB model, I solved my problems and I must say that it is also faster, not counting the resolution of the camera, and of images, satisfied with my purchase.
4829	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	NS	1	Received scratched	2019-02-19	it	I think it is unacceptable to pay a similar price and find yourself a scratched product even before using a new item. Quality control equal to zero.And the most absurd thing is that it is not the first time that strange / heavy inconveniences happen to me, unfortunately lately the quality level of the products on this e-commerce has dropped by a lot. The choice of certain couriers then it accentuates the deterioration, in fact I gave up and abandoned even my Prime subscription, in addition to buying much less since then you are necessarily obliged to return, finding yourself being called back, unjustly. I hope, for all of us, to be just randomness and not other.
4830	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Francesco Tronelli	5	Excellent purchase	2018-06-22	it	I bought two iPhone 8s within a few months, one for me and one for a family member. Always purchased by Regno Digitale. Great price, punctual delivery, new and working cell phones. Great experience.

Another nice note and not trivial, I put it in the cart and when I went to confirm it was discounted by 100 euros, since they were the last three, as soon as I bought it they were sold out!
4832	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	PaoloL.	5	Great	2018-04-25	it	Perfect timing and delivery. Regarding the product, I had the 4s and the transition to 8 is very good: similar configurations, only much faster. In conclusion, nothing to say, no problem.
4833	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Valentina G.	5	Excellent product and delivery ok	2018-06-15	it	I waited 6 months to review.

If I need phone products again in the future I think I will consider this seller. This is an iPhone 8, a well-known product, so I won't spend time talking about the phone itself.

4859	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	MONICA P.	5	Satisfactory purchase	2017-12-22	it	I bought the phone as a gift for my daughter and the product is perfect, flawless packaging. What surprised me pleasantly is the seriousness of the seller who (as I had read in other reviews) sent me the telephone I ordered 3 days in advance if I had to buy other products that are part of the 'Digital Kingdom' catalog, certainly the purchase I will do it from them ... the seriousness and the correctness today is rare and where it is there it must be rewarded
4860	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver / White	Cliente Amazon	5	Perfect phone	2019-02-17	it	Perfect in everything

4862	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Patrizio Angelo Pisano	2	Iphone? No thanks.	2018-10-09	it	After several months of use I am increasingly puzzled as to how such phones can have such a high price. Embarrassing limitations, hardware back years, bad structural quality .. There is no comparison with competitors who offer cutting-edge technologies at a much lower price. I strongly recommend the purchase of these overestimated devices with a clearly disadvantageous price / quality ratio.
4863	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Alessio	5	All perfect	2018-02-26	it	Arrived a day early .. it is the first time I make such a big expense on the internet in fact I was a bit doubtful but I changed my mind .. they are very professional they answered all my emails and there were no problems
4864	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Stefano Bassioni	5	Excellent fast and functional device	2018-01-20	it	An improved version of the iPhone 7, coming from the iPhone 6, there isn't even a very fast and fluid comparison, shame about the only two gigabytes of ram, but I recommend the purchase also for the price

4866	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Angelo Calderini	5	Perfect purchase	2018-03-26	it	Original product of Italian origin with accessories as per the Apple catalog. Fully functional, it did not detect any installation problems. Still well performing, it is a high level product suitable for a competent public that knows how to appreciate even the smallest differences. Definitely advisable.
4867	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Roberto	5	Widely satisfied	2018-01-13	it	I've only had it for a month, but I'm satisfied with this phone. I have to get used to it, coming from a completely different phone, but I like it a lot. Light, big screen, elegant, the battery lasts for 2 days with a normal use of some photos, various e-mails and messaging, use of different apps. Bluetooth does not affect battery consumption too much, like in the Windows phone I had before.
4868	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	RT	5	Not to be changed	2018-08-07	it	Higher quality product, those who switch to the Phone no longer come back for the qualities of the smartphone and for the incomparable technology.
4869	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Caska	4	All right	2017-11-06	it	The phone is original with an Italian battery charger, I think it was intended for the Eastern European market given the writing on the back of the package. In any case, fully functional and good packaging. Bought from Digital Kingdom
4870	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	1	Never received	2018-07-05	it	I purchased this iPhone on June 21st, on June 25th I point out to the seller that the shipment is stopped. I urge Nexive not to deliver the iPhone but a few days later it reports the shipment as delivered. Absolute panic forwarding complaint to Amazon. Delivery rescheduled for July 2nd ever. Item never received got refund after 7 days. Amazon has certainly repaid but it is absurd that it allows certain sellers to use its platform. Bad behavior from everyone bad experience. Maybe I was unlucky but the other reviews are all real? I strongly doubt. Amazon gets worse with the passing of months. I will always be unlucky but I buy almost nothing.
4871	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Cliente Amazon	5	never again dried plants !!!	2019-06-29	it	I purchased this garden irrigation system because having a green thumb I could not miss a product that would automatically water the plants with just a tap opening! I bought it because with a practically negligible price it really allowed me to water my whole planter ... A lot of components, great to easily create an irrigation plant for vegetable gardens and flower beds, I use it for my strawberry plants. The installation is very simple and customizable and not very intrusive, so great for those who once harvested the product must work the land for another different sowing, in 5 minutes remove everything and in 10 repaint with another setting. It can be installed in two ways to have the possibility to irrigate several vessels in separate ducts, saving time for watering. The kit arrives complete as per insertion and c in very short time. really a great buy.
4872	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	5	Apple iPhone 8	2017-11-12	it	What about ... It's an iPhone. Very smooth, very fast, very good color reception has been improved, an exceptional camera. The only flaw in my opinion compared to its size is a bit heavy compared to other smartphones. I had doubts about the life of the battery, vanished immediately after a day of use, it arrives perfectly at the end of the day while stressing Massimo.
4873	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Agata	5	iPhones	2018-07-06	it	I was very hesitant to buy an item of such important value online. Then read the reviews I decided to buy. In fact the item arrived in a sealed box. It works well, delivery was made one day earlier than expected; there was a lot of savings. I can hardly say but: everything is perfect!
4874	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Jose	5	The product is a guarantee.	2018-01-28	it	I obviously found myself very well, but having had iPhone 4s and 6 before this 8, it couldn't be that way. Delivery was fast and ... I don't think there is anything else to add. Excellent Apple support, of which unfortunately I needed because my phone had a problem. I was replaced with a new one, but I already had this confirmed. Apple even if it costs more, from this point of view it is a guarantee.
4875	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Enzo	5	Excellent i ... entry	2018-12-25	it	iphone is always a great choice, versatile and complete; in the case of the SE model also compact and handy. I use it mainly for phone calls and / or watsapp, but it's also convenient for the internet. great product! super recommended. With Amazon all o.k.
4876	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Cliente Amazon	5	Fantastic!	2017-10-06	it	Arrived only two days after the purchase, even before the estimated delivery date. With the tracking code of the package provided by them, just go to the courier's website and you can immediately see how far they are. The product inside the package (in its original box with all intact Apple seals) was well packaged in a box filled with polystyrene to keep it away from bumps and shocks and with the stickers that they claimed to handle it with care. The product is the original and has no flaws. Much more than satisfied! Very good seller! In addition, the 64gb iPhone 8 I bought sells it at a lower price than the one offered in the apple store. If I need after sales support we will see, but as they were in the sale I would say fantastic!
4877	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	domenico soprano	2	Excellent shipping but otherwise we are not there ....	2017-10-06	it	Attention before buying it is not an Italian brand but European unfortunately the seller should tell her these things ....... I noticed by opening the box came out the plug with the American socket ... then the rest is ok phone arrived a day before shipping as established on Amazon
4878	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Sara	5	I love it	2018-01-10	it	I love this product, I have always been a lover of iPhones and as usual the site is very reliable, it allows us to have a technologically advanced product at a reasonable price. Council
4879	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	michele di fronzo	5	For those who want to know EVERYTHING	2017-10-26	it	iPhone 8? Three things: charging, grip and sound from the speakers. Which are not really aspects of the smartphone, but features added to the macro-features that already exist: autonomous charging, design grip and multimedia audio. There would be a little drawing to do, so simple to explain. IPhone 8, nice but always the same design since 2015iPhone 8, beautiful but still the same design since 20151. Top-up (wireless) I put wireless charging first because it's the only feature I'm already missing. It seems stupid and of little use, but having a support base on which to instantly load your smartphone is not foolish. For the occasion, I bought a recharge base on Amazon for € 9.99, which I placed on my bedside table in the bedroom. I don't know if it makes sense to take this base on the road, because it would only be something more to carry that would not give a real added value, compared to the normal USB-Lightning cable. I noticed that, with a cable, the iPhone 8 recharges 100% in about 1 hour, and with wireless charging in just under 2, but with the latter method the glass body behind warms up considerably. If it heats up in this period that the outside temperature is at maximum 28 degrees, I can only imagine what could happen in the summer with 40 degrees and more. In any case, wireless charging is very useful, especially since Apple has decided not to create its own standard, but to use the Qi standard which is very widespread.Grip, better with the iPhone 8 backside, grip is better with the shell rear in iPhone 8 glass, the grip is better with the rear body in glass I am trying out iPhone 8 while I look at that frying pan of the iPhone 7 Plus that I bought last year and which now seems terribly inefficient in terms of size. It almost seems that today, after all these models of smartphones with FullVision displays, InfinityDisplay and so on and so forth, "going back" to a smartphone with even a few millimeters of edges is like being back in 2003. As I have already written in the Galaxy S8 review, iPhone 7 Plus looks ugly and old to me. iPhone 8 has the exact same form factor as its predecessor, yet the rear glass body removes a bit of bitterness in the mouth. It is not just a matter of appearance: iPhoneItalia dear Andrea Cervone recently released a video on Youtube which clearly shows that glass resists all kinds of falls, and only yields to absurd falls - like those from a balcony.iPhone 8 doesn't seem to break even if you kick it and hit it against a tree. Seeing is believing. I obviously haven't tried it. Last, but not least, is the audio: it seems that many producers have made up their minds to turn their laptop and smartphone into speakers, because even iPhone 8 earns a good percentage more decibels, if we can say so. The volume is higher than the previous ones and the Galaxy S8, and it's really clean. Yes, it could be a reason to switch to iPhone 8, but not for me for example. And then? IPhone 8 actually has changes under the shell. But they are not very relevant. There is the new A11 Bionic chip, which has a dedicated processor for machine learning (but now is of little use), there is also a renewed camera that takes photos and shoots videos 2% better than the iPhone 7. And on iPhone 8 Plus there is the dual camera with which you can use Portrait Lighting, a mode that acts in real time on the portrait and highlights it, or puts it in black and white, and so on. For now, though, they're all games, the real applications that can take advantage of the A11 Bionic chip are still work in progress. I have said that neither iPhone 8 nor iPhone X are the real news from Apple, because Apple's direction is on reality (increased) - even Valentino, in his article, delves into augmented reality and the iPhone. In short, iPhone 8 is a small step forward, because one step was necessary to do so. Of course, 50% of iPhone users are waiting for the iPhone X because it is the most expensive smartphone for consumers in history (I don't count special editions and luxury smartphones). So, in a nutshell: if you come from iPhone 6 or earlier, iPhone 8 will be a big step forward. Otherwise, go ahead: the revolution has yet to come.

4881	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	QuintoFabioMassimo	2	Almost perfect...	2018-04-08	it	Beyond the not so modest price, it is certainly one of the best smartphones on the market ... too bad that it has only one flaw: PESA TOO!

4884	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Davide	5	Small compared to the average and easy to handle	2019-04-27	it	Waiting for the new generation IPhone SE (hoping to come out) is the top in terms of handling and pleasure of use
4885	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	MARCO AMOROSIA	5	Good purchase	2019-07-02	it	The phone is brand new, Italian too. Perfect from all points of view.

4887	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Guido	5	An icon	2019-07-08	it	In truth, I bought the phone for a friend who wanted to make a gift. Perfect item with fast shipping. For the rest, very little to say, iPhon is a certainty in terms of quality ... the rest? Either you hate it or you love it !!
4888	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	francodipisa	5	Good purchase	2019-07-13	it	Excellent in all respects!
4889	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Miki	5	Very reliable.	2019-07-08	it	A mobile phone that already has the same one, I made a gift, and whoever received it is very happy, even the affordable price, as usual with Amazon I never wrong, thanks!
4890	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	ROBERTA C.	5	Iphone 8 gray sidereal	2019-01-10	it	Purchased at Christmas with an offer (sold and sent by Amazon) for 548 euros ... very welcome gift result. Excellent performance and great price. Article as described.
4891	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Francesco	5	apple a guarantee, even for the price	2019-07-07	it	I purchased this iPhone 8 gold as a gift for my daughter, who was enthusiastic about it. In terms of aesthetics, it is very beautiful, compared to my Samsung S9 it is obviously more robust and more protected than the screen. Very easy to install with a special app to download everything as installed on the Android phone he had before. Very high photo quality, good sound. The only negative points in my opinion are the locked memory (it is not possible to insert additional memory cards, this is a half scam to draw money) and the price really too high to be already over 2 years old.
4892	iPhone 8	64GB	Gray	Luigi	1	Product badly assembled !!	2019-07-12	it	I am very disappointed that I would never have expected such a big flaw from such a costly and high quality product! apart from the aesthetic problem there is also the functional one, the phone should be resistant to splashes but I have my doubts about the waterproofing in that point since there is a nice crack, besides it fills up a lot of dust because the thin frame of plastic between glass and body is protruding, and retains dust.
4893	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Kris	5	Exceptional Apple product	2018-02-04	it	Aesthetically beautiful, the rear glass allows an excellent grip even though the smartphone is rather large in size. Ultra-finished LCD screen, true tone really makes the difference. Photo in portrait mode is really good with the possibility of editing before shooting. 8 plus from a 7 plus is not convenient, in all other cases I recommend it. For myself it is better than X, both for reliability (product already tested and with functionality similar to the cousin greater) and for the price much more affordable .
4894	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Quintino Renni	5	Apple iPhone 8 Plus.	2018-04-04	it	The iPhone 8 Plus, I think it's the best smartphone on the market. The product has endless and excellent capabilities and meets my expectations in full. I will be delighted to use it for a long time.
4895	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Seçil	5	Quality changeover, battery with excellent autonomy, smartphone resistant to falls	2019-03-07	it	I made the transition from iPhone 6 to iPhone 8 Plus because the performance and speed of the previous one had become really questionable. With the 8 Plus everything is perfect, the speed is excellent, the performance and autonomy are ideal, obviously the last sti stabilizes after a few days of use when the system recognizes your average usage. Visually, the iPhone 8 is really big but it looks good in the hand, obviously with a good cover, otherwise it slips. The back is now made of glass, which on the one hand is very nice to look at, but on the other hand a potential weak spot and repair of the glass are the risks. Apple uses the A11 Bionic chip on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which puts all the other opponents in the shade.- the camera is probably one of the highlights of the new IPhone 8 Plus. It has a dual 12 MP camera and a 7 MP front camera. Here it is really very possible. The 4K recordings, the vertical mode and the live photos are some keywords. - Touch ID is back on board, this will no longer be the case with the iPhone X. For me, this was a reason not to take the iPhone X, but rather the 8 Plus, since I'm so used to the Touch ID.- the battery should, according to the manufacturer, similar to the 7 Plus, allow about 21 hours of talk time, up to 13 hours of Internet use, 14 hours of video playback and 60 hours of audio playback. Of course, I didn't do these tests in practice, but I can say that the battery lasts all day, I leave the house at 7 in the morning, and when I go to bed in the evening at 11 pm, I still have between 15% and 25% battery .- with iOS 11 already installed, the command center has been reworked and you can configure it yourself. I consider it a great advantage because I can choose what I need and what I don't do. - the screen and the back are covered with an anti-grease layer that makes fingerprints less evident. Compared to the Galaxy S8 of my girlfriend, I can even confirm it.- for me it is a disadvantage that Apple renounces the iPhone 7 and now the 8 on the jack connection. I use my iPhone while driving a car as a navigation device and I also listen to music via iPhone. With my 6 series, I was able to connect the AUX cable and charge the device at the same time. This is now possible only through special accessories, for which you must also spend money again. - the quick charge function on the iPhone 8 is also accessible only if you are ready to spend another 90 ¬ vouchers for the power supply and the charging cable Concluding, I can say that I do not regret at all the leap in quality because we notice how old my iPhone 6 has become. I am very enthusiastic about the speed of my new 8 Plus and the autonomy of its battery compared to my previous phone.
4896	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	AlfMart	5	Fantastic	2018-02-28	it	As always, iPhone is a guarantee, I come from a 6s plus and I must say that despite the aesthetics is practically the same internally it is much faster in daily use, record-breaking battery life virtually endless! Wireless charging compatible with other non-Apple devices which to say absolutely recommended !!
4897	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Donato	5	iphone 8 plus	2018-02-15	it	product arrived a day in advance (even if it is to wait two weeks) the phone comes in its original box complete with accessories. for the moment all is well done congratulations to Digitech P.
4898	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Mauro 58	3	Present	2019-02-09	it	Purchased as a farewell gift for a retired colleague. Little to say about the quality of the phone, which I think everyone knows (though personally I don't share Apple's constructive philosophy), but which - in my opinion - still has a cost too high compared to at the age of the model.
4899	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	GP	2	Is it an original Apple ??	2019-06-06	it	A long list of inexplicable malfunctions, so much so that I suspected it to be a chinoiserie with a fake Apple logo. I don't know any owner of Iphone that is dissatisfied like me, besides I have owned for years 2 Mac Book, 1 other Iphone for children and an Ipad Air 2, but nothing works so badly. I have not yet brought him in assistance because I have to get a replacement; I saved a little compared to direct purchase from Apple, but never from retailers that are not more than safe. Based on the response of the authorized assistance, I will evaluate a return with refund.
4900	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Ivana Pagliero Valgrand	5	Great phone	2018-09-15	it	Fantastic phone, I have been using it for just over a week and I must say, being my first iPhone, that Apple quality can be seen! I ordered it through Digitech P, delivery times respected (you have to wait a little longer than others, but for the value for money it is absolutely worth it), and moreover full availability of the seller: there had been a communication error in the shipping tracking code, and he promptly contacted me within a few hours of my request of information, communicating to me the new one; in short, everything perfect
4901	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	giorgio b	4	iOS has its downsides, white not black	2018-08-19	it	It works fine, but I've found that even iOS isn't perfect. For example I would gladly do without iTunes, or I would like to know why, if I have to upload a song I have to make the slow backup. Besides, I had asked for white and they gave me black.
4902	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Miriam	5	Fantastic	2018-03-27	it	I purchased my iPhone 8 plus for € 200 less than the original price! Shipping a little too long, but it's worth it.
4903	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Crishan	5	Great	2018-02-16	it	Excellent new sealed product, I have been using it for 2 months at the moment it has given me no problem, I recommend it.
4904	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Gray	Matteo Spedo	5	Excellent purchase	2018-09-27	it	Tested for a month, great phone, the extra mememoria is heard in case it is used very frequently to keep documents and apps related to work, actually the dimensions are quite important for a phone however for my personal taste and size of hands it's perfect, great buy, recommended.
4905	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Insegna dell'anno	1	Iphone 8 plus	2019-02-06	it	Received a few days ago. I'm learning to use it anyway, the battery runs out quickly even with minimum brightness. It's hard to hold because it's big. (The size of the display is not the one indicated by amazon.) I give you a tip: PLAY ON IPHONE X- XR- XS. AVOID IPHONE 7, 7 PLUS, 8, 8 PLUS.
4906	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Ena k	4	If you love technology you have to buy it!	2017-12-21	it	Great product as a Christmas gift for lovers of technological innovations, excellent product even if the price is high even if Amazon costs me less.
4907	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	LARA VINCIARELLI	5	I love it	2019-05-21	it	Arrived today, perfect. As if it had been bought in the shop. Well packed and protected, absolutely original Apple. As for the phone itself, it is wonderful. It promises well. Inside the box is everything you would find in the store , ie phone, headphones and charger. Beautiful phone
4908	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Gray	Laura Ciarmatori	5	Excellent	2018-07-11	it	The phone is a bomb, it works great and takes very nice pictures. Furthermore, having 256GB is exceptional. Parcel delivered with long times, but we already knew.
4909	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	PIETRO	5	Iphone 8 plus	2018-07-09	it	What to say. Excellent quality of customer service and courtesy shown. The product is absolutely compliant with the request and the price is very competitive compared to competitors. Almost, I buy another one.

4941	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	luca	1	apple iphone 8plus	2018-07-24	it	without making unnecessary controversy the seller refused the reimbursement request saying that it was out of time (I don't think I bought it on 19 July) and that the phone had been registered in my name: but to verify the correct functioning of the product it must be activated and I found some problems with the software but since I was in warranty I turned to an apple center in the area where I live that very kindly fix it after this adventure I will not buy anything on amazon
4942	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Raffaele	4	An iPhone with endless battery!	2018-10-31	it	INTRODUCTION I bought the iPhone 8 plus to replace my "old" iPhone 7. I was looking for a device that had a bigger screen, but above all a larger battery. With the 8 plus I realized my dreams: with intense use, which also includes watching videos, I arrive quietly from 6.45am to midnight with at least a 20% charge. Congratulations to Apple! TIP The phone is completely made of glass. I recommend buying a protective cover of good quality because it is easily subject to scratches and marks. Both the back and the shell!
4943	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Giovy	5	Superb	2017-11-13	it	Simply iPhone that say perfect the best of all the phones in the world once you have it you do not do without it
4944	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Armando01	4	Time passes but it seems to hold up	2019-03-19	it	I purchased this smartphone in September 2017, paid around € 900 was one of the top of the range, still the price remains quite high compared to others. In this period of time he gave me few problems, but in the last period the battery is slightly failing, but I honestly believe that despite the various models released after, the 8 plus still remains in the medium-high range.
4945	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Melina Sol	4	Arrived earlier than expected	2018-11-13	it	Beautiful, fast shipping, complete with everything. (Chargers, headphones, protective films and adapter) The only flaw is that it has a tiny scratch on the side of the phone. We'll see the performance later!
4946	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Brigida	4	It was worth it!! WONDERFUL !!	2018-12-07	it	The phone is gorgeous, it's 100% original !! I was wary at the beginning. I didn't feel like buying this mobile on Amazon. But then I changed my mind and decided to order it. Shipping times were a bit long but not so long, it was worth it !!! If you want an iPhone 8 Plus, I recommend buying it here. At least you can save 120 euros.
4947	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Giugee	5	Great!!	2018-11-08	it	Punctual seller, the phone arrived even earlier than expected, intact and 100% working. The only thing was the external box, a little ruined, but the one that contained the iPhone was perfect. Council
4948	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	5	Good	2018-12-31	it	Perfect everything except the fact that I waited almost 2 weeks when it had to arrive earlier
4949	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	rosario	5	Product information	2018-11-12	it	Product arrived half a day in advance all sealed perfect I highly recommend the purchase
4950	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	5	Delivery	2018-12-07	it	The time of consignment is one of the best ... but the rest are optimal.
4951	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Andrea	5	Good	2018-11-11	it	Arrived immediately and in good condition.
4952	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Argent 	Paolo Garrone	5	Good support	2017-12-20	it	I don't think the product needs reviews, like all iPhones is a good product, then everyone has their own tastes and preferences. 8 and not X for prowess against new technologies and for being able to buy a plus. The retailer was very kind in being able to trace the parcel and block it because, a little because under Christmas, partly because the GLS courier is perhaps not the best, there was some delivery problem. However the retailer responds, it helps for which nothing to complain.
4953	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Yanny	5	Amazon client	2018-03-28	it	I love it and I am very happy I had never used ifhone and I must say that I really love it 100%
4954	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Fra	5	Great product	2018-03-07	it	The size at the beginning seemed to me excessive but then in use it is very comfortable. I am very satisfied with the purchase. I arrived at the set times.
4955	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Lucia G	5	satisfied	2018-12-08	it	The bigger screen of the plus is something exceptional ... I don't think I'll come back. Obviously it takes the bag to carry it back because in the pockets of the trousers it does not fit very well ... then anyway Apple reviews itself for the rest
4956	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	sandra buganza	5	A wonderful little computer	2018-08-04	it	Perfect. Complete with everything, arrived even earlier than expected. It's a gem, the photos are beautiful, and so are the videos, where you can use the zoom without losing sharpness.
4957	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Alemagione	5	Fantastic!	2018-07-22	it	What to say. TOP product of the TOP. Extremely expensive but unparalleled. I saved some money thanks to the offer I found on Amazon. Perfect service as always.
4958	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Alessandro	5	Top	2019-05-22	it	I think there is no need for a description ... after more than a year I am always satisfied
4959	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Lesmine	5	Perfect	2018-08-03	it	Perfect
4960	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Luigi	4	Apple iPhone 8 Plus 64 gb	2017-11-17	it	Despite sending technical problems communicated to me by Amazon, I received the product in a timely manner, despite a rapid request and therefore declining a star. As regards the product in question, it arrived perfectly packaged, unbranded and, after performing the simple Configuration maneuvers worked and still works very well. I have a certain age (now advanced) and I have used multiple brands, but (although a little expensive) Apple products have never betrayed me. This therefore deserves all five stars.
4961	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	elena conti	5	Original product and fast shipping	2018-03-04	it	Original product, I'm trying it and I'm very satisfied for now. The dimensions are bigger than my previous iPhone, but I'm getting used to it. The shipment was very fast, I received it 2 days after the order. Before the scheduled date. Thanks, great service.
4962	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Luca	4	Fantastic phone	2017-12-19	it	It's the first time I buy an iPhone. Great phone really very good, fantastic aesthetics especially the glass back. Good packaging, received in new box sealed with charger and earphone jack and female jack adapter. I put 4 stars because the telelfono has software / hardware problems so I will have to resort to the 1 year apple warranty. I think it's a phone problem and the seller has nothing to do with it. So very positive feedback.
4963	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	radicchia11	4	Excellent iPhone, delayed delivery of the retailer	2018-05-16	it	Very happy with this iPhone 8 plus, which I prefer clearly to the iPhone X. The classic Apple design is always splendid (without the ugly black tab of the iPhone X that causes problems with the display of the texts when it is horizontal) and I'm happy both returned to the glass back. I prefer not to use wireless charging to prevent the phone from overheating. Great screen even without oled technology, beautiful colors even from the camera sensor, beautiful and natural the background blur effect with the portrait function. With the new A11 Bionic Chip the phone is very fast and very responsive. The only flaw: the delivery, for which Amazon was not responsible, but the retailer. At the last moment, on the finishing line, they changed the day of delivery to postpone it to the following week. I was without a tel because my previous one had failed, and it was a job damage. They didn't even apologize.
4964	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	lino sabato	5	Very satisfied	2017-12-09	it	Great phone, very fluid and powerful. Coming from an iPhone 5 the difference is even more remarkable. The only flaw is the weight, I would have liked to give up the glass back to get a few grams less, but it seems to be necessary for wireless charging.
4965	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	alberto	5	great	2018-02-06	it	excellent bumper .. protects the necessary without ruining the aesthetics of the telophone. perfect for those who maybe hate covers and want something small
4966	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	michele di fronzo	5	Really a pretty sight	2017-11-07	it	iPhone 8? Three things: charging, grip and sound from the speakers. Which are not really aspects of the smartphone, but features added to the macro-features that already exist: autonomous charging, design grip and multimedia audio. There would be a little drawing to do, so simple to explain. IPhone 8, nice but always the same design since 2015iPhone 8, beautiful but still the same design since 20151. Top-up (wireless) I put wireless charging first because it's the only feature I'm already missing. It seems stupid and of little use, but having a support base on which to instantly load your smartphone is not foolish. For the occasion, I bought a recharge base on Amazon for € 9.99, which I placed on my bedside table in the bedroom. I don't know if it makes sense to take this base on the road, because it would only be something more to carry that would not give a real added value, compared to the normal USB-Lightning cable. I noticed that, with a cable, the iPhone 8 recharges 100% in about 1 hour, and with wireless charging in just under 2, but with the latter method the glass body behind warms up considerably. If it heats up in this period that the outside temperature is at maximum 28 degrees, I can only imagine what could happen in the summer with 40 degrees and more. In any case, wireless charging is very useful, especially since Apple has decided not to create its own standard, but to use the Qi standard which is very widespread.Grip, better with the iPhone 8 backside, grip is better with the shell rear in iPhone 8 glass, the grip is better with the rear body in glass I am trying out iPhone 8 while I look at that frying pan of the iPhone 7 Plus that I bought last year and which now seems terribly inefficient in terms of size. It almost seems that today, after all these models of smartphones with FullVision displays, InfinityDisplay and so on and so forth, "going back" to a smartphone with even a few millimeters of edges is like being back in 2003. As I have already written in the Galaxy S8 review, iPhone 7 Plus looks ugly and old to me. iPhone 8 has the exact same form factor as its predecessor, yet the rear glass body removes a bit of bitterness in the mouth. It is not just a matter of appearance: iPhoneItalia dear Andrea Cervone recently released a video on Youtube which clearly shows that glass resists all kinds of falls, and only yields to absurd falls - like those from a balcony.iPhone 8 doesn't seem to break even if you kick it and hit it against a tree. Seeing is believing. I obviously haven't tried it. Last, but not least, is the audio: it seems that many producers have made up their minds to turn their laptop and smartphone into speakers, because even iPhone 8 earns a good percentage more decibels, if we can say so. The volume is higher than the previous ones and the Galaxy S8, and it's really clean. Yes, it could be a reason to switch to iPhone 8, but not for me for example. And then? IPhone 8 actually has changes under the shell. But they are not very relevant. There is the new A11 Bionic chip, which has a dedicated processor for machine learning (but now is of little use), there is also a renewed camera that takes photos and shoots videos 2% better than the iPhone 7. And on iPhone 8 Plus there is the dual camera with which you can use Portrait Lighting, a mode that acts in real time on the portrait and highlights it, or puts it in black and white, and so on. For now, though, they're all games, the real applications that can take advantage of the A11 Bionic chip are still work in progress. I have said that neither iPhone 8 nor iPhone X are the real news from Apple, because Apple's direction is on reality (increased) - even Valentino, in his article, delves into augmented reality and the iPhone. In short, iPhone 8 is a small step forward, because one step was necessary to do so. Of course, 50% of iPhone users are waiting for the iPhone X because it is the most expensive smartphone for consumers in history (I don't count special editions and luxury smartphones). So, in a nutshell: if you come from iPhone 6 or earlier, iPhone 8 will be a big step forward. Otherwise, go ahead: the revolution has yet to come.
4967	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gray	Giuseppe	4	Iphone 8 plus used "" as new "".	2019-07-13	it	Bought used reported in the description "" as new "" and without any indication of scratches. Upon receipt I notice that it has small scratches in the upper and lower part of the frame. At least they could represent the presence of the aforementioned scratches and sell it for a few dozen less euros. However good product.
4968	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	vale f	3	iPhone 8 Silver	2018-12-28	it	Found after a week to much less. Arrived early
4969	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Adriano	5	Super!	2018-12-26	it	We're talking about a great phone. I am very well.
4970	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Michele R.	1	Absent seller	2018-08-23	it	After 1 year and little more than the order, the phone suddenly shows no signs of life. Contact the seller being still within the warranty time (2 years from law) impossible to contact the seller (euroglobal). I do not recommend ...
4971	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	5	Super efficient	2018-04-18	it	I had ordered this phone on April 4 and two days later I had already arrived. No problem, I had contacted the seller previously and I arrived early. Except that at the time of the FIRST ignition, then immediately after having discarded the phone presented a defect: a small blue dot inside the screen. I contacted the salesman who immediately replied telling me to send them details and everything and that on Tuesday he would send Bartolini to pick it up for the return. Being in right of withdrawal I didn't have to pay anything and the seller (CDS) took care of everything and I was sent back exactly two days later. After one week it works perfectly and I didn't see any problems. I am super enthusiastic and the products are original. Thank you for the availability of the seller and for having fulfilled all my doubts or requests and I am sure that in very few sellers they behave this way. Really professional and super efficient, I still bought from them.
4972	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Miriam Gratelvus	3	Great product, but ghost seller.	2018-10-02	it	On the iPhone I have nothing to say, but unfortunately I told the seller that at the time of delivery I wanted the receipt for any problem and in any case a guarantee. The seller didn't send me anything, but after my reports he sent me a photo of a receipt with that price of course null. So on the product they send 5 stars because Apple has always been Excellence For me, while the ghost seller gives me practically a star. In fact I don't know how to balance the review. This time Amazon downloads the barrel to the seller who, as I have already said, is absent. So if you want to buy, take into account that despite the fact that by law there are two years of warranty, this product is only one year with Apple because the second year given by the seller does not exist. Fortunately I still had no problems.
4973	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Federica Di Giulio	1	very bad	2018-07-14	it	I had a problem with the phone and no one just spun off the barrel the seller never gave an answer .. although I still had the guarantee .. never again !!!!!!
4974	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Symod38	5	Excellent!	2018-04-19	it	Still in 2018 with top-of-the-range features! Today it is probably a best buy in the world of smartphones together with the 6S and the legendary SE.There is not much to say except "" iPhone "". Crazy quality as usual, impeccable device. Obviously the new iPhone 8 and X will have more performance and cutting-edge technology, despite this, the 7 is still a real Mr. iPhone.Consigliatissimo.
4975	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	5	Happy son!	2019-01-19	it	Original, new and arrived in perfect condition! Thank you
4976	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Edoardo	3	Good product, shame the charger!	2018-06-18	it	Item arrived earlier than the estimated date of purchase. The phone is in good condition and even the signs of wear, mentioned in the offer, are so small as to be considered irrelevant. Only flaw found the charger is not original (cinesata). I wonder why the seller can save on an element of fundamental importance?
4977	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Gianfranco	5	Iphone 7 - Good smartphone	2018-12-15	it	Hard to write a review on something that has very few flaws. Let's start by saying that the battery really surprised me, I won't go into the technical details but I must say that it keeps quietly more than a day and is very fast in the charging phase. The screen is, in my opinion, the right size for both word processing and multimedia content, and if we add to this the fact that it is really light, it does not bother you and is not at all cumbersome. The sacrifice of the cable Jack I think it was apt to improve the sound power thanks to the introduction of a second speaker. Another nice new feature is the home button, which no longer gives the impression that the whole screen is touch. In all honesty I was used to the old key, but with this we "" become attached "" the same. On the operating system I spend a few words but all positive because IOs 12 is not giving me any trouble either from the point of view of compatibility with apps and other devices and with battery life. Finally I think they have improved the design a lot by removing the unpleasant step that had the 6 (the step was due to the antenna) thus giving the phone a more serious and compact design.
4978	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Marco	5	iPhone 7 32gb matte black	2018-12-08	it	Bought in September 2018 and still currently one of the best phones, much faster than the 6 and with new technologies that only Apple offers, thin, light, compact, excellent battery and for € 470 was a bargain. In my opinion there is no reason to take L 8 and if you are undecided go to 7 as these last 2 are the last with the very comfortable Touch ID and with the new physical key. In short, for me it remains the best price-quality iPhone even in 2018 since the new ones are bigger and only have Face ID and cost a salary!
4979	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	ORNELLA	3	I DO NOT KNOW	2018-09-14	it	I bought last year. My I phone for over a month does not turn on when I charge it; I already bought three charger cables but nothing! Now I don't know how to get it checked! Does Amazon check it? I asked for Apple assistance and was told that I have to contact Amazon and I don't know how to proceed. The fact is that my IPhone does not turn on !!
4980	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	1	Bad purchase	2018-12-02	it	After a year and a half of use, the iPhone presented a fault which was found to be the result of a manufacturing defect. Although the seller's guarantee provided for them to be collected, checked by Apple and repaired, I was not able to obtain this withdrawal and therefore the defect remains our responsibility. Do not make expensive purchases online to save a few euros, you risk losing a lot more than if you had bought it in the store, like us.
4981	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Alessandra Battaglia	2	Refurbished iPhone 7	2018-09-08	it	Delivery was timely. First disappointment: the accessories. The cable and the socket are there, but they do not work well, there are no aricles. Positive note: a protection has been added to the screen. The phone is not externally in very good condition as it was written in the description. Whoever owned it before me must never have used a cover because the phone has a dent in every corner. As far as the operation is concerned, the phone goes very well, I see no difference between the new and the reconditioned. The battery seems to me Discrete.
4982	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Matteo	1	Shameful	2019-04-29	it	After finding problems related to the operation of the iPhone 7 sound card, being still under legal warranty (2 years), I tried to contact the Globalphone S.R.L.S. seller requesting the repair, replacement or return of the product. In addition to never having replied to me, the seller has never acknowledged either the amazon operators or the consumer protection association. I therefore find myself with a non-working mobile phone, as useful as a broomstick I would love to use on those of Globalphone.
4983	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Fdk	5	what to say is an Apple	2019-01-06	it	what to say, it's an Apple. Although a bit obsolete it is preferable to iPhone 8 for many reasons including the price. iPhone 8 still has an excessive price and compared to 7 it only allows "wireless" charging and a slightly more powerful processor. The lags on the iPhone 8 are still considerable compared to 7. the screen is small, unfortunately
4984	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	EFEDER	5	Fantastic!	2017-12-27	it	Fantastic smartphone even if at the moment there are more recent products. Great price of around 150 euros less than the official Apple store.
4985	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Vincenzo	3	Apple: a clearly overrated brand	2019-04-22	it	Ever since the iPhone 6 came out, I've always wanted to buy one, but I've always considered them "unreachable" because of their disproportionate prices, but some time ago, when I saw the iPhone 7 Plus, I fell in love with it, so I began to consider the reconditioned 16-gigabyte iPhone 6, precisely because even the new 6 / 6S cost so much (it costs so much even today, compared to its release date) also because I needed to buy a new smartphone, but since I am a man of great patience, I have waited months and months and in the end, having the possibility of being able to spend a little more, I bought here on Amazon the 32 gig iPhone, at a price of € 411.14 (it was on offer , at full price, even today, the 32 gig model costs almost € 500) with the awareness of the multiple limitations that Apple products have, that this iPhone 7 is now technologically obsolete (we are talking about a 2016 device) and for the trouble that I have had since not po ssiedo an Apple ecosystem, but I bought it because they are better than most Android devices because of their hardware / software optimization and because I love the graphics / effects / fluidity of the iOS system, but in a short time I regretted having it purchased. Why? Even though like everyone, I have always been aware of the limitations that an iPhone entails, trying it for myself, I realized that Apple's is a real dictatorship: or you adapt to their absurd rules / limitations or not if does nothing! Making simple operations, such as transferring files from the iPhone to the PC and vice versa, really becomes a mangy procedure. When I was recording a voice message via the WhatsApp App, the phone warmed up a bit behind, and I don't think that was normal. After almost a month that I had it, I discovered that my copy was "" affected "" by the so-called "Coil Whine" effect, that is the noise that you can hear by resting your ear near the applied Apple logo on the back of the device itself. When I was talking on the phone while it was plugged in, I could hear a sort of interference noise from the earpiece, like those that emit radios when an old phone came up. Always the ear-plug, it gave out a remarkable rustling while I was on call. Finally, only with a few Apps and a quantity of music that went just beyond the jig, I had already arrived at about 22 gigabytes. Unfortunately, all these things have led me to make the return and return to Android, with which I can do everything with extreme simplicity, but above all it is a device that is more recent than two years, has more memory, moreover expandable, is borderless (full screen) and it cost me less. I love the graphics and fluency of iOS, but the game is not worth the candle!
4986	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	NAME_NOT_RETURNED	5	First phone did not work the SIM, but the second one WORKS PERFECTLY	2018-05-31	it	I got the first iPhone, it didn't read the SIMs, the problem was reported to the retailer who offered to be called after office hours. this problem occurred on a Friday evening, so the faulty piece was picked up on Monday and another new iPhone was delivered on Friday of the same week.
4987	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	KungFu66	5	iPhone 7 da Amazon Warehouse	2019-07-01	it	Purchased used "" as new "" directly from Amazon, but if it were not for the unsealed box you would not understand that it is not a new product. In the box there were also all the original accessories.A very good phone at a price just above a reconditioned.Battery that never gives problems, even in days of heavy use.Ordered in the evening to replace a reconditioned with broken antenna and not repairable, and delivered the next morning. PS eye to the origin of the reconditioned iPhone 7 because it seems that the breaking of the antenna is very frequent when they come from China and the United States (and in Italy there is no recall program).
4988	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	5	iPhone 7 128Gb	2017-09-08	it	Is Apple's iPhone 7 something to add? Those who love the apple already know what we are talking about .. whoever hates it too !! Amazon impeccable .. perfect product!
4989	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Cesare	5	The best smartphone with the most efficient operating system	2018-10-09	it	Probably the best old generation iPhone left over. Too bad that Apple's updates on older devices always bring some new limitations and a reduction in battery capacity
4990	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Silvio	5	I advise!	2017-12-05	it	Iphone purchased for my girlfriend, who will replace a samsung. Unquestionable apple quality. Product arrived perfectly packed and with all standard accessories. Very satisfied.
4991	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Alberto	5	All right	2018-09-08	it	Product arrived after a long wait (but it had been foreseen since the purchase) but in advance on the delivery date. For the rest, everything is ok, it works great like all iPhones (and compared to the new ones it is lighter and more manageable, but not much less powerful).
4992	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Sara c.	1	VOLATILIZED SELLER	2019-03-24	it	SELLER LOST IN ANYTHING. After a year the phone is no longer going. Legally I am entitled to a 24 month warranty ... but Digital Kingdom has disappeared into thin air. Untraceable. I strongly advise against it
4993	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	5	guaranteed efficiency and punctuality	2018-08-20	it	I am very satisfied with the Apple iPhone 7 Smartphoe 4G received via Amazon on time for delivery and efficient storage of the product, intact and in line with my expectations!

Not to mention the screen with excellent backlighting and always clear colors. I recommend the 32 GB version to anyone because it is the right compromise between quantity and price. The operating system always reliable and with an initial phase of fast and intuitive setup, the only thing that really irritated me is that this Iphone (and I believe also the following ones) does not allow you to complete the initial setting if you do not introduce the SIM (which is the smaller version of the usual micro sim, that is the nano sim).

The only flaw the charger was defective and did not work, we wrote immediately although we knew it was the week of August. Then having to leave for the holidays we went to the Apple store and replaced it immediately. The seller replied only yesterday, after 15 days saying to contact the apple because they could not replace the accessory, for this reason I evaluate the customer assistance just enough (even considering that it was August).

Original Apple product with all the accessories. The only flaw is that I thought it would heat less in the back part that with a use even not intense tends to manifest overheating. For the rest, great product and excellent amazon prime.
5131	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Rocco zezza	5	Great deal thanks again from one to 10 (10 and praise)	2018-06-29	it	Hi, I just bought a 32gb iphone 7 on Amazon from Cellularishop and it went well. The phone arrived two days immediately after the order, that is with a positive speed, and it was a great deal, the cel was packed and nothing was missing ... there was everything (earphones, chargers etc ..). I sincerely thank Amazon and the store (cellularishop) delighted with the good price.
5132	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	4	Good but not very well	2017-08-21	it	Everything arrived in the right time, the package was a bit spoiled and the phone soon faded. I hope it's not reconditioned or something similar. However I think it is normal however after all I recommend it.
5133	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	4	Apple A1778 iPhone 7	2017-09-22	it	Powerful phone with excellent photography system, 128 Giga are now necessary for use without any problem

5138	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	4	battery	2017-06-24	it	I was hoping that the iPhone 7 had a longer battery life than the 6, but I think it's the same, better the camera
5139	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Vitelli Francesco M	4	2019 It is not waterproof and the battery is subject to rapid deterioration over time	2019-04-28	it	I purchased this device just released at the Apple store, it's aesthetically beautiful, it's fast and has a graphic that combined with its excellent camera can be a valid substitute for cameras. The memory remains non-expandable, a typical apple, and unfortunately the battery is subject to a rapid deterioration of time since after two years the performance has dropped exaggeratedly. It is not waterproof as it is advertised since, by reading the conditions in detail and experimenting, it is only resistant to splashes so the warranty does not cover damage from liquids. My device has also fallen from heights and has not suffered any damage. It is therefore very resistant to shocks and falls.
5140	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	matera 2019	4	Great product	2017-07-11	it	Great product, arrived earlier than expected. Closed incelofanato and carefully closed.Price then great for an iPhone 7 32 gbIf I were to recommend it, I would give a grade 9, I probably would have given a 10 only to 128 if it had had the same price. it is not just!
5141	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Carla D'Onofrio	5	trust	2017-03-11	it	Delivered in advance, excellent purchase given the savings of 110 euros, original iPhone. It was the first time I bought online for an important amount but I was very satisfied. IPhone 7 is extraordinary.
5142	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	penny penny	5	punctual	2016-12-16	it	The order arrived earlier than reported, which of course is always synonymous with correctness and professionalism. I had some hesitations in buying a cell phone online but I changed my mind: unopened package, model and brand correspond. ask for the invoice separately.
5143	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Claudia	5	iPhone 7 Jet Black 128gb	2017-04-15	it	Very high-performance phone, with crystal-clear audio and 2 speakers from which the bass feels good while listening to music, very nice also the very realistic push button, excellent 12mpx camera with 4k 30fps video. 1080p 120fps with external apps and 720p 240fps with external apps. I recommend the purchase. Package arrived 1 day in advance.
5144	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Ramsesvi	5	iPhone now an absolute security !!!!!	2017-01-04	it	I have waited for the right offer is that it was a product sent at least by Amazon for not having to deal with third-party vendors that could slow down the time in case you should take advantage of the guarantee. I chose the gold-colored 32 Gb model which is very elegant and fine. As for the technical specifications I am not here to list them as they are now well known. Many fluid usage, and coming from an IPhone 5S I immediately noticed the difference (even if only for the larger screen). A tip: take it immediately a cover that is open or closed, the price of the phone requires it; if you choose the classic clear transparent covers that have the upside that protects the rear camera.
5145	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	1	PACKAGE EMPTY !!!!!!!!!!!	2017-07-10	it	I have just ended the call with the amazon call center caller. Despite the long phone call the damage was not completely repaired. Today, on 10.7.- well beyond the maximum delivery date set by the first - I received the package ordered. The amazon packaging appeared to be intact, while once the package was opened, the iPhone box was cellophane-free and empty inside. The cellular device was missing, the cables and everything else boasted in the description of the product. The package is - or maybe I should say ERA - sold and shipped by amazon. As written, I immediately called the call center, which told me that there was no ready and equivalent substitute. The package contained a gift for a degree, to be celebrated on Thursday. Currently the situation in which it is paid is the following: - inability to place a new order for the equivalent product without added costs - inability to order a substitute to the product without further disbursements - damage from delay in delivery - damage from non-gift (as Thursday I will have to present myself at the unloaded degree of this). I thank Amazon for the unpleasant inconvenience to which it has not been able to give prompt repair and solution. You have certainly lost a customer. The justification "to err is human" is not, at present, sufficient. I strongly believe that I am the victim of a scam. By reserving the right to proceed, it is not advisable to order this product. I am still waiting for the supervisor's call.
5146	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Federico Grasso	5	My first iphone	2017-03-01	it	My first iPhone simply fantastic every detail is studied with the greatest attention to detail, excellent gesture that I did not know and the fake button with haptic feedback is amazing.
5147	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	5	Quality, kindness and communication not just. Seller hype!	2017-01-07	it	I was very satisfied with the availability given to me by the seller. It is difficult today to receive similar availability also in stores, considering the period of purchase and the cost with which I purchased a product that is not exactly 'cheap'. I would like to emphasize that due to a update not done when the phone was switched on, initially I had problems with the sound of the same. For this reason I was about to send the product back. Right from the start, the seller made himself available to solve the problem by planning a collection a few hours later, obviously in the manner and times most useful to both. Consider that I purchased this product at the end of the new year. Below I solved the problem by personally updating the phone software so as to restore the sound quality immediately absent. My suggestion to all buyers is to check and make, especially in products of this caliber, all the updates available for avoid unpleasant and unnecessary inconveniences on both sides. Communicate.
5148	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Anelli Andrea	5	Great smartphone, as always Apple number 1	2016-12-15	it	With Apple you are never wrong; excellent smartphone, very responsive, light, the s.o. is the best, as always, the battery lasts me 2 days abundant so I am fully satisfied! The phone arrived 4 days before the scheduled date, so also the delivery service was excellent, in addition to the really inviting price
5149	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	AleksejSg	5	It's not my favorite iPhone but almost!	2018-12-19	it	It's a beautiful product, light, amazing to look at, fast, I found the iPhone 8 a step backwards in design, ergonomics and lightness! On this device you already know everything, but who cares? It's always nice to reiterate how fantastic the camera is, the build quality, how much to have a device like that in your hands simplify your life, why shouldn't you love it? Design: 10/10, it's beautiful, period. Autonomy: 9/10, lasts a lot. Aesthetics: 10 / 10Reactivity: 9/10 Quality ratio new price 5/10 used 10/10 (easy to get it for 160 euros) Overall I love this smartphone and I invite you to try it yourself before issuing a judgment :)
5150	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	5	State of the art iPhone	2017-03-06	it	Delivery time respected and maximum product satisfaction, smartphone built "" at the state of the art "" very high rating in every respect, not least the price that is very advantageous through this seller.
5151	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Mirco Fiorelli	5	iPhone 7	2018-09-15	it	Really top smartphones nothing to say the product arrived quickly I am very satisfied we say that I only returned it to try S8. But to be honest, after a couple of weeks I regretted getting along well with this product, in turn I returned the S8 because it gave me audio problems and I bought back an iPhone 7. I don't want to criticize Samsung for products. happen that some devices can have defects and it's mine was one of those without taking anything away from S8 that as a device is really exceptional. Returning to the iPhone 7 I'm not the first to find out so the features are really endless for the voice assistant really good, maybe it would be better to have an offline function like for Android but otherwise the transition from Android to Ios is really satisfied for now it doesn't come back
5152	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Fabrizio	5	Iphone al TOP	2016-11-20	it	I state that I use Apple phones from 2012 with small pauses to try out the new Android operating systems, so I will try to be as objective as possible by making comparisons with Iphone 6 and 6s. Packaging and unboxing. The usual robust package of Apple phones, very simple with printed the back of the phone. Unboxing made easier by the fact that the plastic has a tab to tear off the protective plastic. Even the accidental drops have been averted because the phone is under the manuals. Inside the charger, cable, lightning cable to jack, lightning headphones, telephone of course. Materials and sensations to the touch. My phone is in Matt Black color. I have been using it for two months and compared to silver it is very noticeable the dirt. I'm not talking about fingerprints or anything like dust and lint that are noticeable compared to silver. But just clean it weekly. The feel is the usual one of Apple phones. Leaving out the 6 which gave me a feeling of little robustness (it bent success also to me) the 7 is robust like the 6s. Everything perfect, the usual obsessive care of Apple. User experience. Phone takes good, good sound in call. Also to listen to videos on youtube on 7 there are two speakers that give you the feeling of a fuller sound. The two boxes are positioned one next to the entrance of the lightning cable and the other next to the ear capsule. So phenomenal stereo sound like on no other phone. Ios 10 now with constant updates no longer suffers from tweaks that (albeit small) plagued the beta versions. Now Ios 10 appears mature and stable, with small innovations that will simplify the use making it more pleasant.3d Touch personally changed the use of the phone for the better I can not do without it. Last thing this iphone is waterproof so (also if you lose the guarantee) you will no longer have to worry if it falls into a puddle, for example. The telephone is fine, even if someone complains about small shutdowns and restarts, but it will only happen to me once in two months. Camera is the stabilizer optical for videos and more cleaning of photos. The 6s we say that he took pictures with a lot of noise in closed or poorly lit rooms. The 7 finally has a better camera. Battery I dedicate a separate section because there are improvements. I can do a day and a half with GPS and active bluetooth with average usage. Let's say that the stressful day surpasses it. Compared to the 6s improvements are there. Having said that, would you recommend it? If you come by 6 yes, you will be better off. Consider that the 6 has 1 GB of ram while the 7 has 2. In addition to the fact that it makes everything turn better. If you come from 6s no, you should wait for the next one. I sold the 6s and I took this but I'm a fan, I don't think it's normal for a normal user.
5153	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	ely3	5	ALL FANTASTIC!	2017-05-30	it	APPLE AND DIGITAL KINGDOM A GUARANTEE! IPhone purchased Friday afternoon and arrived Tuesday morning, nothing to complain. Fully satisfied, 5 stars deserved especially for the seller!

5155	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Davide	1	GREAT SELLER ATTENTION.	2017-10-04	it	I bought the phone, but after a couple of weeks it started to have problems with heating and wifi. On October 3, I submitted the return request, but the seller REFUSED because according to him on August 30th the 30-day period for the restitution.While in reality 27 have passed since the actual delivery as shown in the photo.Among the other Amazon, since he is not the direct seller, he is accepting his position. I made a further complaint and I am waiting for an answer ... but bad at the moment .. Something in Amazon is changing attention.
5156	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Anastasia	5	Present	2017-05-05	it	Purchased for a gift, fast shipping and perfect packaging, the person to whom I gave it did not encounter any problems and found itself very well with this device, recommended purchase.

5167	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Alessio Giannelli	5	An iPhone. Need more?	2017-01-06	it	Many have written before me, so I will not repeat the usual things, especially as it is the 3rd iPhone I buy on Amazon in 4 years. For those few who still do not know: 1) the color refers to the back of the phone: in front is white; 2) 100% product for the Italian market; 3) the actual memory is around 112 GB, 4) this lightning adapter, not the wireless headphones (sold separately), but the ear pods, 5) my it was already loaded in the box and updated to iOS 10.3. Pay attention if you need to make a backup from a device updated to 10.2: you will have to go back to the new one from 10.3 to 10.2, transfer the backup and then update to 10.3.
5168	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Carlos Alberto E. Tavares	4	Very good	2017-03-18	it	Very good, beautiful color a little bigger than most, the room is excellente. Ricomendable protection for shock or fall
5169	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	dorsigennaro	5	100% satisfied 100	2017-03-17	it	I wanted to congratulate the neophonia shop for the seriousness and quality in following the customer, buying the iPhone 7 smartphone 4G 128 GB, I was a bit skeptical about buying this product with a discount of almost 150 euros compared to the various shopping malls, instead everything arrived with precision both the color and all the other product working perfectly even delivered with 2 days in advance, we thank amazon and NEOPHONIA.
5170	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	4	Great, super amazon, but too expensive	2017-06-09	it	Always great. Some applications are no longer a certainty in optimization. The battery, considered amperage, is wonderful. The result of excellent software. However, I consider it too expensive. 500 euros would be more than enough. Now 200 euro phones can do the same things, but they are certainly less safe in navigation and for any viruses
5171	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	elvy	5	At the height	2019-01-10	it	My first Iphone that did not make me at all regret a smartphone from the Samsung range. Easy to use for those who are familiar with the technology, very useful for many features inside the basic ios apps, such as the ability to scan documents (in the Notes app). It's a mini-computer in effect, I wouldn't exchange it with other Android.
5172	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Lorenzo	5	I will always buy online!	2017-04-01	it	I took these Iphone even if a little hesitant. I really have to think again! The shipment was only two working days! And the phone is perfect! Exactly the same that you would find in any store, only with a substantial difference of almost 200 euros! I will definitely buy again online!
5173	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	4	Files 7	2017-01-05	it	Excellent supplier chosen by Amazon, very fast in shipping, the product arrived earlier than expected. I asked for the invoice and it was included in the package punctually. I do not agree with the apple policy that decided to remove the jack to insert the earphone, in this way you can not have a headset and at the same time recharge the phone, obviously this choice was made to entice the 'purchase of the blothoot earphones. Overall good but not great.
5174	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	clacuomo	4	Cheap	2018-12-05	it	Ok
5175	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Raf	5	Amazing smartphone!	2017-05-27	it	After having had an iPhone 5 series for years, I switched to this product and I must say that the leap in quality is abysmal and the improvement is enormous. I will not dwell on the technical characteristics of the product, nor on the content of the package or on the construction materials; thousands of other reviews and web pages talk about this. What I want to focus on, however, is my experience of use. I want to talk about what I feel, using this phone, and the feelings I have in everyday use. I have been using this phone for months and I must say that I have never had any problems whatsoever. The product is very reliable and I know that at any moment I will be able to take advantage of it without any hitch. In web browsing there are no lag or slowdowns, the opening of the app is very fast and even the gaming experience is unmatched. The quality of the images is great , thanks to a well optimized hardware and to a display with bright and vivid colors. Surely there are not those innovations and those technological widespread on the android products, like for example the frontal notification led, but this lack is not felt at all. overall quality of the product is unmatched and, even when it is grasped, one becomes aware of this. The metal body, the construction materials, the quality of the assembly make you feel the full weight of an obsessive attention to even the smallest detail. Software updates provided directly by the manufacturer, guaranteeing long product life, are not lacking. Certainly the price is high, but in my opinion it should be considered as an investment. If you spend so much to buy this product, you will have a phone that will have top performance for a long time and that will not quickly depreciate, as happens too often with android products. Definitely yes, I recommend it to those who are already in the Apple world or want to enter this world. With this product you will experience the best of this brand and you will fully understand its greatness. If my information was useful to you, let me know.
5176	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	paola	5	I phone 7	2017-07-04	it	I bought the phone7 for a gift, the phone arrived well sealed and brand new, I wrote email to the seller Bacom for invoice and he promptly replied by sending me the invoice the next day and telling me that Apple answers the first year and the second Bacom. The person to whom I gave it has found that the battery is discharged in half a day, he tried to do the iOS update as advised by Apple, I wrote to the seller and he responded promptly and egregiously to try for a few days and eventually contact them again. I was very hesitant about buying online, but for now I am completely satisfied with the assistance I received. Now we hope to solve the battery problem. Update: the phone had problems and was quickly replaced by Bacom. Five stars !
5177	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Giovanni	5	great phone	2017-10-24	it	Inside the box we know the new chuffie with the adapter. The display is 4.7 with 32 GB of memory, with the ios 10 operating system updateable to iOS 11.03.

5180	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Lorenzo Musso	5	IPhone 7 at office1one seller	2017-04-27	it	I had an iPhone 5S for 3 years and I never had any problems until he stopped reading my SIM and repairing it would have cost me more than taking a new one. iPhone 7 is very similar to my old 5S in terms of functions but as a design there is no comparison, the iPhone is much more appealing. I was very satisfied with the seller who, despite not being able to provide me with the tracking of the order, kept me updated by e-mail about the arrival and the fact that he would arrive 2 days late due to the bridge on 25 April. a 10 on the phone and a 9 to the office1one seller.
5181	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Marta Iannucci	1	Defective product	2017-05-01	it	Exceptional shipping, ordered on April 27th and arrived on April 28th, too bad it was a defective product (non-working microphone, also recognized by Apple, which made a replacement)
5182	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	fabrizio	1	Crook, not very honest	2017-10-13	it	Write Italy but in reality it is a guarantee for Europe. In addition, the phone came with a folded box. I do not recommend. Around there are lower prices with Europe guarantee.

5191	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Jessica	4	battery	2018-10-07	it	beautiful phone, personally I love apple and at home I have practically everything of this brand, the only problem is the battery, after months of use, does not remain sufficiently charged. otherwise the phone is fluid, it doesn't crash, it doesn't take viruses.
5192	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	artemio	1	apple	2019-01-10	it	Price too high for a smart with very low performance .... in full apple style

5194	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Salvatore D. Reviews	5	What are we talking about?	2017-06-08	it	Needless to present this space phone, what can I tell you? iPhone 7 today even with the release of galaxy s8, remains a gem! the desire of all those who love ios, apple and the user friendly experience! because it is what we are talking about, a device capable of adapting to the hands of the less experienced like few. The search for apple for the user experience is something that goes far beyond any other company and I tell you from one who knows a lot about ios and development for the aforementioned fact. if you want a phone that makes you feel like it's done for you, then iphone is the right choice
5195	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Angela	5	It doesn't have the Jack x the headphones but they come out with the adapter, thanks	2018-11-10	it	Perfect in everything
5196	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	1	still no phone trace	2017-05-15	it	Iphone ordered the 6, sent according to the seller on 8 but we are at 15 and still I have not received anything ... and it is a gift ... I tried to contact the seller several times but he doesn't answer and also through amazon I solicited to have at least a traking number ... I will wait until tomorrow and then I will start the refund procedure ... absolutely unreliable.
5197	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Marco T.	5	Awesome	2016-12-04	it	Product of 10 and praise, what else to say: it beats every other phone. Personally, I chose the 128 GB model to fully enjoy the phone without having to worry about space, and after a month I think I made the right choice.
5198	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	5	Excellent	2017-07-18	it	I bought the iPhone 7 a few days ago and I have only positive comments. The phone is new and arrived in excellent condition and with all the associated accessories. Fast delivery
5199	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Anna M.	5	Perfect	2019-01-05	it	Excellent product, reliable seller. Arrived new, fantastic
5200	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	scrittore	3	where the hell can you find a booklet or a file with instructions for use?	2018-04-03	it	a mole of no small importance, no instructions for use either in Italian or in English. those approaching a smartphone for the first time remain a mysterious object. mine shows the display only horizontally and does not move from there. I am forced to return to the technician who set it up. it will be nonsense but with an instruction book I could do it myself. perhaps a downloadable manual exists, but it is a word to find it on the list of sites some of which are suspicious, could I have a suggestion, please?
5201	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Vittorio Ruotolo TVG	4	Iphone gives 4 Stelle	2017-07-09	it	it's a great phone with dual cameras and I also like the fact that it doesn't have a headphone jack
5202	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Carlo Drago	4	immediate	2019-04-29	it	always better apple
5203	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Schmid Christian	5	Great	2018-12-14	it	Great everything went well
5204	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Ivano	4	Right product, but no invoice .... (only receipt)	2016-12-30	it	The product and the packaging are perfect, so I gave 4 stars; I have not given 5 because the invoice request I found no little resistance from the seller: at first I was told that it was already in the package, but instead it was the receipt (among other things without a receipt and then the guarantee?!), then to my explicit request (I am a freelancer and I need the bill up until tax) I was told that by now it was no longer possible because they had made the receipt ... mah ?? !!
5205	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Danix984 on YouTube	5	great	2017-02-16	it	Inside the package there are the earphones, the charger, the usb / lightning cable and the adapter for the audio jack, on the phone in fact there is no longer the classic round hole where to insert the earphones, but now we only use the brings lightning for everything. On the hardware and software performance of the phone, nothing to say, apple is now at the forefront. Luminous screen with a very high definition 1334x750 pixel at 326ppi, 4.7 inch hd retina display. The 7plus version has a 5.5 display with 1920x1080 pixels at 401 ppi. IP67 certified against dust, splashes and water. The processor is an A10 Fusion chip with a 64-bit architecture plus an integrated M10 motion coprocessor. 12MP camera, aperture ƒ / 1.8 aperture, digital zoom up to 5x. The 7plus version has 12MP cameras with wide-angle and telephoto, wide-angle diaphragm: f / 1.8 and telephoto: 2.8 / 2.8, plus 2x optical zoom; up to 10x digital zoom. On both models there is optical image stabilization, quad-LED True Tone flash, sapphire crystal lens coating, autofocus with Focus Pixels, face and body detection, automatic HDR for photos, sequential shooting mode , self-timer and photo geotagging. For videos we have 4K recording at 30 fps, HD recording (1080p) at 30 fps or 60 fps, HD recording (720p) at 30 fps, optical video image stabilization, quad-LED True Tone flash, slow-motion (1080p at 120 fps; 720p at 240 fps), Time-lapse with stabilization, continuous autofocus, face and body detection, ability to take 8MP photos while shooting in 4K, zoom during video playback and video geotagging. The central physical key is always missing, now the new Home key, like on the 6s, always has the integrated fingerprint sensor but it is soft touch, that is nn crushes but only leans the finger, with the possibility of setting the sensitivity '. The volume buttons and the lock / unlock button remain, in addition to the levers for the silent mode. Autonomy up to 14 hours in conversation (2 more than 6s) and up to 10 days in standby, up to 12 hours in LTE and 14 in WI-FI, up to 13 hours of video playback and 40 hours of audio playback . we also find barometer, 3-axis gyroscope, accelerometer, proximity sensor and ambient light sensor. Comparing it with the previous model, the dimensions are the same even though the weight is slightly lower, faster processors, IP67 certification, camera with the same resolution but we have a smaller aperture, image stabilization, detection as well as also faces of the bodies and finally the quad-LED true tone flash, Idem for the video camera.
5206	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	stefano c.	4	we were expecting this from apple, but ...	2017-05-29	it	The sales package is slightly different from the usual. Inside a 1A charger output, a USB / Lightning cable, an EarPods headset with Lightning connector and an adapter to use headphones with 3.5mm audio jack. The design is very similar to that of the iPhone 6 except for the earpiece , larger to also accommodate the second system speaker. The camera is slightly shifted to the left and is now 7 megapixel with stabilization. The side keys are a bit less recessed in the body and the SIM drawer has a small gasket to protect it from water and dust. The aesthetic differences are more noticeable on the lower part where the 3.5mm audio jack disappears to make room for a mostly aesthetic grid where the main microphone is positioned. The main speaker and the Lightning door remain in place. Aesthetic innovations also on the back. The separation bands of the antennas have been partially eliminated and the camera has a softer design, protected by a part of the body. It also improves the flash which is now a Dual Tone with 4 LEDs. IPhone 7 is water and dust resistant with IP67 certification even if damage from liquids is not covered by warranty. To offer better resistance, Apple has also redesigned the home button, which is now no longer clickable as usual but is able to recognize finger pressure by offering tactile feedback that we can customize by choosing between three different intensity levels. The button is capacitive and cannot be clicked with objects or if we wear traditional gloves.
5207	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Cliente Amazon	3	THAT ANXIETY ...	2017-01-06	it	The product is o.k. while the expedition did not return within the established time, creating me a certain anxiety, given the amount spent and the need to receive it in time to make a gift.
5208	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	FLYDAN	5	Excellent purchase	2017-09-17	it	Arrived on time on the delivery, unopened package, all as I expected, I still have to try the supplied headphones, for now with the mobile I am fine (very similar to the iPhone 5 I had) I Devon anchors accustomed to the touch button
5209	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	DavideG	5	Absolutely to buy!	2017-08-13	it	Bought in the sidereal gray color and I must say that it is really beautiful in every part. Superb from a visual point of view, it immediately strikes the eye, both from a technical point of view and from the point of view of use. I think it is one of the best smartphones on the market, I highly recommend the purchase.
5210	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Dpg88	5	Great smartphone	2017-03-20	it	I state that I didn't buy this smartphone on Amazon, but I wanted to expose my opinion on this new iPhone 7. I have always owned an Android smartphone and I had to get used to the new iOS system. I really liked the new iPhone 7, it's easy to use, very fluid and intuitive. I wanted to buy the iPhone 6s but then I bought the iPhone 7 because it doesn't have the bars on the back like the 6 / 6s that I honestly didn't like, and then because compared to 6 / 6s it has a bit bigger battery, finally a 4-core processor (2 high-efficiency main and 2 for energy saving), finally a 2gb RAM, stereo speakers and finally waterproof. Thanks to its size it is quite comfortable to use with one hand. In conclusion, a great smartphone
5211	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Pegasus	3	ok	2017-06-29	it	what should I say about this phone!?!?!? SW and HW back 5/7 years compared to all other brands of smartphonea part the home button, the jack and the color is identical to the 6s, as usual they make phones every year identical but the chickens that buy them are always there, including myself. I changed it only for the color because black with gray edges made me really disgusting. the only nice thing about ios is that when I restore everything back exactly like the old phone, any option! so I buy it for that and go ahead of ios even though I always find myself with an old born phone
5212	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Cliente Amazon	5	Great	2017-06-05	it	I previously had an IPhone 5s ... the 7 with more features is more than perfect ... the photography is greatly improved. Also the price compared to the purchase in the store, excellent.
5213	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	salvatore zona	1	purchase iPhone 7 not working immediately, not even for initialization	2016-11-25	it	I had a phone that did not work right away and with the right of termination as by law I am still fighting to have it withdrawn and have the amount refunded and I know I will have to pass the case to the lawyer.
5214	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Alessandro Gallotti	4	I had to change my mind (for the better)	2017-04-30	it	Always a fan of Android products and not attracted by the philosophy of the apple, for a few days now I find myself holding a corporate iPhone7 in place of my deceased BB. I thought the worst, but the phone is fantastic. First of all: the virtual keyboard is light years better than that of Android. The accuracy is comparable to that of the physical keyboard of the BB.Display beautiful and "" deep "despite a lower resolution on the paper than the competition. Good audio, contact management and OK. Other impressive side, the speed of navigation in 4g (operator Vodafone). Opening a web page or downloading an app is a matter of tenths of a second. In: the price (I doubt I will spend that amount from private) and battery life, not better than other phones that don't spend the day with intense use.
5215	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Daniela	5	Excellent as always, is the upgrade worth?	2016-09-28	it	FIRST IMPRESSIONS The box, as usual Apple is quite minimal. Inside we find: the headphones with lightning connector, the Lightning-Jack 3.5 adapter and the usual power supply. DESIGN Frontally we notice the home button that is no longer physical but virtual, in fact inside there is a "motor" that returns the feed of the vibration that can be set at 3 levels, at the beginning it left me a bit perplexed but I got used to it quickly and now I prefer it even to the mechanical one. Below we have the speakers and the microphone, for the rest it is like the previous devices. The phone is very compact and light, in fact it immediately gives a feeling of excellent weight balance between the internal components; I bought the matte black color and the touch and feel is beautiful, it looks like a small perfectly polished stone. I appreciated that the camera was made "to re-enter" slightly giving a more tapered appearance to the device and that Apple has finally given waterproofing with IP67 certification. SCREEN 750x1334, IPS, 4.7 "Perfect display, the colors are excellent as in all IPS and the blacks are the typical ones of the Amoled, absolute, moreover the viewing angle is perfect and the screen can be seen in any light condition. on resolution, in my opinion a few more pixels could fit, although I believe that the decision to reduce the resolution was made to optimize the battery as much as possible. CAMERA The 12MP camera is excellent: the tip is instantaneous and the various shooting modes are very interesting (overview, etc ...).The photos are very well, in fact those little problems that the 6 had with the photos in the dark have been solved, about the environments with so much light there is no need to say anything, they are photographs to show. The videos are excellent thanks also to the 'introduction of optical stabilization, you can record in 4K at 30fps or 1080 at 60fps (which I prefer), slow motion and time-lapse are great .. AUTONOMY In my opinion Apple has managed to solve that Achilles heel that has always marked all iPhones, the battery. In fact, despite the phone being very light the battery optimization is excellent, in fact I managed to completely overcome the stress day with only the 1950mAh of the device. Given the low capacity of the battery (although the phone can manage it very well) I recommend using low voltage power supplies to make it last as long as possible, in my opinion the quick refills in the long run ruin it. USE EXPERIENCE & CONCLUSIONS The new iOS 10.0.1 operating system is excellent, in fact a global search has been introduced that works very well and the 3D-Touch has been integrated with almost all the applications, moreover the maps that are now improved they work excellently. Under the telephone point of view the telephone behaves well, in fact the reception is in line with the 6s although the radio antennas have been moved to give a better weight balance to the device. As for the speakerphone, I really appreciated that Apple has made the earpiece a stereo speaker along with the main one, this guarantees excellent call quality even in hands-free mode that works great even in the car at high speeds, overall I feel good and feel good they feel good. The phone runs well, in fact the 2GB of RAM Apple and the new A10 Fusion processor guarantee excellent daily usability: both social networks and Safari behave very well; however there are some microlag during the animations but I think it is absolutely normal and I can guarantee that they are absolutely negligible. In conclusion I can say that this iPhone does not differ much from its predecessor, perhaps the upgrade rationally does not suit even if honestly those small aspects in which Apple has put their hands have become the new points of excellence of the phone.

5219	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Marco	3	Nice but inefficient I expected better	2017-02-05	it	The phone is very nice but it didn't satisfy me at all. I state that I had a 6s and I found myself very well the only flaw the battery is from there I chose to switch to a 6s plus with this terminal I had a great time also because the battery lasted two days. When iPhone 7 came out I just fell in love and the I bought immediately even though many said that the difference from 6s to 7 was non-existent I was very skeptical because I was convinced that those small flaws of 6s were overcome to the great.And instead the battery of the iPhone 7 leaves much to be desired also the connection to the internet I find lower because on 6s I never had the E at my house while on 7 it is a real conviction (I was Wind and I remained Wind). However the phone often crashes is not very fast. ANOTHER THING THAT I WAS NOT EXPECTED BY APPLE The iPhone 6s has an excellent tuchid but after the iOS 10 update it is slowed down as there is a strange bug that happens at least 7 times out of 10. I hope I have been helpful

5222	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cubik Customer	5	WHAT TO SAY ....... EXCELLENT	2018-04-19	it	Purchased used in "" excellent "" condition. Price of water slightly below the lowest price found on the net, € 491 (used Amazon) against € 499 (new). The phone arrived in one day as a great Amazon service and was in really perfect condition, apart from the slightly ruined box. But the Amazon warranty has no equal, two years of absolute tranquility that ....... DO NOT HAVE PRICE !!!!!!!!
5223	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	gaspare	5	There is little to say, just the word Apple!	2018-11-30	it	I took it to give it to my wife. Generally we never take the latest version of the iPhone because the prices seem immoral. After some time we update. I must say that from 5C to 7 it is a nice step forward. He arrived, in fact I went to pick him up in the post at Tarcento because the postman didn't find my home (I get hundreds of packages a year !!), so I still don't know how to evaluate the object well, but my wife seems happy, so it will probably be my next purchase.
5224	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Alessandro AA	4	As described, fully functional	2018-10-08	it	I purchased a used black iphone 7 32gb and sold as grade B. I confirm that everything works properly, from the display, to the fingerprint reader, to the vibration at the speakers. The phone is functionally perfect. Being grade B (but already specified in the sale) it was marked on the back, and a slight line on the top display on the right where there is however the black frame (it can be seen against the light and cmq in the use of the device does not disturb because it is in the glass part where the display is never lit). The battery is 85% efficient. I would say that for the price it is for the 12 months guarantee cmq, the price is congruous to the offer. Terminal arrived 4 days earlier than expected via UPS. (Second-hand mobile seller).
5225	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	friendlycomet05	1	We are not bad	2019-01-12	it	Just arrived the phone seemed to work until I tried to make a call. The problem was the earpiece which had a very low volume (although I had turned up the volume to the maximum) and also it didn't work in stereo mode for videos (something that distinguishes the iPhone 7 from an iPhone 6s). Request a refund.
5226	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Matteo D'Antuono	5	Apple iPhone 7	2019-04-23	it	Purchased for my uncle who came from an iPhone 4s and was very happy with the transition: besides the fact that the migration from old to new device is very easy, I preferred to let him take another iPhone mainly because he used to use this iOS system. If I had taken an Android from it, the migration would have been a bit traumatic, above all because it is a person over 60. New, packaged and original product, complete with power supply and earphones. Very satisfied

5229	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Mauro	4	It works well but too limited compared to Android. Great photos.	2018-11-04	it	Product arrived in perfect condition. It's an iphone, for better or for worse: it does few things but very well. I purchased it for its size that was not too large compared to current smartphones. With ios 11 it still works well, but as with all my previous apple products in the short run it will make me slow. Excellent camera but system too closed and limited.

5236	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Alessio	5	Excellent purchase	2018-10-04	it	The smartphone arrived a day ahead of schedule perfectly packed. The apple package was sealed with the related films. The first days of use show a snappy iphone that consumes little battery power.

5247	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Leonardo	5	To date, still the best quality price product from Apple	2018-01-14	it	Purchased some time ago for the competitive price, I later preferred a more opaque black version. I will not dwell on the product on which you will find thousands of reviews on the net: I believe that today at Apple is the best in terms of function / quality /price. I have been using iPhones since the beginning and I am satisfied with the reliability and usability of these products, without wanting to take any fanboy positions.
5248	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Paolo	4	First Apple experience	2017-12-07	it	In July I decided to buy my first Apple phone, save at least € 100 on the price of the same in physical stores. I must say that I consider myself very satisfied with the experience of use, it is a beautiful phone to look at, to use with many features and applications available . The only flaw, I have the version with a back in matt black aluminum, and after just a few months it showed dots due to the loss of the black color of the aluminum!
5249	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Emanuele C.	5	Beautiful product, fast troubleshooting	2017-10-22	it	In this case the stars go not only to the product, which remains one of Apple's spearheads even after the release of the iPhone 8, but also in service. There was a delay in delivery, but thanks to the Amazon features I was able to contact the seller, clarify the problem and find an agreement on the review of delivery times. Without being too anxious for an article that seemed to be lost! Brava Apple, good Amazon and good Digitech in managing the relationship with the customer.
5250	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	kisso	5	Very beautifull!!	2017-07-04	it	Well, it's not for me because I'm an andriod employee ... but the person to whom I bought it was so great and satisfied, that it allowed me to write a very positive review !! Obviously the brand says it all , the same quality, what to say, you know it better than me ... so it's a great buy and the highest quality !!
5251	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Mario	5	good seller	2017-08-17	it	the phone looks as expected, produced by Apple then a quality smartphone, however it is a phone where you pay more for the brand than the quality of the smartphone in itself, a samsung s8 excels much more regarding the quality of the screen and photographs. however for those who are avid apple is recommended as always.
5252	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Walter	4	Great product! A single flaw ....	2018-07-26	it	Then the product is great as we all already know, only one flaw that made me a little expire the seller .. nothing that anyway I gave 4 stars, but this iPhone 7 has a slight defect of speaker which is given by an update .I bought it for a customer who trusted my professional skill .. when you told me about this defect I immediately contacted the seller to take advantage of the warranty and I didn't like the answer very much. Answer by seller (the product is covered by Apple's official warranty, take it to an Apple store). Thanks ok, I solved it this way because one is 5 km away but not everyone has an Apple store 2 steps to take it is fix it in about an hour. 4 stars because it deserves them

5255	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Stefano	5	Great	2017-01-26	it	It seems to me useless to review the product, we know well that it is safe with Apple (and we will miss it with what it costs). So it remains for me to say that the product arrived on schedule, well packaged, and without nasty surprises. I've been using it for a month now, and I haven't found any problems. Congratulations
5256	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	5	Great	2017-08-31	it	The phone was not for me, but I opened the package and saw it running. First he arrived early in just two days. The packaging was perfect. Inside a bigger box there was the typical Apple incelofanata package, with obviously inside the cell and all the accessories. The new cell phone works perfectly (up to now, one day after receipt). Ps. Digital Kingdom Dealer
5257	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Alberto B.	2	Unfortunately, it had ignition problems	2018-03-29	it	Unfortunately, despite the phone arrived on time and in excellent condition, including original packaging, after 3 days of use it had problems with the ignition, so that I had to bring it to fix. My low rating is due to this experience which I hope for the seller and for other users is an isolated fact
5258	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	5	Definitely recommend!	2017-09-07	it	I was a bit hesitant to buy because my mother was just a victim of an online scam just when she bought an iphone (not on amazon) but what can I say? The phone is perfect, arrived packed and also protected by a cardboard overpack. The Globalphone seller proved to be more than sure: excellent price and the iPhone even arrived a day early on schedule and anticipated by text message the day before that warned me of the sudden arrival of the package
5259	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Dreaming Production	5	Always fantastic	2017-10-27	it	Truly exceptional, it is true we all want to save but my dear, unfortunately the quality is paid, not for fraud at times but precisely because the products have a value, as in this case an apple iphone7 resistant to water, shock, excellent for every circumstance. I recommend it more to the professionals than me.
5260	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Cliente Amazon	3	Telephone ok, so-so company	2017-08-30	it	The phone arrived in no time and in the original Apple package. Now I have had it for a couple of months and it is working quite well, the only thing is that it overheats every now and then while I use it and I can't understand if it's a normal thing about the iPhone7 or if it's a problem with this phone in particular. I am rather unhappy with the company: I had to write over and over again before I received the receipt, and when I wrote asking what to do about the overheating problem, my question was almost ignored. In the same way I am struggling to get a precise answer on how to return during the warranty: when I asked how the additional guarantee of them works (at the time of purchase I was assured that there is a one year Apple warranty and a year with their company) they only told me to send them the phone, completely ignoring my repeated questions about the address and the procedures to follow in those cases. Is there perhaps little transparency? In any case, the phone works quite well, for now it only got me down once and I hope it's normal and not due to the model. Ave where we have only been for a couple of months.
5261	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	DiegoMDV	5	Ottimo..com bought by the Regno Digitale seller	2017-07-18	it	The iPhone does not need further reviews.

Remarkable the camera, which despite not having high megapixels guarantees always photos at the top !!! I would not go back to Android
5263	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Mahshid	5	Great cell phone, we recommend 128GB	2017-08-24	it	The phone is great, much better than what I thought and seen on the photos, the 128 memory really recommended, I have no space problem. The seller was quite helpful and courteous, only after a day when I ordered the phone I received a message before the date scheduled for shipment by the courier (DHL) saying to stay at home because the product will arrive until the end of the day and I had to stay at home all day and no product arrived that day, but instead arrived on the last day, obviously it was not the seller's fault. However very satisfied with my online purchase, Amazon always good. Thanks

5266	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Alex	5	Beautiful iPhone 7	2016-11-15	it	The phone arrived earlier than expected, it was in the original package with nylon on it, with the IMEI check it appears that the September warranty is already active but that's ok. The gift was a great one. The convenience of buying on Amazon and that was a better price, plus the availability of color and 128 GB memory capacity. For rest it works fine.
5267	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Alfredo Sole	5	COUNCIL	2018-01-10	it	I took this phone in January 2017, paid 689 (?) Compared to Apple's 900. Until now I have not had any problem with the battery or extra operation. If I remember correctly, shipping was faster than expected.

5278	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Marino de Falco	5	Great!	2017-08-30	it	After having an iPhone 4, then a 5s, it was time to change it, it gave various problems. So I took the 7 even if a 7s or even 8 is about to be released. I preferred to save quite a bit by taking the 7, choosing the European warranty and the 32 Gb. For bad that goes I can buy the Apple Care and have the extended guarantee. I preferred the 32 Gb instead of the 128 Gb because I don't use the cell phone for the music and I use it very little for the photos, I have a good reflex for this. In doing so, I saved the 100 euro difference between the two models. I chose to have further savings by taking the Matt Black, the 5s I had was similar, Grigio Siderale. Nothing more to say about the quality of the product, it will be surpassed only by the next upcoming model. In short I think I made a good purchase by paying it 580 euros, shipping included. Great seller Digital Kingdom.
5279	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Law&Order	5	Seller GLOBALPHONE Srls OK	2017-08-18	it	I don't really believe in reviews on Amazon related to the top of the range smartphones, since there are specific blogs where competent technicians illustrate vices and virtues of the latest discoveries (vice versa, it seems more appropriate to review on little-known amz devices, of which there are no it is a trace on the web). On the iPhone 7 everything has been said and written: rather, I would like to point out that the choice of the seller from which to buy the smartphone is essential. In fact, these products are never sold by Amazon, but from external stores that rely on venders here. Very often the evaluation of the user is invalidated by the behavior of the seller, which has nothing to do with the characteristics of the product. This confirms that selecting the seller here is much more important than evaluating the product itself, since the latter knows it all. Having said that, in my case GLOBALPHONE Srls proved to be fast, cheap (610 €) and impeccable. Do not therefore have doubts about this store. For all others, rely on specific seller reviews (NOT on the product) evaluating and comparing other users' buying experiences like us. Good shopping!
5280	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	gerardo	5	great	2016-12-15	it	I have the second one I buy and I am satisfied with it, they work well, I am in Italian, no defect and in addition you save, you want more
5281	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Pasquale	4	Excellent but audio jack and waterproof	2018-03-17	it	iPhone 7 great product: 1-starting from the price we say that a reasonable price, 2- the product boasts of an excellent quality as regards the materials well defined on the minimum details, 3- excellent product as battery life, unlike the old iPhone I have noticed a clear difference for the battery life, 4- as for the camera, the spectacular internal one (as always) extreme very very good but not like other top of the range, 5-excellent all phone sensors and all features, even with regards to the applications, they run very well, having excellent speed. more audio; 7- a bad thing about the jack output because even if everyone thinks it's a stupid, well, no, the jack was very useful on everything, because already on the listener a lot of music even if the Bluetooth output is excellent but the cable quality is a bomb; 8-impermeability is another mystery I have never experienced this aspect because I would like to avoid damage also because I did not understand Apple what it actually did on this phone, but I can say that the water falling on it seems to have suffered no damage;
5282	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Cityhunter	1	returned	2017-08-03	it	Item returned as it presented dust between the camera sensor and the light green of protection ... from an ip67 certified phone (resistant to water and dust) it was not the case to keep it. Impeccable Amazon after-sales service and repayment in a very short time
5283	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Matteo	5	Iphone 7	2016-12-20	it	A product that has kept faith with expectations, it is extremely elegant and fine, as far as the technical specifications are concerned, it seems to me pointless to indicate them here when they are present everywhere. Excellent and fluid in use, externally delicate, I recommend buying immediately covers and films to avoid unpleasant incidents.
5284	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Guendalina	5	Super!!	2016-11-08	it	Mobile that speaks for itself, (and there are thousands of reviews on the internet). Aesthetically the same as its predecessor iphone 6 / 6s and at software level it does not differ much from the previous one (so the upgrade does not recommend it). Bought and shipped directly from Amazon which is synonymous with guarantee, the mobile phone has arrived sealed like all its accessories. Italian box. Italian Warranty.
5285	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Marcello	5	Reliable, intuitive, responsive, the best iPhone ever!	2016-12-10	it	5 stars deserved, Apple as always amazes with its products. Let's analyze this magnificent product step by step. The competition offers better hardware at half the price, yes, it's true. So why pay for a phone with half the GB of RAM compared to any Android phone? I answer that iPhone has the operating system that makes the difference. So yes, spend more on a phone with a good, stable, working and intuitive operating system, it's worth it. No matter how much RAM they add in each new device with Android, because the free memory will always be small, it would be used already when the phone is switched on to load useless apps that most of the time you will never use (and that are not removable ), make the system heavier. IOS is extremely light and 2 GB of RAM guarantee perfect operation and fluidity, furthermore the system apps that you are not interested in can be eliminated. IOS is an operating system designed to work directly on its hardware, for better optimization and consumption savings. energetic, unlike Android which is very generic to be adapted in different phones among the various brands. In fact, even though it has a standard battery that may seem small and outdated (around 1970 mAh), the operating system optimized exclusively for its CPU (with extremely low power but at the same time powerful), guarantees a good battery life. With prolonged use it is possible to face the whole day, in my case that I am not an avid geek, I managed to make a maximum of 48 hours between one charge and another with average use (receiving / making phone calls / video calls, messages whatsapp and listen to music). iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rank first in the benchmark ranking for their videogaming performance. In November 2016 it appears to have the best most powerful processor in the telephony market. It has 2 stereo speakers, the sound is of excellent quality (not at earphones levels, but excellent for being tiny speakers) and they sound extremely loud, no phone holds the comparison with its speakers, not even its predecessor 6s.The sound transfers better if it is placed on the table, the music will be deeper and more powerful. The supplied earphones are also excellent, the sound is clean and even the bass tones are excellent. There is a remote control with microphone, with volume keys at the ends and a multifunctional control unit (to change music, answer the phone or reject the call). Furthermore, the remote control can also be used to take pictures (by pressing the + button or - when using the camera app). The Home button is no longer mechanical because in the old series it broke easily with use, it was replaced with one that in reality is not possible to press, to the touch a motor is activated that vibrating simulates the pressure of the old button, it may seem strange in the beginning but you get used to it soon, theoretically its life should last longer. The camera takes incredibly sharp pictures, so far I have not taken a photo out of focus (even in extreme low light conditions, thanks to the wide aperture that captures more light and the optical image stabilizer that does a really good job, avoiding the blurred photos. Small negative notes, how much the phone costs I would have expected a screen with higher resolution (personally I don't care about a screen with very high resolutions, with the naked eye you don't see the pixels, but a possible future purchase of VR glasses is to be excluded on this HD screen), a memory expansion slot and a faster focus. Attention is not slow to the point of being alarming, but for example the Samsung s7 focuses faster and costs less as well. According to many, the lack of the 3.5 mm jack penalizes the phone, but honestly I do not miss it because of the use I make of it, I do not happen to charge the phone and use the earphones, if one day I had to feel the need, with a few euros you can buy a lightnin door splitter. Given the negative notes, for me it remains a valid smartphone and I reiterate that to make the real differences is the operating system, after all I think what a buyer looks for , deep down, it's just the reliability of his mobile phone. After almost a month from the purchase I can only feel satisfied with the purchase, never a crash of the app, sudden phone reset or various anomalies. Who should I recommend? Surely not to those who have an iPhone 6s, there are differences but the game is not worth the candle. E 'can recommend it to those who have an iPhone too old or those like me, got tired of using both Android and Windows Phone and finally decided to try IOS.

5302	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Antonella Alberti	5	The joy of a teenager	2017-02-06	it	Obviously for a lot of teenagers this cell phone is a status symbol and there is nothing better. Well I can only say that the seller offered me the chance to save a few euros and, given the cost of the device, this is not at all bad, moreover, it was very punctual and on January 30 the courier delivered the package. I have to object to the courier - in fact I actually did it immediately by calling Bartolini - you can't leave a package of this value in anyone's hands (in this case a neighbor who left it at the door without even ringing !) just for the laziness of ringing a bell and delivering it to the person concerned, he was already doing another delivery! If the package was lost, who would have repaid the product ???? However my son is satisfied and it is a week that he can no longer fiddle ... with my highest disappointment ;-)
5303	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Andrea	5	Excellent Product	2017-04-13	it	Excellent product sold and shipped by Amazon. I was wary of buying an iPhone on Amazon but then I convinced myself and bought it and what to say .. perfect! everything went well but please .. make sure the product is sold and shipped from Amazon for added security!
5304	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Guide & Recensioni	5	The future is already here	2017-01-22	it	Finally our review arrives on the iPhone 7, the first Apple smartphone without audio jack and with the renewed home button, where the design remains the same but iOS 10 is the real beating heart! An important turning point was expected with regard to the design of the new iPhone 7, presented along with the older brother iPhone 7 Plus, during the Keynote of 7/09/2017, but if it were not for the jet black coloring (available only for memory cuts above 32GB) we found ourselves an aesthetically pleasing product equal to its predecessor iPhone 6 / 6s, without audio jack but with a renewed home button and a dual rear camera that we will analyze in the review of the iPhone 7 Plus. These are the main innovations introduced in the iPhone 7 which differs from the 7 Plus just for the absence of the dual rear camera and of the 4.7 ″ Unboxing iPhone 7 retina display HD As any self-respecting product we start by discovering what is hidden inside the packaging of purchase in classic Apple style: Apple iPhone 7 Lightning recharging compartment Headphones with lightning cable 3,5 ″ Audio / Lightning adapter Jack 1Ah wall charger We have seen therefore how the Cupertino company has decided to supply a pair of EarPods headphones with lightning connector as well as a Jack 3.5 adapter to take advantage of accessories and earphones from other brands, headphones not to be confused with the brand new and innovative AirPods, similar to the Samsung Gear Icon X regarding the concept but different in design.But then how will we listen to music? The absence of the audio jack has made many people turn up their nose, but the answer to the above question is very simple. We will have to equip ourselves with Bluetooth devices and since these are now widespread and used for a while, I do not see what the problem is. Thus the audio jack disappears, which apart from personal tastes and opinions actually leaves no room for anything since the grid on the left is purely aesthetic, while the speaker on the right side of the lightning connector provides high audio quality, with balanced highs and deep and full bodied.Remaining in the field of audio, we cannot praise the choice of Apple engineers who have seen fit to integrate an additional stereo speaker under the front camera capable of providing an even more balanced sound even if according to some sources it is only an optimization of the ear capsule. Photos and Selfies even in low light conditionsA good news for selfie lovers comes with this iPhone 7 as they can take pictures even in dark places thanks to the 4.7 ″ display which, when illuminated, turns into a practical and excellent flash retina capable of illuminating foreground the subjects in the foreground that will then be captured in HD resolution thanks to the 7 Megapixel lens. iPhone 6s optics with six elements. Equipped with f / 1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization to shoot videos in 4K, together with the 12 megapixel sensor, it guarantees brighter photos in low ambient light conditions, a feature also favored by the True Tone Flash consisting of 4 iPhone 7 is resistant to water splashes ... But beware of the warrantyOn both new iPhones the IP67 certification is present, so ours is a smartphone resistant to water, dust and sand, even if after spending 800 euros a bit of fear there is always, but at least we can make videos, take pictures or call even in the rain without thoughts ... This was what I thought until I read this informative note on the Apple site that left me somewhat thrilled: "" iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are resistant to water, splashes and dust; they have been tested in the laboratory under controlled conditions, with an IP67 rating according to the IEC 60529 standard. The resistance to water, splashes and dust is not a permanent feature and could decrease with normal wear. Don't try to charge your iPhone when it's wet; consult the manual to clean and dry it.The warranty does not cover damage caused by liquids. "" So my advice is to be careful and consider this as an additional level of protection. Of course, you can safely use it with wet hands or in the rain, but I advise you to avoid immersing it completely or exposing it to the direct jet of water. The touch-sensitive home button: the Home key that despite retaining the Touch ID function, which as we know it serves to unlock the device by scanning the fingerprint or to make payments through Apple Pay, it represents a novelty and a revolution as for the first time in the history of Apple, we are not in front of the classic physical key but one touch consisting of a sensor, called Taptic Engine, capable of measuring finger pressure, in Force Touch style. With a little pressure it therefore returns a tactile feedback, offered by the internal motors and customizable, similar to the physical button. The same function, therefore, but in a body and in a different technology. An intelligent solution if we think that this way we eliminate the problems of malfunction due to wear of the physical key. This does not, however, remove any faults in the internal sensor. In terms of touch and tactile feedback, we cannot fail to mention one of the most interesting innovations offered by iOS 10: The 3D Touch Introduced with iOS 10, the 3D Touch represents an absolute novelty for smartphones from bitten apple and is useful in different circumstances. With a prolonged and profound pressure on the icons of compatible apps we will be able to quickly access the configuration menus as in the case of the native app "Clock" where we can set an alarm or start the timer without opening the application directly. We will be able to preview the content of a website to decide in advance whether to visit it or not, to quickly write a message, an email or a whatsapp etc ... In short, an extra gear and a third dimension of the touch. The product, powered by a 1960 mAh battery and the brand new Quad Core A10 Fusion processor is sold in basic configuration, from 32 GB to 799 euros up to 1019 euros for the full 128 GB model of internal storage in silver, gold, pink gold and Jet Black (Matt Black)
5305	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	andrea m	5	Great phone	2016-11-29	it	I come from Iphone 6 and here we are definitely forward compared to the previous one, with greater fluidity in the applications, excellent camera resolution (12 mega pixels) and the practicality of always Apple devices. The only variation is precisely the absence of the physical home button replaced by one of the same but virtual shape that responds to touch (which can be calibrated). Perfect and timely delivery.
5306	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Laura M.	5	who was super willing to give me information before shipping	2017-05-15	it	The phone speaks for itself, but I must add that after having tried Android and Windows phones for years, I wonder why I waited so long to switch to the iPhone. The higher price is well rewarded by the quality / functionality / usability that other phones dream of. A praise to the seller, who was super willing to give me information before shipping: confirming that the plug is the Italian one and promising to do my best to send the product to me before the scheduled time. The product has in fact arrived the day before the indicated date and conforms to the expectations. Great seller, thank you again.

5308	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Greci Francesco	4	Great phone, just a little bit of extra process power missing	2017-06-05	it	Excellent product, top of the range of the Apple team, but it is in fact only a refinement, improvement, compared to the 6 series. Considering the above and the cost, it should be noted however that the processor power is a bit undersized compared to the Android top competition of range and so we hope that in version 8, the apple house will save less on process power.
5309	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Cliente Amazon	5	Excellent!	2017-02-24	it	No need to add anything else. IPhone 7 is the top of the range. Absolutely number 1. Using the appliance at average daily intensity, I arrive in the evening when I still have 30-40% of the battery. Excellent

Compared to the previous 5s that I have this model is thinner but wider as the screen and the photos and the response to the applications is surprising (it makes very sharp pictures with many shots so you can see the movement and choose the best by itself) not to mention the phone calls and applications that run more smoothly, ECCC

I then requested the return because I received a double gift. Returned the goods back with paccocelere 3. The seller received the goods on 11-5-17 (checked through the post office website). To date 17-05-17 I have not seen a penny back. I contacted MIPHONE, who replies once every 3 messages and is therefore very absent, and they wrote to me "at the moment we cannot handle us. The return will be amazon which will do so" ". Absolutely false, I contacted the Amazon customer service who opened a complaint to me saying that the thing is false and if he received the goods he must also proceed with the refund. Draw your conclusions about the seller. I will update the review based on the outcome of the complaint. Update: the AZ buyer protection program returned my money. 5 stars at amazon and 1 at the seller who, evidently, was banished from amazon

5319	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	michele di fronzo	5	REVIEW AFTER A MONTH OF USE	2017-05-31	it	It is not easy, at all, to review the iPhone 7. It is not even after a month of use and after we have begun to master it, the condition that we have always tried to favor when we take a new model in our hands before writing a real review . iPhone 7 is in fact a device that for many aspects confuses all the more if, like us, we are accustomed from the beginning to follow the evolution of the smartphone world of the Apple; in fact, it comes from the classic Apple groove: the one that presented us with a completely new device after a revision of the one launched two years earlier. In the case of the iPhone 7, in contrast to the "rule" we are instead faced with an aesthetically almost identical copy of the iPhone 6s, and for the transitive power of the "s" models, to the iPhone 6. In the same time behind this appearance of a device very similar to the version of three years ago, there are several new ideas and technological leaps, even if only in sketch, very important, able to change the cards on the table of the future Apple. For this reason the temptation to liquidate the review with a "read that of iPhone 6 and season it with the benchmarks that will show a faster and more powerful device" should be put aside, no matter how tempting, just by looking at the device.
5320	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Marco & Giorgia	5	My first iPhone	2017-02-09	it	And I'm so happy !! After breaking my Windows Phone with which I was still fine, I looked for an alternative and after research I convinced myself to try iPhone. Well another world, the apps are all there, the quality is very high, the phone is very nice and I was surprised by the duration of the battery .. I arrive in the evening almost always advancing 30/40% .. Very satisfied !! I would also like to thank the seller for the flawless transaction and lightning shipping !!
5321	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	salvatore mancino	5	Apple e apple!	2017-07-09	it	Inside the box we find a 1A output charger, a USB / Lightning cable, an EarPods headset with Lightning connector and an adapter to use headphones with 3.5mm audio jack ... The design is very similar to that of the iPhone 6 with the exception of the ear capsule, which is larger to also accommodate the second system speaker. The camera is slightly shifted to the left and is now 7 megapixel with stabilization .. The side keys are a little less embedded in the body and the SIM drawer it has a small gasket to protect it from water and dust. The aesthetic differences are more noticeable on the lower part where the 3.5mm audio jack disappears to make room for a mostly aesthetic grid where the main microphone is positioned. The main speaker and the Lightning port remain in place ... Aesthetic novelties also on the back. The separation bands of the antennas have been partially eliminated and the camera has a softer design, protected by a part of the shell. It also improves the flash which is now a Dual Tone 4 LED..iPhone 7 is resistant to water and dust with IP67 certification even if the damages from liquids are not covered by warranty. To offer better resistance, Apple has also redesigned the home button which now it is no longer clickable as usual but is able to recognize finger pressure by offering tactile feedback that we can customize by choosing between three different intensity levels. The button is capacitive and cannot be clicked with objects or if we wear gloves. ... summarizing is a good product and I recommend you will not regret the purchase.
5322	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Roberto Patriarca	4	Apple iPhone 7 Smartphone 4G	2016-11-10	it	The Smartphon iPhone 7 was purchased after a cost check on the major internet sites. I found the purchase economically convenient and respecting the delivery times indicated at the time of purchase. The appliance is original with warranty. In backing up the data from the old phone I had some difficulty, I turned to the Apple service, which assisted me to solve the problem with great kindness and professionalism.
5323	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Pasquale	5	Iphone 7 Great product	2016-11-18	it	Iphone 7: start this brief review on the Iphone 7 declaring me Pro Apple, but absolutely objective and critical. New hardware: the most important hardware novelty is the Home button. Unlike the previous physical key, this simply produces a tactile sensation when pressed. Memory: Unlike the previous models, this is presented with three different memories starting from 32 GB, the 128 GB one and finally the 256 GB one finally said goodbye to the 16GB model. Consequently this implies an increase in prices, the three versions of the iPhone 7 cost distinctly: 799 from 64gb, 909 from 128gb and 1.019euro from 258gb Battery: The battery of this device is clearly improved compared to the previous versions, and in case of use " normal "lasts a whole day quietly. Camera: The rear camera adopts a 12 megapixel resolution as before, with a new 28 mm f / 1.8 aperture lens with optical image stabilizer that takes better and faster photos. More light is captured in the dark and the videos are much more fluid. The flash is less involved in situations of little or poor light, but if this is used it has been clearly improved by giving images with almost natural colors. Without a doubt there is to say that iPhone has always had an excellent camera and 7 continues this tradition with safety. I would like to emphasize for selfie lovers an increase from 5 to 7 megapixels of the front camera, one of the best around right now .Screen: The 4.7-inch diagonal appears to be the same as the previous version, the resolution is also the same as the previous versions, of 750 x 1334, but the wider chromatic gamut .--> This device will most likely be remembered as the phone that "killed" the headphone jack, which in my opinion has clearly improved the sound quality and why not, even the aesthetics on the bottom is in fact a single entry / exit.Inside the packaging there is, the phone 7, charger with cable, EarPod headphones included, which connect via Lightning and an included adapter, which allows you to connect headphones with the jack through the Lightnin port g.In conclusion: I believe that apple has distinguished itself from the other brands due to the details and this time it has given its best. At the same time, however, I think that those who have an iPhone 6s should not spend all this money on an "almost" similar device. I still consider it a top-of-the-range TOP with great capabilities and I don't recommend buying much.
5324	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Akhil george	5	Iphone	2016-10-22	it	The design is basically the same as the iPhone 6 and 6S. So the same since 2014. Is it bad? Only if you consider the aesthetic novelty at all costs a value. What is certain is that the look has something familiar about it, but at the same time the sense of déjà vu is unavoidable: so many models that remind us of iPhones now, some even very pleasant (one for all: the new Honor 8). It is also true that some competitors, Samsung above all, have recovered the stylistic gap with Apple and pushed the frontiers of design further, with new solutions such as 'dual edge' screens, perhaps questionable from a practical point of view but of a sure aesthetic impact. Apple, however, did not stand still. In addition to important interventions "under the hood", in this new generation he worked on materials. Black is the banal color par excellence on a smartphone, but the two shades created for these iPhone 7 are not at all. The matt one is very pleasant, but the 'jet black' (glossy black) is magnificent. It looks like glass to the touch but is aluminum instead, transformed by a complex treatment in 9 steps. The glossy finish attracts fingerprints but less than you might think. Apple warns, however, of the possibility of 'micro abrasions' on the body: in short, the 'jet black' (which cannot be chosen in the basic 32 GB memory cut) is more delicate than the other colors. Another advantage of black iPhones is the virtual disappearance of the black bands for the antennas on the back, still visible (but less intrusive than in the past) in the other three shades of silver, gold and pink. Purists will instead continue to hate the bulb of the camera that protrudes from the body: on the Plus it is now more visible than ever A strength of the iPhone 7 is its resistance to water and dust.
5325	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Ettore Minucci	5	VERY BEAUTIFUL	2016-09-27	it	I tried carefully the new matt black iPhone 7, so I am ready to write a review, I will try to be as complete as possible! *** BOX *** The design of the package remains unchanged, but the printed image changes: if in that of the 6s was represented the front of the phone, in that of the 7 we find instead the back, which represents the main design difference between the new and old model. We find beyond the phone the wall charger with lightning cable, lightning headphones and the comfortable audio jack to lightning converter, useful if you want to use your old headphones. *** DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION QUALITY *** The design remains unchanged on the front compared to the 6s, but hidden inside the earpiece here is the second speaker, a of the main novelties of this telephone.On the back the plastic bands of the antennas are moved on the margins, it is up to you to decide if you prefer them as they were or as they were before, especially in this model opaque black, they are very pleasant because they are almost invisible, camouflaging themselves with aluminum. Finally the camera changes, which becomes larger, but probably better embedded in the body and less exposed to scratches. *** USE EXPERIENCE ** * iOS 10 is certainly a nice step forward compared to 9, in fact the "" raise to wake up "" feature is very useful which, when we lift the phone from a surface, turns on the screen to be able to unlock it immediately or simply be able to control the time without pressing any key. As you all know, there is no headphone jack, so you will not be able to recharge the phone and listen to music simultaneously if you do not use wireless headphones, sold separately. Slightly improved display and battery, and audio, thanks precisely to the double speaker, it is definitely better. Also changing the home button, which becomes Force touch, is therefore no longer clickable, but when you press it a vibration motor placed next to the button will return you a very pleasant feedback in my opinion, after a short time I assure you that you will get used to it. *** QUALITY / PRICE REPORT AND CONCLUSIONS *** The price of the product is certainly very high, the memory cuts have been doubled, excluding however the 64gb which in my opinion was the best compromise. If you already have the 6s, you will not feel the need to change. Having said that, if you want to have the latest iPhone model you have to spend a lot, and it will always be like this, but you know that you pay for the quality. ** *** FINAL VOTE: 9/10 ***** This was my thought on the new Apple matt black iPhone 7, [...] hello and the next! :)
5326	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Amazon-Kunde	4	Even the iPhones aren't always perfect	2017-01-23	it	After two weeks of use suddenly the button to raise the volume did not work anymore. It looks like a mechanical defect, because the button seemed to be pressed, but there was no way to unlock it. The exceptional service of the seller BeePlaza, which the same day in which I reported the problem, has already sent me the courier to pick up and replace the phone .
5327	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	5	Fabulous phone, one of the best on the market	2016-10-12	it	The apple 7 of the apple is a fantastic phone with an incredible camera, a perfectly balanced operating system and a fabulous screen to say the least. The new home button returns a good feed and the absence of the jack is noticeable only for the first few days, afterwards you don't notice its absence.
5328	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Meryon	5	iPhone 7 white	2017-12-15	it	It's a good smartphone, the aesthetics always very faithful to the other versions ... every time I switch to a new version I'm always satisfied
5329	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Merio	5	despite the hardware part to the numbers seems inferior to other smartphones, in practice it always behaves very well !!	2016-10-16	it	Review: Apple iPhone 7 4G Smartphone (Display: 4.7 "" - 32 GB - iOS 10) I state that I used the product for about a week to test it and be able to do a useful review to clarify the merits and defects of the product so as to facilitate your purchasing choices. A week in which I tell you immediately that I have not yet had the courage to give him the "" baby bath ", yes the waterproof telephone still seems to me a bit absurd, anyway from the videos that run they seem to be really resistant to water. UNBOXING The package together with the elegant Iphone 7, contains wall charger with Apple-specific lightning connector, these headphones also with lightning attack and not the classic 3.5mm jack, but the manufacturer has well thought of also inserting an adapter to insert headphones with a 3.5mm jack, of which we are perhaps already in possession and finally present the paper clip to extract the NANO-FIRST IMPACT. Like its predecessors, it is always really beautiful, the unique design that many manufacturers try to imitate and that together with its logo increase the price that may or may not please. 4.7 inches sounds strange when most smartphones are now around 5.5. I personally do not like phones that are too large and 4.7 inches in hand are perfect, you can easily reach every point on the screen without difficulty and without risking the phone to fall. The home button is fixed and overlapping the finger without crushing , as was the case with the previous models, you can "" command "" the phone very simply and with great responsiveness (it will only take a moment to become familiar), I liked this new proposal because one of the things I didn't like it was just the central pushbuttonDimensions of the smartphone: 6.7 x 0.7 x 13.8 cmWith the smartphonebatterybattery: The battery is from 1960 mAh which in numbers may seem few compared to other smartphones but this appears well optimized, the first few days that I had it in my hand and also used intensely to download applications and discover its qualities I managed to go beyond the day and then loading it in the mat tinata.RAM & ROM We start from 2gb RAM. While now everyone is running and inserting Ram from 4 if not 6gb that not even many of the computers on the market today can boast, this smartphone is offered with 2GB of RAM. Sufficient in my opinion, together with the A10 Quad-core Processor, they make the phone work wonderfully, it is very fluid even in the use of the heaviest applications. To also consider then that with the next updates we will surely see improvements also from this point of view. I for the ROM without thinking too much I have chosen the 32 gb version, to me these also seem more than enough.I make my considerations: it seems to me that they try to make us megalomaniacs, we must have space where we can save our photos, videos and generic files. It almost seems that 32 GB are few, even the smartphone with 256 GB of memory ?? woow! who knows if then one day it stops working..it's the end, I could have in my photos and videos since I was a newborn !! I personally prefer to upload files online or on a flash drive so as not to occupy memory and have no problems should stop working the phone. PHOTOS & VIDEOS One of the parts that has convinced me the most is this, and the videos are really exceptional, I also don't have a firm hand and that with other terminals I find it a bit difficult to stand still with this camera I found myself really well, it is very stable even when making videos, all very clean and bright even when they are made in low light. Also in this case then with the updates they will intervene and surely improve the photo-video department. The camera protrudes but with the cover that I think is necessary you solve the problem AUDIO Other part that I liked but God forbid since the producers are back in vogue thanks to the iPod is the audio. Listening to fantastic music thanks to the stereo speakers one in the lower part near the entrance for the lightning cable and one in the upper part of the display and also with nice headphones (I mainly used the ones I already possessed with 3.5mm jack) FINAL CONSIDERATIONS5 stars it seems to me right to give them to this device, yes the price is really high but we know that this is the policy of the manufacturer that charges its terminals with gold weight but it will always be like this and nothing can be done without it that tack on other smartphones. Of course I recommend this phone to anyone with a PC or tablet of the same brand as the connections between the devices are much simpler. If you have the previous model, maybe you can think of it for a moment as there has not been an abyssal change, there is time and with the new updates this smartphone will improve even more. I hope my review has been helpful.
5330	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	PACILIO ALFREDO	1	very disappointed	2016-12-24	it	At first he sent an email to change shipping methods, they were very friendly, they answered fast, very kind, they made an excellent impression. The iPhone has arrived, and it has a lot of problems with audio, I sent an email to a damaged iPhone and they didn't deign to answer. Zero seriousness.
5331	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Anna	5	perfect	2017-05-07	it	Also this time Apple does not disappoint! The best smartphone around ... Always one step ahead of everyone! I am very satisfied with the purchase!
5332	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	LB recensioni	4	iphone 7 vs iphone 6s vs iphone 6	2016-10-05	it	I will not describe the characteristics of one or the other, since the web is full of reviews, I will just make a brief comparison between the 2 devices as they are both owners of both. ESTETICA obviously very similar for both devices on the body for iphone 6s , on the sides for the 7; - The camera: the larger the shutter of 7 so THE COVER OF 6 OR 6S IS NOT SUITABLE FOR 7.-Home button: do not press more like the previous devices, but is practically in line with the panel. FUNCTIONS: In addition to the more powerful chip, there are no big differences between the iPhone 6s and 7, only for those who own an iPhone 6 with the introduction of 3D touch (very useful) an upgrade could be useful. PHOTO: The already excellent photos of the iphone 6s have not had a particular leap in quality with the new device. The only difference, now known to all is the possibility of going underwater (even if from the apple site, in small it is written that the guarantee does not covers damage from immersion in water ) From my point of view the leap in quality is achieved with ios 10, which can also be activated from 6s and 6 and which works very well. CONCLUSION: The transition to 7, for owners of 6s, I do not see very useful, especially if you have a memory of 64gb ... Different for 6, already discussed in my review https://www.amazon.it/gp/customer-reviews/R31T9UXQYUUZ2B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015A0TEY2 I hope the review you enjoyed ... ciaoo
5333	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Renato	1	REVIEW VISIBLE PARTIALLY	2016-12-24	it	Why is it that in my review of this product in the option to continue reading does not let me enter the whole view but only partial, maybe I wrote something that is not good for you to show it to users?
5334	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Lorenzo Tech	4	Why buy it and why not (read ...)	2016-11-17	it	On iPhone 7 you will find dozens of tests and reviews on the internet made by people who are much more experienced than a common fan. Many of these reviews will be lost in details that can only be understood by experts. I will tell you a few more reasons why man is worth common may decide to buy it or not.Why buy it: -for hardware at the highest levels-now it is waterproof - for design, materials and assembly-for display quality- because together with 7plus is the best smartphone in the IOS environment - because it is the technological status symbol par excellence - for the preservation of its value over time - for reliability - for the stability of the operating system - because it better protects privacy with respect to Android - for the excellent assistance service - because compared to Android it is much easier to use Why not buy it: -for the price disproportionate to the performance-for the lack of the headphone jack-because it is not a dual SIM - because the IOS ecosystem is very limiting, even just for file transfer - because the battery life is not excellent - because the cost of any maintenance is high - because it offers less possibility of customizing AndroidMoral: I find it a great device but with some major limitations for my type of use.It is of course a subjective judgment based however on objective observations. Among the standard version and the Plus version I would recommend the first for a speech of less weight and bulk as well as price, even if at the expense of battery life. [...]
5335	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Rodolfo S.	5	The latest Iphone from Apple	2016-09-29	it	I bought my iPhone on amazon but not here in Italy because it is not yet available and I also wanted more memory while this is 32GB, but I wanted to leave my opinion the same. If anyone is interested in knowing how the new iPhone7 takes photos, than at 6 and 6s, I can immediately tell you that they are better and in low light conditions they are clearly better. You can notice an impressive speed in the use and in the answers compared to the 6s, thanks to the new processors. The new opaque black color is really gorgeous, Black looks awesome !!! It's so smooth. There are no lines and it looks like a product all of a piece. I saw the black Jet shiny, it is my favorite color, but it was not available, but I can say that it is a work of art, but it is easier than it is scratches. But most people will use a cover that hides the back so maybe the color isn't that important. I love the new home button, it's took me about 5 minutes to have the same user experience and I can say that I don't miss the old home button. Overall I like it! Fastest device I've ever used. I chose the 128g version and it's perfect in size for everyone. Power Photos and videos a lot of memory, all in just 256g. The fact that it is without headphones does not bother me at all. The adapter works well with my high quality headphones. I tried the same song and with the same headphone using a 6s of a friend and 7 with the adapter and I can't say that there are any differences. The thing I like less is the display is only HD even if the visual quality is wonderful. With IPhone 4.5, 5s, 6 and SE you will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far from speed, but the difference is the same. With IOS 10 there are many new features and some bugs, that you Apple lovers know better than me, but Apple is working to solve them as quickly as possible and then I think that we will have a perfect phone or almost as it has always been with the previous versions of Iphone.If you have other curiosities contact me. Soon I will publish some shots.
5336	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	giuseppe	1	Painful	2017-09-22	it	After three days of use, the phone vibrated continuously even when switched off. Scratch speaker volume output with low volume microphone. They tell me that they don't understand anything in the call. In conclusion: one who spends about 800 euros on a phone should at least expect the top, not a totally poor product. Amazon as always impeccable in refund with refund.
5337	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Cliente Amazon	4	a query	2017-07-03	it	a query, the iPhone is released? Can it be used in Argentina? and in other countries? muchas gracias, atte, AN, a
5338	iPhone 7	32GB	Matt Black	Roberto	2	This time no quality leap	2017-02-05	it	After buying the new apple smartphone from Apple and after months of use (having had all the iphone models) I can express an opinion. Starting from the packaging you immediately notice the savings, unlike the 6s box, in particular the headphone box that this time it is in very bad cartoncino.Fino to arrive to the use proper of the cell, equal to the previous model if not worsened above all to aesthetic level. The design is the same as that of a last-generation ipod (almost anonymous). Compared to the 6s, it no longer has the physical home button but has been replaced by a fake one that does not at all give the idea of ​​pressing a button, and also lacks the headphone jack and you need to add an adapter (fortunately supplied). It is no longer possible to listen to music if the cell is charging for this reason (unless you spend 170 euros for some awful bluetooth headphones). Also I noticed that starting from 6 it is now full of lag (something that the iphone have never had at least until 5s). Fortunately, many corrections arrive thanks to the frequent updates of ios. The only positive note is that it is now water resistant but as usual apple does not cover the damages caused by the immersion of the cell in the latter, so I will not try absolutely at do it or imagine it! The speed compared to that of the 6s is practically identical in my opinion, as for the quality of the camera. Fluid only in games. I would have expected a real change and I think that for this we have to wait for a long time, at least until the iPhone 8 comes out, since the 7s will be the usual heated soup. So in conclusion neither is it worth it to go from 6s (64gb) at 7 (32gb)? DEFINITELY NO! By now the competition is offering much better products at a lower price. This iphone is fortunate to always be a fashionable item but in the long run if apple won't be woken up I don't think I'll buy it anymore!
5339	iPhone 7	128GB	Matt Black	Graziano Ferrucci	1	Worse than 6!	2016-10-26	it	I went from 6 to 7. Mah! Absolutely worse! Better the 6!

5341	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	gad	3	Screen not original	2019-07-15	it	It was a nice surprise to see that the phone had no scratch. It was like new. Unfortunately, as soon as I put it next to an original Apple, I realized that the brightness of the screen was not good. After a while the screen started to have defects, like doubling the image. 'they changed but after a few weeks again, it doesn't work well. With such a screen, the Apple store didn't want to take it back for review, because it's not the original. Sorry to trust it

Given the not inconsiderable amount a bit 'the fear of making such a purchase on the internet there was ... but given the excellent reviews I decided to trust. Well I couldn't make the right choice !! Serious and reliable seller, I received the order even 48 hours later! Original packaging, all new and impeccable, sealed and cellophane. Unique, small, inconvenience: the USB charging cable was missing, even though there was a wall socket, etc. The seller, however, did not hesitate to send me one immediately, although it is clear that it is not an original Apple. But for the price paid and the service I still had, I couldn't ask for better!

Of course, no problem whatsoever is ever blocked. Excellent display, excellent camera, battery lasts one day if under stress, two days with normal use of 3-4 hours a day. The only flaw, but not his fault, is the cloud storage space, only 5GB for all Apple products. For those who need it, of course, they can buy more space, but 5gb free are a bit few

The battery life unlike other old generation iPhones lasts a full day of intense use without problems, obviously the first few days of use with one hand is not very comfortable to use due to its rather large dimensions but it's worth it for one screen so defined and beautiful then slowly takes the habit even with the use with one hand ..

In addition to having purchased at a very competitive price compared to the official sales channels and the most famous commercial chains, this iphone plus is definitely more reactive, capacious and the battery is very powerful.

5395	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Matt Black	tmark	5	the evolution ...	2017-06-27	it	.... it is from version 4 that I married the apple and every time it seems to me impossible to improve the last series .... yet this time too it has separated the 6s plus by two lengths. Excellent product, excellent yield, excellent battery and decidedly pleasant innovations (absence of the home button and double camera) which in my opinion are not a facade but substantial. I also recommend it as an upgrade from the 6s plus because it's worth it anyway.

5420	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Argent 	Nikola	4	If you need an iPhone, buy this and be sure	2019-01-23	it	I will briefly tell you about my experience with this iPhone, after having used it for more than 5 months ... consider that I had the jet black version. The battery being so voluminous lasts quite a while and you arrive at the end of the day without worries. Charging the battery is quite fast and in 1 hour and a half or 2 you can fully charge it. Great nice device from the aesthetic point of view but one thing I really have to say ... But making an oleophobic layer on the back too, doesn't it? With what it cost you could include it in the production process. It's up to you to hold the cover because it's pretty sensitive to scratch the back, but now you don't even do normal phones anymore, without one having to buy a cover. Turning to the front, the screen is really one of the best and not tired looking at it. The fingerprint sensor is really fast and lightning-fast, no criticism. The phone itself is lightning fast in the various operations, like every iPhone by the tronde. Excellent RAM management because it manages many apps in the background at the same time. GPS is the thing I love most about iPhones, because it takes very little to find the position and it is really very accurate. Very nice sound when you are listening to something from the phone, because both the speaker at the bottom and the one of the calls (front on the screen) act simultaneously, favoring a sound that is really pleasant, congratulations for this functionality to Apple. Instant and fast Bluetooth connection, as well as Wi-Fi. Easily hold various types of games without any lag, including Fortnite ... attention that can heat up on the back with prolonged use of the games. The camera is the thing I loved most about this phone, because it really makes unique photos ... it is the best camera-phone still in my opinion, not considering the current flagship devices (Iphone XS, XR). I believe that the camera in a device is very important, because we can capture important moments in our lives (I would avoid talking about selfies and 50 photos in a row made with a slice of bread or what we eat ... just take pictures of food), people must understand that the moments to be immortalized are very different. The first steps of our son, birthdays, moments spent together after so many years since you last saw each other with distant relatives, concerts ... in short, you have understood, things that will remain in history and our future offspring .... you want really leave photos of what you ate or your drunk photos to your children or grandchildren? I love the time of snapshots, why? You had to stand still as much as possible so as not to make a photo move, and you couldn't waste the cartridges .... firstly because they cost an eye. I know the temptation is strong but don't do it ... for god's sake. Having said that the iPhone 7 Plus is more than a great device and I definitely recommend buying it. Better this or an Android phone ?! I personally have tried several phones, but for a value for money, you will find it hard to find a better camera in a phone and that guarantees performances like those of the iPhone. Well if you want a better camera, I recommend: If you want to stay on an iPhone, take this, the 7 Plus. If you want to switch to Android, I recommend the Galaxy s9, or the OnePlus 6T ... too many, commas, suffice. But why remove the headphone jack? The excuse of space is not acceptable. Good luck in your decision.
5421	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Matt Black	TonDel	5	iPhone 7 Plus matte black - neophonia	2017-05-10	it	Phone arrived in the original sealed box and in turn inserted into a cardboard box is surrounded by paper to avoid shocks.Neophonia sent immediately: telephone ordered on Thursday and arrived on Monday (would have arrived Saturday but the courier was closed). All perfect
5422	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Rose Gold	aleledo252	4	Fantastic	2017-04-15	it	I am very satisfied with the purchase and the excellent price proposed by Amazon. The first parcel arrived damaged and the courier sent it back without even delivering it, but when I contacted Amazon customer service they fixed everything with the usual efficiency. The phone itself is the non plus ultra, but I didn't give 5 stars because in my opinion having a single lighting entrance is rather uncomfortable. Earphones cannot be used for charging and right now the splitters on the market do not have good ratings. For all the rest, first and foremost, it's worth all the € 879 I paid for it. I suggest if possible not to be tempted by the 32 Gb model because the photos with this resolution take up a lot of space.
5423	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Matt Black	alexio350	5	impeccable	2017-06-03	it	I switched to this model after a couple of years of the iPhone 5S. The iPhone 7 Plus has a screen with an excellent resolution, big enough to make it easy to watch a movie. At the same time, the phone is thin and despite its large size, it is handled quite easily and fits in your pocket without problems. The camera (12 mega pixels) excellent, with zoom takes excellent photos. The processor is powerful, fast and offers massive responsiveness in all conditions. Another implementation took place in the home button: the iPhone 7 does not have a real button but a kind of reactive touch sensor. Every time this "" virtual "button is pressed, the cell phone transmits a small, very pleasant vibration; so much so that it seems to have a "live" instrument in your hands. " The battery has been implemented in a sensitive way: even with intense use, you get to the end of the day without problems. The device is now non-underwater, but at least water resistant. In short, as many have already pointed out, apparently the mobile phone is very similar to the previous models; in reality in daily use we realize the many small and big improvements that Apple has made. It is always the same product, in short, but refined to achieve excellence. However, at least one mistake Apple did it with this model: eliminate the standard attack to use headphones. In this way, either you use the Apple headphones (already adapted) or you need to have a small jack (included, but easy to lose) to adapt the headphones to the attack. Apart from that, we have a cell phone with a high cost (we are around 1,000 euros at full price) but to which you can find very few weak points.
5424	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Matt Black	micabisc82	5	Sensations of use: comparison between iPhone 7 Plus and predecessors	2016-10-19	it	I have been using this smartphone for 3 months, after having owned, over the years, several other models (iPhone, 3s, 5, 5s and 6), some with contracts and other companies. As always, the convenience of telephone company offers that can reduce purchase costs should be carefully checked. My opinion is that the 7 plus, for general quality, justifies the fact of having to carry a very large phone in your pocket and / or handbag (photo compartment, screen, audio without headphones are better than all the predecessors; the battery lasts very long, often if I don't use it intensely for video it lasts me even two days). It's comfortable in my hand, I often use it with a hand to write, it's well balanced. I do not regret not having taken the smallest model but personally I would not go back; the price difference is quite large, but in absolute terms, given what those who can afford the iPhone7 can spend a little more and take this, it's worth it (from the price list it costs about 15% more than the model -plus). I find it obviously very powerful, very fast for all the functions in which I used it ... and God forbid! I have never used headphones very much, so I can't judge the goodness of removing the jack, nor the practicality of this choice: but I remember when Apple took away the optical reader from the Macbook and everyone shouted at the scandal ... The telephone section is perhaps the least satisfactory one: the voice is clear but a little metallic, so much so that if you put the speakerphone on or the headphones change not only volume but also timbre. Nothing inexcusable but still noteworthy, a feature that did not happen with previous models. Very good reception, instead, everywhere. Excellent certified resistance to water and dust. This offers both greater tranquility in use (the phone is always with us: in your pocket when it rains, near the sink when we cook, unfortunately sometimes even at the table while we eat ... and a little water or other liquids sooner or later it can rain on it, even if it is obvious that this is not a sub phone) it is more tranquility in case of malfunction, because the warranty applies to all cases where before they could dispute that the phone had been wet. Price consideration. The price is very high: from the Apple list € 939, € 1049 and € 1159 for the 32 models (unusable in my opinion) 128 and 256 GB: however on Amazon it varies a lot and you have to buy only if there are no other offers cheaper in around, check it out! However, it is known, a very expensive phone: this is the Apple policy, take it or leave it. I gave 5 stars despite a price that for "pure" technical content is very high, as always at Apple. The consideration on the price is important for everyone, but for me I know that I will use this tool at least 4 hours a day, every day, for at least a year or maybe two: I will have all the time to amortize the costs - I who am always been satisfied with Apple, using a smartphone every day that is, for my needs, the state of the art.
5425	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Gold	Silvia	4	Excellent evolution of the previous models, but at what price! (eye that the model in the photo is the iphone 7 "" smooth "")	2016-10-01	it	PREMISE September also arrived this year, and with autumn comes, as usual, the new iPhone. However, this year's novelty is not the new iPhone itself, but rather Apple's abandonment of the habit of updating stylistically the phone is now two years old, limiting itself to restyling in the intermediate years, whose name is the same as that of the previous model, with the addition of an "" S "". Iphone 7, in spite of the name, is basically an iPhone "" 6S "" s, that is the model of last year, with an extra "S". I don't say that the news is missing, it's simply not the new model that many waited, why is this happening? Because many now buy iPhone with 30/36 month contracts, so Apple is adapting to this, allowing its customers to have a new model every time a telephone contract ends (signing a new one). Or, as someone thinks, Apple is a little short of ideas or news that can be concretely realized and sold. The review of a product like iPhone 7 will not be short, but I have tried to make it into sections, so that everyone can read or skip the different parts, according to one's own interest. But let's start with the actual review. PACKAGINGThe box is made with the usual sturdy cardboard, typical of Apple products, and has about the size of the phone, or 9.6 x 17.5 x 4.8 cm, and presents, on the front, a photo of the phone seen from the back, naturally with the color of the iPhoine contained. Sideways the iPhone and the apple writing, always in the color of the phone and transparencies, while on the back we find the model codes, capacity and a text in different languages ​​(including Italian), which indicates the contents of the package and the requirements for the operation of our iPhone.Inside, the phone, protected with a plastic film to be removed, a small cardboard container inside which we find two stickers of the apple, the paper clip to insert the sim, and a few sheets, which explain how start using the phone. Under the small power supply with USB output, the USB-lightning cable to connect the phone to your PC / Mac or to the power supply, the headphones, which now no longer have the classic jack that we all know, but the proprietary apple connector called lightning, and an adapter, to connect our old headphones with jack socket to the lightning port of the phone. Note, that the new headphones have lost the rigid box that kept the old earpods, and so now we will find ourselves with loose headphones in the bag (or in the desk), which in addition to being unpleasant in itself, risks causing the headphones to be damaged prematurely. Fortunately, if you have an old pair of earpods, you can retrieve the plastic box, putting the new headphones in place of the previous ones, thus guaranteeing headphone safety and order. The power supply should be the 5W A1400 model. I say "" should "", because the technical characteristics are printed in medium gray on a light gray background, and are very small, so it is almost impossible to read the model or the electrical characteristics. I do not agree with this choice, because I believe it is my right to know what I buy, and to be able to buy an equivalent product elsewhere. Note that even on the box or on the site, these features are present. PHONE We ​​insert the sim, as with previous models, and turn on the phone. While starting up, a quick glance outside: at the front it is indistinguishable from previous models, with the 5.5 "" screen, the touch id with a ring matching the shell, the camera for selfy, the light sensor environmental and the loudspeaker used in call and for the speakerphone. Turning it, we find the Apple crest, which is shiny and reflective like a mirror, the iPhone writing, a few initials, the camera, and a small microphone.The camera will be double and protruding, accompanied by a bi-color LED, positioned as usual in the upper left corner. At the upper and lower edges, the two classic lines, white in my case, but whose color depends on the color of the phone's body, which serve to guarantee the functioning of the telephone and data transmission parts. It must be said, that not even 10 days after the purchase, and with the phone always in a case, the white lines already tend to get dirty, and they do not seem very easy to clean. At the top there is nothing, on the right side the button of switching on the trolley to insert the SIM (all strictly in the same color as the shock), and the two lines also on the back. On the opposite side, the volume keys, and the selector to mute the phone, even here all in the same color as the body. Below, the lightning connector for charging or connecting accessories, and two side grids, which contain the microphone for phone calls, a speakerphone speakerphone, and probably some other sensor. Ignition is fast enough, and after about 26 seconds the phone will be operational. The display is very clear, because it boasts a full HD resolution, which is the same as on many 40 "" televisions, giving a feeling of glossy material on which the fingers slide well, and is sensitive to pressure. In practice, placing your finger on the screen, for example in correspondence of an icon, we will see the background blur as we press. The more intense the pressure, the more blurred the background will appear, and vice versa. But the purpose of this sensitivity, of course, is another. With a slight pressure (actually not always easy to get), we will enter the mode that allows us to move the icons or delete some installed program, while a more determined pressure (but always without exaggeration), will give access to new functions, like the preview of the selected mail, the opening of a contextual menu that resembles that of windows that opens with the right mouse button, and many other functions that depend on the single application. The fingerprint reader is very fast, but not is based more on a physical key. Like the display, it is a pressure sensitive surface, also equipped with a small motor, which vibrates, removes the finger, and conveys a sensation similar to the old physical key. For the first uses, it will seem strange to you, inhabited by the previous keys, but after a few hours you will no longer notice the difference. The problem, if anything, will be that being a "" key "managed by the operating system and not physical, in case of problems with some program, you risk not being able to count on the only button of the iPhone, which in the past allowed us to close a frozen app. Of course, with the phone switched off, try pressing the button, it will give the same feeling as pressing on the display: nothing happens. The battery will allow one to three days without charging: today, for example, in 13 standby, with wi -fi and Bluetooth always on, very limited use (some WhatsApp and mail control in push, but no call), the phone has consumed less than 25% of battery. Surely in areas with weak signal, or with a more intense use the battery it will download faster, but the iPhone Plus has always allowed me to arrive at night without problems. Personally the back without the lines and with the dual camera of the 7 plus model seems to me a bit "heavy", and does not convince me completely, but maybe you just have to get used to it.The lines of the previous 6s, broke a little, making the phone appear less "" a brick "", especially on light colors. Here, however, these are subjective evaluations, so everyone decides according to their own sensations and tastes. The dimensions are important (about 7.8 x 15.8 x 0.8 cm), but the phone holds well in hand, even if after long phone calls, you may feel your fingers annoyed, due to the large size and limited thickness. Unable to write using the phone with one hand, as was the case with iPhone 6 Plus and 6S Plus, because you will not get to the leftmost keys of the keyboard (for example the "" key "), and I recommend a cover, that makes the bottom of the phone less slippery, because it's shiny. If you find all the models, colors and materials: with less than 10 euros you will find excellent covers, made by specialized companies, and you can get cover for tens or hundreds of euros, for those who just can't be satisfied.The phone, finally, it is classified IP67, therefore it resists to water splashes. It does not mean that you can immerse it in water without risk, because Apple will not replace a failed phone due to water entry for free, but if the phone should unfortunately fall into the pool, the chances of damage will be reduced. For the chronicle, InternationProtection67 means: "" equipped with a casing totally protected against dust (and against access with a wire) and protected against the effects of the dive "". In any case, it is a beautiful phone, which will hardly pass unnoticed, especially if inserted in a transparent cover. TELEPHONE PARTY When passing from an iPhone 6 Plus to this one, I had the clear feeling that the telephone was receiving less. In several places where before I had signal, however weak, iPhone 7 plus clearly says "" no signal "". I don't have the possibility to make measurements, because I sold my previous phone, but so it is. It also happened to me, in a couple of phone calls, that I couldn't hear the other person. The feeling was that of a speaker covered with tinfoil, which attenuates the voice, alters it and makes the speech incomprehensible. I had no problems with hands-free car or headset systems, as much as I may have tried them in a few days. When there were no problems I mentioned, the car on call was clear and, always with good volume. No problem with wi-fi or bluetooth connections. Missing nfc.FOTOCAMERA Even if the camera is protruding and less "beautiful" aesthetically than the previous models, the pictures taken are not bad at all. The phone has two cameras, one for "" normal "" photos, and one for "" zomm 2x "" photo mode, again without software interventions.For those who are not satisfied, the operating system allows digital enlargements (ie with loss of quality, just to be clear), up to 10x. The colors appear saturated and the colors are very pleasant. Present the optical stabilizer to reduce the risk of blurred photos, and the usual "" moviola "" and "" time-lapse "" modes, which will give us slow-motion or accelerated videos, but which will require support for the phone, so to have stable resumptions. Other effects will soon arrive, such as the blurred background, which will allow us to take even more beautiful pictures. Automatically, unless you turn it off, the photos will be taken in live mode. What does it mean? That the phone will take the picture, but it will also take a video of a few seconds, and pressing the display when the photo is displayed, you will be able to see the movie. Pleasant in some situations, it is completely useless in most cases. Imagine a picture of a building, and imagine what will happen if you watch the video: you will see passers-by moving, and the scene wobbling, if you took the picture hands-free. Powerful rear flash, which now relies on 4 LEDs, of two different colors, in order to illuminate the different scenes, without altering (too much) the colors of the subjects photographed. The focal length is equal to f / 1.8 for the normal camera, and f / 2.8 for that relative to the 2x zoom. This means beautiful photos in classic mode, and darker photos using the zoom (but they will also darken when recording slow motion video). The 12 megapixels of each sensor, allow detailed photos in all situations, although it should be remembered that given the size of the sensor, you will not have to expect photos similar to those obtainable with an SLR, perhaps associated with lenses that cost themselves as much as a iPhone 7. Wanting to make a comparison with the most famous competitor, the Galaxy S7 edge, I would say that as the quality of the photos we are at the same (excellent) levels, even if the samsung phone has a focal aperture of f / 1.7 (so it makes sharper and clearer photos in low light conditions), but a less powerful flash, and a single sensor. AUDIO Another novelty of this model is stereo audio. In practice, activating the speakerphone, the audio will be produced both from the loudspeaker at the bottom, near the lightning connector, and from the loudspeaker that we normally use to call, that is the one positioned above the display. The feeling is of a good volume (not very strong, but sufficient), coming mainly from the speaker at the bottom. The bass is there, although it is possible to reproduce it with such small speakers, so listening is pleasant for all types of music. With headphones, the sound improves and the volume is naturally higher. Absent, as per the historical apple policy, the possibility to set one's own song as a ringtone, unless you cut it and limit it to a few tens of seconds (I think the maximum is 30 ").The classic 3.5 mm audio jack has disappeared, a sign that Apple obviously does not like the standards shared with other companies. The result? That all the current headphones (and on the market there are also professional ones of 500/1000 euros), should be replaced. Of course, an adapter is provided, to connect the old headphones to the lightning port, but if you forget it at home, you lose it, or you simply don't want an extra footprint connected to the phone, you will have to change the headphones. Plus, being the only connector, you won't be able to listen to music and charge the phone together, unless you use adapters or sideburns. All this for what? Cost reduction? No, the phone has an internal speaker, so the circuitry to play analog music remains. Phone size reduction or use of the space previously used by the audio jack to increase battery capacity? Maybe. Increase audio quality? No, because the lightning connector transmits electrical signals such as the headphone jack through the contact between different conductors, and the sound quality depends mainly on the characteristics of the headphones, more than on their connector. Maybe the new connector will be more stable, so there won't be the typical rustling of headphones when you rotate or move the connector, but I don't think the average user will feel the difference a lot. Perhaps, and it is my opinion, Apple was interested in giving a boost to the headphone market after buying beats. I do not deny that this solution can lead to better headphones, which can adopt the most suitable (and expensive) circuitry inside them, without depending on the audio source to which they are connected, but this will take time, for the average user (who does not buy headphones from 200/300 euros) will not bring any advantage, and will lead to the death of the only true universal standard left. In fact, now even the competing smartphone manufacturers have declared that they want to abandon the audio jack, pointing to USB type C, so be prepared to change headphones, as you used to change the power supply for the phone. The search for songs on iPhone is very fast: we are still always in front of the successors of the famous iPods, even if the songs loaded on the phone (with iTunes), cannot be extracted from a pc / mac by accessing the device directly, as they are renamed and hidden.MEMORY Finally the 16GB cut disappears , which served only to sell the most capacious models to Apple, as it could not expand the memory of the phone, once purchased. The cuts are now 32 GB, suitable for the user who does not have big claims, 128 GB (suitable for the evolved user), and the 256, ideal for those who need to keep large quantities of photos, videos or audio files, both for work that for passion. Of course there are excellent audio / video straming services, but unfortunately they consume data traffic, and given the costs of Italian data contracts, when you don't have a wi-fi (secure), it's better to have your data in the dear internal phone memory. As for the choice of not being able to expand it with external cards, it is definitely a limit, but repaid by the different performances. The internal memory, in fact, is much faster than the external cards, and not having to be extracted, allows a more advanced management, without the risk of data loss in case of inadvertent removal of the card. Just to give some data, a good removable memory card has real reading speeds of several tens of MB / s (even 50/90), while an internal one can reach 3 times this speed. Unlike competitive phones, by connecting the phone to the PC / Mac, we will not be able to use it as a USB key, or copy data from it, but we will only be able to read the photos on the phone. For all other operations, such as app installation, copying documents, etc..we will have to resort to iTunes. The operating system to give a couple of numbers, during an update without pc / mac, requires to download about 2.5 GB; as many will be in use to make the phone work, and you will need more free space in the phone to install the update. Evaluate which applications you need (a satellite navigator will occupy from 1 to 4 GB, a video game from 0.2 to 2/3 GB, a normal photo of 0.003 GB and a live photo of about 0.005 GB) Having said this, each one draws their own considerations in based on your phone's use. OPERATIONAL SYSTEM is one of the simplest operating systems to use on the market. Compared to Android or windows phone, you will find that it is very easy for a person not to use technology to learn how to use an iOS device. On the other hand, this operating system is very closed, in fact you will not be able to put your favorite mp3 as a ringtone, you will not be able to mix icons and widgets, you will not be able to exchange data with your friends using bluetooth or nfc, but you will gain a stability of the system, which for the no geeks will be fantastic. Advanced users will have functions such as icloud, imessage (a messaging client like whatsapp, which only works with Apple products), and so on. The email client is one of my favorites, and is perfectly compatible with Exchange Server-based corporate mail services. Perhaps sooner or later, the Apple Pay service will also arrive in Italy, to pay off by placing the phone near a shop, without having to take out a wallet, coins, and so on. And let's not forget advanced features, such as automatically saving to the cloud of the photos taken (that we will find again on the pc / mac without the need to connect the phone and extract them manually), the possibility to share calendar and address book with Outlook on your pc, and also with other devices, for example Android. The voice assistant Siri is also very comfortable, who may not always understand what we are asking him for, but which on the whole is not bad at all. Added in iOS 10, also a function that stores where we park the car automatically, and helps us find it again (a feature that was also in Android for years, but that seems more precise here, at least compared to the phones I have tried). PRICEIphone 7 plus starts at just under 1,000 euros. Is it worth the money? Honestly it is a great product, and Apple's support is excellent, but the answer can only be one: no. Everyone makes his own money what he wants, and each person gives the various material goods the value he believes, but objectively, iPhone 7 plus has no features that justify such high prices (and always higher every year). A Galaxy S7 Edge of 32 GB with Italian warranty, is on the 500 euros, and with similar figures take home even the top of the range HTC or Huawei, looking at the android world. Looking at windows phone, then, the top of the range is at even lower prices, even if only slightly. But iPhone is iPhone. If you want a device with 256 GB of integrated memory, you have no alternative.If you want a product that everyone will envy you and let you notice, you have no alternative. The Apple ecosystem is one of the most rewarding, but also one of the most expensive. Do you want an original Apple cover for your new phone? 50 euros (compared to 10 for a great non-Apple cover). And the same goes for all the other accessories, including headphones (if you haven't read the "" AUDIO "" section, I invite you to do so now). Apple products devalue less than competing phones, that's true, but now on the market of used products, of Apple products if they are found galore, therefore also on Apple, we start to find some shop that applies discounts on the new one, something that until a little time ago was a heresy, and the price of the used is always more interesting. Why does Apple always raise prices? Because there are always so many people willing to buy its products, and this is the very simple law of supply and demand. The price of a product, consumers do it above all, and evidently, the mass is good that iPhone costs so much. APPLE CARE PLUSApple supplies the device with only one year of direct warranty, leaving the seller with the burden of supplying you possible second year (if you buy the product as "" consumers "" and not as "" company ""). In general, Apple products are very solid, and if treated with a little bit of tension, they tend to last over time and not present problems. Be aware, however, that the warranty provided by Apple during the first year, and that provided by the ventor in the second year, will be extremely different, and this is due to the high quality standards that Apple tries to keep. Those who want to be assisted by apple also in the second year, and have additional coverage against any damage even caused by the same user, can activate Apple Care plus. The purchase must be made within 60 days from the purchase of the phone, and provides a test of the product by apple, done remotely via the internet. If the test does not indicate problems, you can buy Apple Care Plus at a cost of 149 euros. With this figure, you will be guaranteed premium assistance, and the ability to repair the phone twice, at a pre-determined price. If the display breaks, in fact, the repair will cost only 29 euros, while a damage that requires the replacement of the telephone (with a regenerated one), will provide a fixed cost of 99 euros. Without this extended warranty, the breakage of the display will cost 167 euros, while a complex repair can reach 380 euros. My previous iPhone 6 plus, in two years, has never requested paid assistance (so the money spent on the apple care was "" thrown away ""), but everything depends on many factors, luck first and foremost. The advice if the phone is important to you, and in case of problems you want to be able to bring you to the apple store, knowing you are going to leave the problem within an hour, whatever the trouble. For a normal user, who may take care of the device carefully, the choice is more personal, and depends only on how much "" you want to be calm "". Be aware, in any case, that even in the event of a paid replacement, you will be provided a phone the same as yours.No color changes, no possibility of changing the model, not even paying an extra charge. DETAILS Even now, as with every launch of a new iPhone, you start talking about its flaws too. Some users complain about occasional problems during phone calls, with the interlocutor not understandable at all. Others complain that the phone, when very stressed (for example because you are playing), emits a slight hiss, as if there were an audible fan. Still others complain that sometimes the headphone remote control does not work or that turning off the airplane mode does not hang up the network. Probably other defects will come out in the coming weeks, and we hope that Apple is able to remedy promptly, perhaps with a simple software update. I found audio problems on call, and a slight decrease in the ability to hook up the telephone signal, compared to previous models. Of course, by going to an Apple store, it is likely that the phone will be replaced: but really, after spending 1,000 euros for a new phone, and having used it a month, would you accept to go home with a refurbished one (so used)? It will not be easy to understand what is true in all the complaints that will be read, but it is perhaps worth keeping an eye on any developments. JAILBREAK All versions of iOS, sooner or later, have been "" pierced "" by some hacker, allowing jailbreak of the device. In the past it made sense, as it allowed them to buy apps that Apple censored, and to personalize their phone much more powerfully. Now, without really special needs, I no longer think the game is worth the candle. You have to waste time, you risk finding your phone infected with some malware (which could still install itself, though more difficult), you lose functions or applications, which detecting the jailbreak stop working ... all to really earn few features, since now iOS is really mature. CONCLUSIONThis is a great product, and if you can spend this amount, I can't help but anticipate that you will be satisfied. It is faster than iPhone 6S Plus (maybe it does more or less the same things, but this is a detail) :) and much faster than iPhone 6 Plus. Is it worth an upgrade? In my opinion, from iPhone 6S Plus no, as happens every year, while updating an iPhone 6 Plus, I would say that makes more sense. If you then add an Apple Watch, the user experience will be even better.
5426	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Matt Black	Marco Gaglianello	2	poor	2017-03-16	it	Now iPhone loses and this 7 plus is the confirmation. At 200-300 € there are android terminals that allow the user to do many more things, they are more versatile and above all they have an o.s. which has much less bugs than iOS (which carries the same problems from the 7.0 to the present day, absurd). If you have money to waste and you are iPhone fanatics then there is, but otherwise look elsewhere, your wallet will be happy .

5430	iPhone 6S	32GB	Rose Gold	Maya & Carmen	5	Great!	2019-03-12	it	Then the phone arrived within the expected time frame 48 h, sealed as new with all the accessories intact inside, also sealed with lots of film as if purchased from the store; it lights up well it charges the battery well I would say that at the moment it is more than fine it has no scratch, it is in excellent condition! The only thing seems to me a little slow in installing the applications and transcribing from the old everything but I will certainly not give a star in less because for me it is fine so considering that the level of cost is also a great deal, then iPhone is always iPhone I had doubts in the purchase online but I am very very satisfied! Arrived between the other yesterday so if you have any problems later I will write for sure
5431	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gray	Luca	1	the iphone does not charge	2017-06-22	it	I waited a week for the iPhone to arrive and I immediately had to send it back because it didn't load. I would have expected amazon to better control the used products as the description says that the product is working properly
5432	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Anna85	5	Excellent purchase	2018-08-12	it	I bought this iPhone for my mother because I was tired of the various malfunctions of Android devices and because I only use iPhone. Although the device is reconditioned the battery is perfect, the only thing that differentiates it from a new iPhone is a small scratch on the body but practically invisible. My mother has been using it for a couple of weeks but found no problems. Arrived on time!
5433	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gray	Gianluigi	5	my first purchase on Techbuy Italy	2016-02-04	it	I didn't know the store and I used it for the first time, as it offered the best price for my iPhone 6s I was looking for. The expedition has anticipated the scheduled time of 2 days despite having made the purchase on Friday evening. In conclusion all was perfect, the site is excellent, the only drawback is the lack of telephone contact.
5434	iPhone 6S	32GB	Gray	Elisa	1	Not even a month of use, cell. does not start charging any more	2019-04-06	it	Purchased less than a month ago, after I could not recharge the phone due to force majeure, this was obviously off due to low battery. Connected to the cable the following day, battery does not give signs of life, it does not charge, and even with the combined buttons you can start the phone. Update: after a month the phone has not been repaired because I have to disable a function. I am informed that I will be returned and then once I reset I will have to send it back for repair. after a few days they insist on replacing the mobile phone or making me a refund, despite insisting that I have work data inside and I have to recover it. I would like to know where the phone is? Amazon disappointment.
5435	iPhone 6S	32GB	Gray	Salvatore	5	Excellent!!	2017-08-31	it	Well what about the product is perfect, it arrived sealed in the original packaging with lots of adapter for the Italian sockets. The phone has no scratches or malfunctions, so a good buy.
5436	iPhone 6S	128GB	Gray	ALBERTO D.	5	Exactly what you expect	2019-03-19	it	High quality device, you may like it or not, but it's an iPhone 6s. If one buys it, with that he has what he wants. With Prime no nasty surprise, and I confirm that it is brand new, packaged and sealed, all as it should be.I made for a friend (I am more Android oriented, but so much so), until now I have not yet pulled it back, so I assume it's okay.
5437	iPhone 6S	32GB	Gray	Filippo Ronco	4	Compact, slim and reliable	2019-03-21	it	All the apple beauty in one of the latest iPhones that you can handle with one hand. The design is wonderful, the price, bought after a few years from the release, is exceptional. It's still snappy and responsive, with no lag whatsoever. The battery in normal mode easily lasts an abundant day and in energy-saving mode even up to two days. Extremely satisfied with the purchase, fast Amazon delivery in less than 24 hours from the order (with prime).
5438	iPhone 6S	32GB	Rose Gold	Cliente Amazon	3	Good but not very well	2017-11-17	it	It arrived on time and inside the original sealed box, complete with a guarantee.

5439	iPhone 6S	32GB	Gold	matia	5	Great!	2019-02-04	it	Product arrived safely and on time. Given the price I was a little worried that it was reconditioned, instead it arrived new and with original cellophane.

5442	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent 	Louis	3	Ok. But exaggerated price	2019-06-01	it	Apple original phone, but paying € 350 for an iPhone 6s in 2019 is crazy. I took it only because I needed it otherwise there is something better around. Anyway the phone is fine, it works, so I can't complain
5443	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Federico	5	iPhone 6s pink really beautiful color	2017-01-15	it	What to say is an iPhone 6s that already knows its functionality and how it works. Shipping has arrived punctually and fast the product is obviously good and the pink color is really very beautiful.

5446	iPhone 6S	32GB	Rose Gold	alice	3	Benin	2019-03-10	it	The old 5c was better .. iPhone 6s is not the best Apple product. The camera is often enchanted, the battery lasts a few hours, sometimes the screening is implanted. It could have been better
5447	iPhone 6S	32GB	Rose Gold	Cliente Amazon	4	Excellent purchase	2018-04-20	it	It arrived before the expected delivery time. Mobile phone of excellent quality, working perfectly, only a pity for the headphones that were planned and did not arrive. The official Apple charger. Overall very good evaluation

5494	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gray	Leo	5	iPhone 6S OK	2016-04-15	it	This jewel of Apple certainly needs no introduction. Really top performance, Updated to iOS 9.3.1 the system does not seem to have any problems, apart from some minor flaws here and there like all systems on the other hand. The model ordered by this retailer (Lizard Technologies Di Antonio Buono) mounts the processor A9 produced by TSMC and not the one manufactured by Samsung (look at Telefonino.net review on youtube). Joint product with perfect packaging. The retailer asked me (after requesting an email invoice) to leave approval and advice on how to improve the service offered. Well, a serious and punctual reseller, you cannot improve what is already excellent.
5495	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Luca Spotti	5	great phone	2016-12-07	it	I will not dwell on widely-treated technical aspects. I was able to compare it with other tops of gammi and the 6s is really remarkable. The product arrives in its box with Italian battery charger, earphones included. European Guarantee 2 years. Thin, light, fast, great photos, beautiful rose gold color (I like it too). Avoid the 16Gb version, as the space for apps / photos / videos / documents is too little. I haven't tried the 7 yet, but at the moment the 6s is the best iphone around.
5496	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Cliente Amazon	4	Okay product, shipping system to be improved	2016-05-18	it	I have nothing to say about the product, except that it was sent to the wrong address! He received a person who is not even from my apartment building, but luckily since we knew each other a little and so he knew he was mine, he gave it to me. What would have happened if it was another person?
5497	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Cliente Amazon	5	Very satisfied	2016-07-14	it	I was skeptical about buying this phone because of the low price that nobody else has, but in the end reading the reviews and looking like the most reliable retailer, I decided, and I did very well. The phone comes in its original box with all the accessories, it's perfect, arrived in just two days, original and works perfectly. Reliable and serious shop!
5498	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gray	Cliente Amazon	5	Full Apple style	2016-05-09	it	Well, what to say. We always talk about the flagship phone from Apple. A concentration of technology, power as well as style. The 5 stars are really deserved. Unparalleled fluidity and reliability. Surely it is not a valid upgrade but for me who came from an iPhone 4s the improvement is substantial!
5499	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Bobocop	5	Apple is always top	2017-02-07	it	Beautiful iphone especially in this new rose gold color. Functionality close to brother 6, which however weighs much more than it!
5500	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Emanuela Amadei	5	iPhone6s rosa	2016-09-19	it	arrived quickly before the scheduled date, it was the gift for the confirmation of my niece who was really enthusiastic, really beautiful
5501	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Sebiana Trapani	4	Great!	2016-08-02	it	The product is exactly as described and packed well! There were problems with delivery times, probably for the summer period. The invoice is missing, which I believe is important for warranty purposes in the Apple Store

Thank you for the Christmas gift, the phone stopped working after only 10 days. Contacted Apple support currently the phone is a replacement.

5531	iPhone 6S	32GB	Gray	ANTONIO	4	Good	2017-04-05	it	What can I say, perfect, fast, the product reflects expectations and so I bought two. The only flaw is the charger that is international and not Italian and in both cases it is defect with our current voltage and causing black cars so I trashed both of them and bought two new ones.Add: INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEE, for which only 1 years and not 2!
5532	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gray	Gentox90	5	Great	2016-03-24	it	Really a wonderful product that as I expected it did not disappoint me. I speak from Apple enthusiast that despite this, loves to try android products and I say that it is really wonderful, PHOTOS that are made really well, very defined and without seeing too much software intervention; the 12 megapixels are enough and advancing, the only negative note I have seen making a video in a poorly lit environment is that the video will be very dark. The DIMENSIONS in my opinion are perfect, I do not have big hands and therefore phones like the plus and the s7 edge remain huge, so I think this is the perfect size, made even more enjoyable in everyday use by small software implementations such as the double tap on the central button that lowers the whole screen allowing you to reach the highest points (function that I prefer over to the android that gets the entire screen of the phone smaller, because after having made our selection the screen will return to the default size). A wonderful screen that does not regret for anything screens with higher pixel density or more vivid colors.TOUCH 3D. ... nice feature, but for now, in addition to not yet being integrated in all applications, it remains secondary in my opinion .... I almost never used it a, perhaps because of the habit of not doing it, but in some games and programs I noticed that it came back really useful for some functions. BATTERY really good, more long-lived than old iPhones but also superior in duration to products like Galaxy s6 edge or s7 edge . The rest is always Apple, there are those who love it and there are those who hate it but unquestionably the optimization is the best that can be found united with the usefulness of the Apple ecosystem for those who use products of this brand. / 10

5536	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gray	Vincenzo	4	recommended but not too much	2016-06-28	it	the only (tangible) novelty compared to the previous generation is the new golden coloration that, to make the cool ones, they call "" rose gold "". all the improvements proposed under the body are not really appreciable during the daily use of standard users. the most powerful processor is fully exploited by the software update providing the usual feedback of all time. the improvements made on the Wi-Fi module seem to have put a point to the sporadic problems complained of previously. A sore point and not improved by a comma (some consider themselves satisfied for the fact that it has not worsened) remains the battery life really poor for a phone with this price. for how much they can say every time the new model comes out it is always the usual iPhone of all time, a well-made phone that works well, reliable and without too many real novelties but equally sold as if it were extraterrestrial technology. but with all the necessary pliers ...

6147	iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Numa	4	Expensive smartphone with the best operating system	2018-11-02	de	It is a TOP smartphone. The display is amazing. Extremely good color representations, very fast execution of programs. Very easy compatibility with other Apple devices (for me the main reason for buying, since I have a Mac and an iPad). The price is too high. If you have the money and want a product that will last the next 4-5 years, I definitely recommend it. If you do not want to spend so much on a cell phone, I recommend the iPhone 8. An Android phone I can and will never recommend. (Before the Xs I had the Galaxy S8). The real strength and for me one of the most important reasons is iOS. It may be that you can not "change" it, but if the terms "Linux", "root" and "boot" say nothing, then an Android smartphone has always disadvantages. Battery life is a bit poor, for this price Apple would have to install a stronger battery, so only 4 * of me.
6148	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	Jürgen	2	no enrichment!	2019-01-09	de	I actually had almost everything from Apple, ... iPad, iPad Pro, Macbook Air, now MacBook Pro, Apple Watch 2, iPhone 4,5,6,6s, now 7 and was always thrilled with the reliability and quality .But with this iPhone XS 256GB I'm out. This super mega-sharp Oled display can not be true white and black. It has a strong yellowish tinge that is unacceptable to me. Of course I have turned off True Tone and all that and even worked only in the shades of gray over the color filter = yellow! .All of my photos I made in SW with my Canon 5D mark4 have elaborately edited in Photoshop, are now yellowish. The SW effect of these images is now totally meaningless. Likewise, I find the reading on my iPhone 7 easier than the XS, since the contrast is clearer. Of course, I realize that the resolution of the OLED display is much higher, but this difference takes the human eye was not more.This not yet mature 1249 ¬ mobile phone I send back and I will buy the iPhone 8 mitguter old quality.
6149	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Macinson	4	Great mobile for a sporty price	2018-11-13	de	Now that I have skipped some devices since the iPhone 6, it was time to buy a new iPhone. Basically, of course, it was not the best moment, since the IPhones have come into new dimensions since the X - but I suspect that which will not come out so fast any more. Nevertheless, so off to the Apple Store to take the latest generation XS, XS Max and XR in the hands. Well, for someone who comes from the iPhone 6, this is obviously a visual and haptic quantum leap. The display of all devices is really the hammer, with the XR is minimal behind the top devices, since only these have an OLED display (when you look closely and depending on the content played). The size I really great and of course makes much more fun. The size and the existing "full screen" I think is really great and makes much more fun compared to the 6 Series. The "notch" (the black bar on the top of the iPhone) really does not bother at all (there may be some critics here). After a bit of testing, I chose the XS primarily because of the size, I frequently put the phone in wearing my trouser pocket, the XR is a bit too big for me. The range of functions it would probably have served me enough. After the device was now a few days in use, one must realize that one misses the missing homebutton not a second, because it has become intuitively very quickly adapted to the new handling. Even Face-ID works absolutely easily and makes it easier to log in to various apps. The camera is also top and again a good step better than the iPhone X. Overall, the performance is excellent and all functions / apps run smoothly. The battery life itself can not say much because I was charged the phone every night. I will observe this in more detail and possibly write an update. Compared to my old iPhone, it is a little bigger and when you pick it up you immediately notice a slight weight difference (a bit heavier). Conclusion: Overall, Apple has once again launched a top-of-the-line phone, but what you get in the price category may also expect. The quality is outstanding and I hope it lasts the next few years, as we are planning to drop some models again. In spite of all the praise, I pull off a star, because I find that prices have really been exceeded in the meantime. I may not complain, as I too have paid this price, but I think that even in the range of 1000 € (or slightly lower) it should be able to market its top device I hope my personal and subjective assessment helps to get a better impression of the product.
6150	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Amazon Kunde	5	Super satisfied, despite some negative reviews here	2019-03-30	de	Many reviews here make the product or seller bad. That's why I have to comment now. I've dared to buy this iPhone. And I'm very satisfied. It was just a shame that the longed for iPhone was not delivered on the announced date. "Order it in the next 45 min Goods to get done. " The iPhone did not come the next day, but the next. Well. Since you can see over it weg.Da some have written that it was a different smartphone than ordered, or even with the wrong serial number, I was skeptical. Everything checked. Everything ok. An iPhone was delivered as ordered. Serial numbers fit on the box as well as on the iPhone. Memory size and color auch.Das iPhone is a European iPhone.The leaflet is also in German.Also do not be afraid. You can buy here cheaper than Apple directly a very good phone. I hope I can some of the fear to buy a cheaper iPhone here.
6151	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Dana	5	Concerns disappeared after 2 hours	2018-11-17	de	Like so many others, I had some concerns about what the handling would do. Could I get used to the missing homebutton ?! I can reassure everyone, it ran automatically after 1-2 hours! The home button is missing garnicht.Ansonsten kit distance is the best device I've ever had! Photos and videos are outstanding! Face ID even works in the evening light and also with sunglasses and cap! In addition, ch had to think about the silver Alurand, which now shines instead of brushed as before. That looks very high quality and feels good! High price, but justified
6152	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Carolina Santos Batista	5	Original Apple iPhone, but I bought cheaper than in the Apple Store	2019-01-29	de	I'm not sure why there are some reviews that say that the phone is not original because it is and even before I received it Amazon sent me the serial code (which you can, of course, check online to see if it is valid). Came in the perfect packaging and it is exactly what Apple advertises it. Amazon is an authorized reseller for Apple and it makes no sense that this phone would not be original. Regarding the phone itself, it is an excellent phone with an awesome camera. I upgraded from the iPhone 8 plus and I'm really happy with it. If you have any cloud service subscription the 64gb are more than enough.
6153	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	SK	5	Absolut top Smartphone!	2019-02-03	de	What can I say. After 4 years with an iPhone 5s, I switched to an iPhone XS 256 GB (space gray) for Christmas. I'm still thrilled every time I pick up the iPhone. Since I can currently report nothing negative, I would like to highlight a few things that particularly inspire me: - the display is a single treat - the camera quality is really outstanding. On the iPad, the pictures look even better than on the iPhone display.- the performance is really impressive. Everything runs so smoothly-Face ID works perfectly with me. Whether in complete darkness, with / without glasses, with / without beard ... Can not confirm the negative impressions of other users in any way - Speed ​​in the WLAN and LTE network partly much better than the iPhone 5sNach just over a month, I can still However, this is better than expected, in the run-up to this was not known as a great strength of the XS. Despite the high price, I would immediately buy the iPhone XS again. Especially if you come from a 5s you're just overwhelmed in every way. So I can fully recommend the iPhone XS.
6154	iPhone XS	64GB	Argent 	Christian	5	A class phone the iPhone XS though it's actually way overpriced!	2019-04-30	de	I like the iPhone Xs very much. Only it has a very high price. Nevertheless, I bought this for a Samsung S9 Plus replacement. I love this IOS and Android can do what you want, they can not be used against the IOS. Even if a Huawei P30 Pro now has a better camera, I still opted for the iPhone XS although I'm a photographer. As good as the mobile pictures are today to day (in portraits), but if you look at these on an iMac times and the image is zoomed in (zoom in), but you can see the stark differences between a SLR camera and a smartphone. For the 0815 hobby clerk or teen who wants to make a selfie quickly and this post with Insta and co, the cell phone cameras are enough. Since it really does not matter which smartphone the upper class one takes. For me, the decisive factor is the IOS operating system and of course the almost 5 years long updates in IOS where an Android simply can not keep up (mostly Android only 2 years updates).

6156	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	MG	1	The weaknesses of the iPhone reveal themselves in detail.	2019-01-19	de	Well, I'll try to make it short. I owned the following iPhones: 3GS, 4S, 6, 6s, 7 plus and this one here, which will be the end of the journey in the Apple Cosmos. Incidentally, I use an iPad and a MacBook Pro. I do not want to go into the technical specs, which is easier to read on technical pages. For me, it's about the shortcomings of this rigid and now completely unthinkable operating system. What used to be advanced is now dusty and regressive. Some details: Siri, totally useless - "Siri navigate me home" Siri: "here is home address: street name" She does not provide the simplest things Shortcuts, the new Apple app as an automator replacement for the iOS is just laughable. 4 useful shortcuts are available, everything else is not possible due to the restrictions. The settings are now scattered completely confused: automatic brightness of the screen is not found in the screen control / brightness, but under a submenu 30 kilometers away, because of Apple is intuitive. Nevertheless, iTunes is the basis for synchronistation on the mac and on the pc, the old Romans have already used it, and even they were already annoyed by it.Landscape mode does not work well and takes a lot on most apps unnecessarily Place away - completely embarrassing support of the top models. (Not xs related) Hand off (model overarching work) works completely unreliable, sometimes not for weeks, then again. Any individualization of the operating system is impossible. Turn off wifi does not mean: wifi off. Price is now unacceptable, even if the value stability Well, I could go on forever ... and that's why it will probably in the future, which is still far, a leak out of the entire Apple cosmos mean. Certain things are just too much of a good thing. Can others do better? Let's see .. but the most basic things you should already be able to trust the almost most valuable company in the world at this time - but this seems clearly too much to ask.
6157	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Stefan80339	4	Great phone, expensive repairs, frustrating Face ID	2018-12-21	de	In principle, there is not much to say about an iPhone. Nevertheless, a few comments: - same day delivery in Munich has not worked-the first model came to a fault and did not turn on. Amazon was very fast in exchange and has already sent a replacement before I had given up the old.- Compared to the 6 or 7 model, the phone is really heavy-glass repair costs are really expensive, 591 Eur if front and back are concerned. - I do not have the home button, one-hand operation is virtually impossible - Face ID only works moderately. This one must look at the phone pretty directly. Does it not, because it is e.g. lying flat on a table or in a handsfree, then Face ID is not. Does not work on wet hair, head half in the pillow, etc. Otherwise, of course, it is a sensational phone with great camera and mega display.
6158	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	Perfect Boy	5	Best iPhone ever	2019-01-27	de	Apple"" - Name is enough. I am in love with my new iPhone XS, totally satisfied. I bought on Christmas Time. So I got an amazing discount on it. Best iPhone ever, but a little more heavy than expected. Delivery time of Amazon is also good during Holidays.
6159	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Myron Bolitar	5	Top work machine	2019-05-17	de	What should I say that has not already been said. I bought it because of the larger display and good camera. The sensor of the camera should be 30% larger. Pictures are great, especially those that come directly from the Kemera, was important to me. Portrait works as it should, clearly there are here and there wrong representations on the edge of the glasses or hair, but I think it was the best iPhone could deliver. But I'm also on the high level here, as I'm a hobby photographer. Otherwise, it keeps what it promises and I'm thrilled.
6160	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	Krümel Monster	5	Super !	2018-12-11	de	Great phone! The camera is awesome, the sound of the iPhone is great! I had before the iPhone 7 and I have to say the conversion without a home button, I did not think bad, the Face ID detects even if the light is off or scarf and hood. The only negative thing that bothers me a bit is that it is a little harder as other phones. Since I'll buy such a bobbl for my phone so my fingers do not suffer when I hold the phone in my hand. Everything else great !!

6165	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Taimoor Aslam	5	Loved It	2019-03-26	de	Finally, my first ever iPhone. I always wished to have one but the crazy prices of these iPhones never justified to get one. This year I couldn't refrain myself because this gorgeous, bloody, future proof iPhone XS forced me to spend this hefty amount at last. Its a luxury device with unmatched performance and I'm sure I'd never switch back. It's way much pricy, to be honest, I'll never recommend buying unless you're a die heart fan of this beast(like me) but I promise you'll never regret your purchase(aside from money).
6166	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	js	5	The best iPhone - YES! (at least until next)	2018-12-22	de	There are already countless reports and tests, but I would like to address two points. For some time, the missing home button and face ID has stopped me from buying. After only a few days, I definitely do not miss the home button. The operation of the iPhone succeeds without as simple and supple, as it is used by Apple.Face-ID works so fast and accurate, that one immediately asks how it could only withstand as long as with the fingerprint sensor.

6213	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	Marc / Arpexia	5	Apple's newest battleship!	2018-10-30	de	Hello dear Amazonler! Today I review the iPhone XS in the 256 GB version in black / space gray. I have received it because of my upcoming contract extension. Before I used an iPhone 7 Plus 128 GB in black / space gray. I could have already extended my contract at that time, when the iPhone 8 or X came out. But since I had the iPhone 7 Plus and I had the added value of upgrading to the iPhone 8 was missing, and I was with the technique of the iPhone X (Face ID) is not 100% convinced it was initially in a pure tariff extension with a smaller Laufzeit.Als but I was increasingly confronted with the iPhone X (family, friends, etc. ) I was once curious how the technology works behind it and I finally decided to renew with the iPhone XS. Now to the device, the device is slightly smaller than my iPhone 7 Plus, but has just more "" Netto "" -Bildschirmfläche. For my taste, just the right size now, since the iPhone 7 Plus is always "" big "" but not "too big", but was somehow unwieldy, hard to describe (and I already have very big hands !). The device itself comes, as you know, WITHOUT homebutton. What was the most incomprehensible in the world for me, because how else to serve the device? And how sophisticated is the Face-ID story? I was quickly taught a better one. The device itself can be used excellently (!!!) without homebutton. Just when I attached one of the SPIGEN armored glass foils, I realized that even without the recess at the bottom of the home button, there is much less potential for dirt. Furthermore, you will notice that much is explained during the initial setup, like the device "" now "" is to use and much on the respective gestures is received.Thus, Face-ID is established relatively quickly and this works very well. The unlock is fast and with a wipe you are on the homescreen. The handy feature of Face-ID is that it is already compatible with many apps and you save the annoying password after the one-time password and approval for using the Face-ID then just - I think that's really great, because it is so much easier and faster to his Apps / Login kommt.Face-ID also works in the "" extreme test "" yet. With sunglasses it has unlocked 3 / 5x, with "" fake beard "" always 5/5 times (I think here then the eyes are scanned or something). So the technology behind it really recognizes striking aspects and balances them systematically. The new gestures include, among other things, a swipe down to pull the upper part of the screen "down" (but must be set ---> activate one-handed operation) Swipe from the bottom to the top and then to the page to get to (and close) the apps you've opened. Holding down the "" off "" button for a few seconds to activate Siri, as well as simultaneously pressing the "" Louder "" and "Off" button for a screenshot. Homebutton itself to homebutton "" has taken me 1 hour (to learn the gestures) so it is very user-friendly I think.Etwas a pity, however, I find it, that the time, W-Lan / Internet / provider and battery above the percentage battery level is no longer displayed unless you are charging the device actively, or wiping down from above (at the battery) to display the widget menu. For the battery, my iPhone 7 Plus had a battery of 89% after 2 years of use, so actually always super well maintained. The battery of my XS here lasts longer than I'm used to from my 7 Plus (if I remember the early days back). To the display, the camera and the A12 chip, I can not say much, there you should on the Apple Page also make smart times. I think only that the display is still a whole corner sharper and the colors are much richer, the camera has really "NEN" whole bunch "" learned "" and you will of course notice the faster chip. I am myself after 2 weeks of use more than satisfied ! The switch from the iPhone 7 Plus to the iPhone XS was definitely worth it! Whether I would switch however from the iPhone X on the iPhone XS, I could not directly affirm, since the "" innovations "" are presumably too small and Apple calls naturally also juicy prices (whereby the price does not flow into my evaluation, since this yes is known).
6214	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Amazon Kunde	3	Luxury mobile phone with luxury problem	2018-11-02	de	All in all, a super noble smartphone, exactly what I always wanted. Especially in gold a beautiful all-rounder with a decisive weak point, the incredibly weak battery. Sure he keeps on a good day at low or not too demanding use, but then it comes to the slightly more frequent use alone with Facebook or Instagramm, then tumble the percentages in flight. Who is not too bad times to tow a power bank, I can recommend otherwise this smartphone otherwise warmth. To all thoroughbred Mobilezocker ... look for something else!

6216	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Claus	5	Switch from Android to IOS.	2018-11-22	de	I have only used Android and a Windows Smartphone so far. Especially the Samsung Galaxy devices have never disappointed me. As the last device before my new IPhone XS with 256gb I had a S9 Plus. But after a few months this became too big and unwieldy for me. Since I've always wanted to try out an iPhone, I decided to go to Saturn and buy one. Here came the first experience that showed me that at Apple is a lot different than the rest of the smartphone world. The seller told me to come back in 3-4 weeks so maybe they would have some in stock. I did not want to believe that but he was serious. After some back and forth, he found a back-laid device in which the financing was not achieved. So I could decide to take this golden 256gb device or drive back home. What should I say, I bought it. And here is my impression after a good 4 weeks: The gold I like after initial concerns very well and the workmanship is great. Thanks to its moderate size, the device fits perfectly in your hand and fits in any trouser pocket. The screen is still a good size and is one of the best I've ever had on a smartphone. The S9 Plus had very good speakers but those of the iPhone XS are even better. The camera is also excellent. When shooting against the light, she's the best I've ever had. The portrait shots are also great. The videos are great. Only in low light conditions was the camera of the S9 Plus a little better. I had to internalize the operating system first. That was not easy for an Android veteran. But after 4 weeks I can say that it is fun. Some things are better and some worse than Android. Top are definitely the speed and Face ID. I love it. A great feature that works great for me 100%. The battery was a positive surprise for me. I turn on my device at 6:30, then read about 1 hour of news and watch some YouTube. From about 8.00 clock I have it at work then in use. There I use the whole day calendar, OneNote, Todo lists, call 20 times and make 5 to 10 pictures. At about 16.30 I come home with about 70% battery. There is still some WhatsApp and about 1 to 1.5 hours of YouTube. Then the day comes to an end with about 50-60% battery for my iPhone XS. About the price I do not want to write much here, who puts the focus on it is certainly wrong with the iPhone XS wrong advice. Personally, I am glad to have risked the change. I can not yet conclusively assess the operating system, but in many ways it is similar to Android and basically faster. The iPhone XS belongs together with the Galaxy S9 Plus to the two best smartphones that I have owned so far. I can recommend it with the best conscience.
6217	iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Amazon Kunde	2	Sold after 2 weeks	2018-12-28	de	Info: bought in the media market in friedrichshafen / bodensee2 weeks of intensive useApple disappointed from year to year more.Display: I loved the true tone function in my i phone 8, in the XS, however, much too warm and yellowish! Even with display calibration can not even set in the beginning so that it has just as a nice display as my 8 -er. In Media Markt, where I bought my XS, I compared it to other XS and X models. All the same problem. When activated by True Tone yellowish. My 8-er, as I said, is natural and not yellowish at True Tone. Incidentally, the 7, 8 and even the new i phone xr model which all have a lcd and not this new oil panel as the x, and xs models, all have not the problem with yellowish displays. Apparently I am so highly praised oled technology to lie, because although they have a perfect black value, but in contrast to Apple's lcd panels have no perfect whiteness in (self-search on the Internet) Sound: wow !!! Very audible improvement for comparison with the 8-er. Note 1 They sound full, and have good bass in the meantime iOS operating system: in itself good performance, nothing jerks running apple typically fluid, update policy more than top !! If not meanwhile these many bugs since Ios 11 einschleicjen! Apple you must those prices that you demand, will be much better again! Battery life: very clear opinion - no! In a € 1350 expensive "toy" me to deliver a battery life, at a much larger battery than the built in my i phone 8, then brings a soooo short battery life with it! No! My 8-er yes the small mind you and not the 8plus model, had in my very intensive use a battery life of 1-1 one-and-a-half days. The 1350 ¬ expensive XS model with significantly larger battery already had in the early days already so 25-28% !! Grade 6 Conclusion: I have it unfortunately to an almost 500 ¬ loss at rebuy buy and I will buy in spring / March 2019 a i phone XR, which (even convinced in the media market) win beautiful lcd panel with natural-looking colors, no yellowing gets when reue rone is activated, and in contrast to the XS model is not only much cheaper but also loud tests, you can also read the internet, has a much longer battery life than the XS models, even better than the xS ma x model and the X model from the previous year! Thank you for your time of reading, it is honest words of a normal working man, neither a so-called apple moch android "younger"
6218	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	XXX	5	Best overall package	2019-03-21	de	I have had all the phones that are new. S10, Mi 9, S9, Mate 20 Pro, etc. None of the above delivers such a complete package from like the XS.Differieren you have here the user behavior. I phone a lot, need it for work to eg. Scan documents, take lots of photos and videos (children), lots of music for sports etc. None of the above can deliver a complete package which is consistent in itself. As an example one would like to send documents by mail. Scan by note at the XS, edit and away. Mate requires 3 providers Apps.Was also very good is the privacy. I always feel my data is secure and apps only know what they are allowed to know. This also confirms current procedures in the States. Another point is the battery. Actually, this is considered bad, but I see it differently. With the capacity of the XS and that is partially 50% less, it keeps still good. The question is how long the XS eg. with a 4100 mh battery would die.Die camera, I have seen some better, but definitely not for videos. Unfortunately, Weitwinkel is still missing. Overall, but very suitable for everyday use for family sports and business
6219	iPhone XS	64GB	Argent 	HoKe	5	Excellent smartphone ...	2018-10-31	de	Hereby I would like to get rid of a few sentences about the iPhone XS after three weeks of use. XS ... Outstanding design combined with the usual high-quality workmanship. It feels good in the hand, feels good and can be operated with one hand. Optics and feel are right. The OLED display shows content razor-sharp and natural. The usability leaves nothing to be desired, everything runs very smoothly and intuitively, the A12 chip and iOS set the bar very high. Thanks to regular updates and outstanding performance, not much will change, iPhones are just going ... The camera is the highlight of the XS for me, the portrait mode is the highlight. So many pictures in such a short time I have never shot with a smartphone and the enthusiasm does not decrease. It is the best camera that has ever been installed in an iPhone. A little criticism, I would like to get rid of it anyway. The battery could have more capacity and the price is too high, actually as always ...
6220	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Keine gekaufte Meinung.	1	What a disappointment	2018-12-20	de	After the drama with the iPhone X and their display problem, I wanted to give the newer version again a chance. To put it briefly, better take an older model which also works. Apps are mostly not optimized for the screen. iPhone crashes again and again. In the middle of phoning for example. Face ID did not work after the 2nd week, not a new configuration was not possible, more possible because the iPhone did not even recognize the face. Furthermore, the keyboard was displayed in the home screen although no input was required. Calls were superimposed on the home screen. Taking off was not possible. In these cases, only a deliberate restart of the iPhone helped. In this price category just a no-go. And I know iPhones since the 2nd generation (pictures will follow)
6221	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	ChaosLeopard	5	Revolution of the iPhone!	2019-03-04	de	Hello, this is already my third review on the iPhone. I've been there since the iPhone 3GS and have never been disappointed with Apple's iPhone history. The following does not refer to the purchase of the iPhone from Amazon. I bought the device in the Apple Store. Thus, I would like to describe my personal experiences with this review (as well as the predecessors) and help others in their decision to buy or change the new iPhone. Packaging / ContentWhen usual, Apple also packs the iPhone XS really excellent. Even at the first sight, the iphone attracts attention with its successful design. In addition to the iPhone XS is still in the packaging of the user manual for the device, the SIM card tool to open the slot on the iPhone and Apple Sticker. Furthermore, a USB to Lightning cable with the corresponding power adapter, which unfortunately continues to be 5Watt and of course the headphones with Lightning connector. What is missing is the adapter from Lightning to 3.5mm jack, this is no longer included with the iPhone XS, which I find very pity, as I continue to use headphones that work with 3.5mm blade and I have to reorder the adapter at Apple , Also, I think it's a great pity that Apple does not attach a larger power plug. The devices charge incredibly long (3 - 4 hours), which really annoying in the long run very annoying. The AirPower for wireless charging is still not available, which one must forego for the time being, although the new iPhones (from the 8 model) support the fast charging function. Here you have to resort to external accessories and spend money to use these new features. I do not expect Apple to settle for the AirPower, but at least a power supply of 20Watt like the iPad should be in there today. All in all, a nice package with some (if not even) annoying smears on the accessories concerns. Packing = Satisfactory-iPhone / DesignThe device really looks class. Have bought the 64GB model in gold and can only say: What a feast for the eyes! The most beautiful iPhone, which I have held so far in my hands. It really impresses and seduces to use. It was set this time on stainless steel instead of aluminum, which makes the iPhone look even higher quality. Whoever holds it in their hands will never want to let it go again. In addition to the volume keys and the power button, the home button has not been used since the iPhone X. By swiping from the bottom of the screen to the top you can now leave an application and get to the homescreen. If you think that this annoys and hampers the operation, I can anticipate the worries: After 1 day I got used to the swipe gestures and it is even more fun than using the predecessor (iPhone 8). Works really perfectly. In addition, at the top of the display there is a notch where a camera has been installed for FaceTime and the sensors, especially FaceID - which I will come across later. Looks really chic. Design is absolutely great !! (Very good) -DisplayWe come to the display. The iPhone XS has a super retina display with a diagonal of 5.8 inches and a resolution of 2436 x 1125 (slightly above FULL HD). Since I come from an iPhone 7 Plus, I have additionally got an OLED display, which leaves again stronger and richer colors. It's a great display. The size of (only) 5.8 inches, the device is also very good in the hand.It has become (really minimal) heavier, but this is not noticeable in everyday life. By far the best display, what I have seen in an iPhone. GREAT!!! (Very good) -KameraAuch the camera has improved compared to its predecessor. Even the smallest model has a camera with two lenses. These are even better and have an even better quality, especially at night. That really stands out and makes impressive pictures. For amateur photographers it is definitely an excellent camera. Since I do not shoot so many pictures, I can not say much about it except what I wrote above. Also the front camera is very good. She can now create portraits (like the front camera), and the Bookeh effect also makes it easy to edit and configure selfies through the blur filter. Of course that's very good for Selfiefans. Have tried it and can really recommend it, but I rarely do it to do it! Camera = Very good !! - PerformanceIt Apple X12 bionic chips with an Apple A12 (I'm not sure anymore) 6 cores and 4GB of memory , The device is incredibly fast and reacts really fast. Have not experienced any stuttering or crashes and hope that stays that way. The performance is generally very good, especially with iOS 12, where again was screwed to the hardware, especially in older devices. Everyone will be satisfied for a very long time. Performance = Very good! Speakers are quite good. Have not noticed a big difference to the iPhone 7 Plus. The sound provides a good bass and good acoustics and can be heard quite well. It is a pity that the 3.5mm blade connector was removed, because then I could try my headphones. Remedy is really only an adapter, which is not included. The sound is generally in order! (Good) operating system / iOS 12On the iPhone XS / XS MAX and Xr iOS 12 is installed by default. For me, it was the version iOS 12.1.2, so an update to iOS 12.1.4 is required. Run as already mentioned all top with the new chip and memory. As indicated above, there is a new feature (at least for those who have switched from iPhone 8 or older) called "FaceID". FaceID is a function that is used to unlock the device by means of face recognition. And that's quite simple in principle: the configuration prompts the user to roll his face once so that the face is recognized by the system. If the system has recognized the face, all you have to do is pick up the phone and wait for a few milliseconds, and it will unlock itself. It works perfectly.I always wear 2 glasses privately, and even then my face was recognized, even in the dark or when I'm getting ready for outdoor - hochgegelte hair, other glasses, etc. all no problem. Facilitates the operation a little and is also great fun. FaceID works very well with iOS 12 and is quite impressive. This should not cause any problems. Even in the App Store FaceID is quite good: If you buy, for example, an app or music, he checked before buying the face once and you can download the product. It is no longer required password. Really simple and very fast, you can not remember. If you want, you can switch off this function completely and access the usual password. Personally, I find it a nice feature. Along with it, the animojis (animated emojis), where emojis are brought to life through your face. A really nice gimmick, which is a lot of fun, if you write with someone and sometimes make some faces. IOS 12 is a successful system with good news and (almost) no mistakes, which makes the use even easier and faster through the optimization of the system. Those who love it will continue to love it.iOS 12 is thus "very good"! - BatteryThe battery has deteriorated somewhat in my opinion. With me are now 3 days instead of 2 days in it, which has me somewhat surprised.At that time, the iPhone 7 Plus, the battery has really lasted very long (to date), but the XS, it seems to me as if the battery life would be worse. Alone in one day I have lost 50%, although I have not really done too much with the device. Perhaps because of the new TrueTone (= function, which ensures that the display adapts to the environment and thus the manual configuration of the display settings is completely replaced and canceled), which significantly reduces the battery life. The battery has really disappointed me a bit, because I wish a little more juice in the device. Battery is unfortunately a total of "sufficient" "aus.-Preis- / VergleichdiskussionThe iPhone XS is available in the standard version (gold, silver black) in the 64GB version for 1149 €. That really was (even for my eyes) a lot of money; it hurt. One wonders of course: Is it really worth buying an iPhone XS or even XS MAX? It depends: If I have a device from the older years (iPhone 5S, 6, 6s, 7 or 8) I would say that a change is already a good jump, because you have the OLED display, a new operation through the display, which stretches to the entire device, FaceID, the performance and a new camera that really justify the price, BUT: Only if the old device is no longer fully functional. If you have not had an iPhone yet, I would advise you: save the money, buy the iPhone X, which is not that different from the successor, then you are well supplied for several years, otherwise the Xr, or wait until the iPhone XS is slightly reduced. The XS MAX I would access ONLY, if the larger display really appeals to you. A lot of battery gets her according to user reports not much out, so that's no reason to buy an XS MAX. € 1249 for an iPhone XS MAX is a lot of money. Otherwise I would wait and see what to say: I really want to use the new features and am very impatient, which should perhaps first consider whether he does not want an iPhone Xr. At first I was convinced that I switch to the XR, but then I have the OLED display, the double camera and especially the size more convinced of the XS, as the Xr, because the Xr was a block for me. The iPhone Xr has the same hardware as the XS (with some restrictions: no TouchID, a camera). If you think that you are buying an iPhone 5C, I have to say that this is not correct. In the 5C you had the old hardware installed, here at Xr you are really on the cutting edge of technology (except for the smears), which should really be enough for many out there.If you decide to buy the Xr, then: Take the XR in your hand and see if you can handle the size and weight. For me it was too big and heavy. Even the LCD display makes a solid impression on the Xr, please do not let the data on the paper affect you. Paper is patient, but whoever thinks he prefers to grab on the XS variants, see if you are not somewhere your old device (if any) sold on Ebay, so you would not have to pay so much , The exchange offer of Apple with the payment of the older device is worthwhile only if no one is really interested in your device or your device is damaged. Since you can easily calculate the value of the device and then this credit will be charged with the price of the new device. So I did it and came to 849 ¬, so in principle as much as the iPhone Xr. I switched from the iPhone 7 Plus with 128GB Space Gray to the iPhone XS Gold 64GB, worked out great. You can also set up your iPhone very comfortably in the Apple Store, then you will save the trouble at home! -> To memory: I changed from the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus to 64GB iPhone XS. Why? Because I used almost nothing. Of the 128GB, I felt 95GB free, not even a quarter, no matter how many photos I took or anything else. At that time, the iPhone 7 Plus was available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. 32GB seemed to me to be a little bit, especially with a plus model, so I decided for the 128GB version. Now the iPhone are now with 64GB memory to haben.Da again: Look how much you use in general. Who is now Poweruser, numerous albums etc.download, which should perhaps (if it is the iPhone XS) to grab 256GB model. 512GB is a memory for the one who is really on the phone every day for 18 hours and makes presentations, series, 100 movies, 1 million songs, 1 million photos, but there should also be enough of the 256GB variant because of the cloud, where the can store most of the data. 5GB cloud storage is available at the factory, who wants to upgrade to up to 2TB. Otherwise 64GB would have to be loose. I still have 48GB of the 64GB free and thus up for more. That's why: Think about it, look at your older devices, how much you have really occupied memory and then decide. As already mentioned: Look at the devices in the store. Decide then, what you like most, because the purchase is worthwhile in my opinion VERY, for that I would first waive the next years on a new one. Conclusion: The new iPhone XS is a really solid, but also an expensive smartphone. This is a lot of money, especially for new buyers. However, the functions promise what a user can expect and can be quite impressive. Owners who have an older iPhone worth the change in my opinion more, especially in contract renewals, because you have to pay one way or the other and you get away with the delivery of the older device again cheaper. New owners should really consider whether the price meets the expectations and wishes that they would like to invest for such a device. But whoever has one will love it: FaceID is a lot of fun, the device is very fast, the camera takes very good pictures and the general operation by wiping gestures with the new OLED display is a wonderful experience !! In this sense: Buy recommendation for owners older = Yes! For new customers = depends on the budget and the expectations. Otherwise = no, not necessarily. Best to wait a bit or to access the predecessor (iPhone X) or the new iPhone Xr. Hope I could bring some with my review some light in the dark and wish you much fun with the new iPhone XS! Yours sincerelyChaosLeopard
6222	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	1	Not convinced at all	2019-03-12	de	Never experienced such a jerky iPhone. Scrolling on text pages makes it no fun at all as it is almost constantly jerking and shaking. Who believes that would be an isolated incident, the Internet forums are full of complaints about this topic.

Good size and weight, top design. The only thing that bothers me is the camera which is very clear. Otherwise the camera is great, so I am always doing my YouTube videos (channel: Bastimilio) where I will review various products. Great video stabilization. Who has an iPhone X, should not change, by the way. Anyone with an iPhone 8 or older could think it over!
6224	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	Oliver Schlatter	5	Terrific.	2019-02-12	de	The iPhone Xs is a fantastic phone - optical (subjective), haptic (subjective) and technical (almost objective). The display is terrific and practical large, the usability very good and the omission of the home button is more blessing, because load. The gesture control (from the lower edge of the screen to highlight) already had Blackberry, and then that was already good to handle. Face-ID works fine for the most part - unless a dark pair of sunglasses is worn or a cap is pulled deep into the forehead; I would not have expected that. Only a small downside mixes in: after a few weeks, the battery capacity has already fallen to 98%. Although not an Apple fanboy, I'm still impressed with this phone. Case / case is the way mandatory ... Only the price is a joke, without question.

This is very annoying in the price category. The device is used in the original case. All my iPhones were always treated very carefully, so that they still looked very good after several years. The camera is great. The processing speed is also good, as usual. Face-ID responds, even in low light conditions.Bin for years iPhone user. Have skipped a few generations and decided now for the XS. Only the build quality of the stainless steel frame bothers me. Here I would have had nothing against aluminum. Next time I would rather opt for the space gray variant, in the hope that this less visible scratches shows. The device was purchased through a contract extension.

Battery life possible to live long: location, background services, push etc. everything that helps disabled or reduced to the minimum. If I still want to use the cell in the evening lead the way on the charger is not over, that was different in the X, too bad! This is the first time I've resorted to an S upgrade and I would be very disappointed ... I've already thought about selling the XS and switching to an Xer ... but it probably boils down to me until the 11er iPhone downgrade the battery will accept

6232	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	Amazonien	4	iPhone XS - is it worth the change?	2018-10-14	de	For a better overview of the text, a small table of contents: ► 1. Introduction / Advance► 2. Scope of delivery / Accessories / Supplementary purchases► 3. First impression / processing► 4. Equipment / performance / user experience► 5. Prices / resale value / storage equipment► 6. Conclusion ------------------------------------------ ► 1. Introduction / IntroductionI have that iPhone XS not purchased through Amazon, but bought after the launch in September 2018 directly through my mobile network provider.This review refers to the iPhone XS, Space Gray, 256 GB.After the iPhone 6s, the iPhone XS is my second smartphone from Apple. In extended family are currently still the models iPhone 8 plus and the iPhone SE used, so that here direct comparisons is well possible. The review does not want to open discussions or continue (for example: Android vs. iOS). The decision for or against a particular system has to be made by yourself at the end and is made out of many, mostly very different, aspects. However, based on my very personal perspective, the following report should nevertheless (I hope) be fair, informative and helpful in deciding if this iPhone might be for you.► 2. Scope of Delivery / Accessories / Supplementary PurchasesThe iPhone comes in the for Apple usual cardboard packaging with the noble design appearance therefore. The box contains: - iPhone XS; - USB-on-Lighning cable (data / charging cable); - Power adapter (USB charging adapter); - Apple EarPods (headphones with Lightning connector); - Short instruction manual / sticker / SIM tool; => NO adapter Lightning on audio jack anymore; The delivery does not offer any surprises. As with the iPhone predecessors, this is very spartan. The enclosed power supply (5 volts, 1 ampere) does not live up to the possibilities of the XS and still does not support fast charging technology. Optionally, stronger power supplies or wireless charging pads (Qi standard) can be obtained from other sources. Why Apple here attaches no charger, which moves on the state of the art, opens to me nicht.Als small addition, I just count here my supplementary purchases: - USB charger, 24Watt, 2 ports of anchor; - Case / back cover Aramid fiber from Pitaka; - Felt cover for iPhone XS with back cover by Almwild.► 3. First impression / processingNaturally, the "externals" are given more attention at the first impression. The design of the iPhone XS has not changed (apart from the slightly changed speaker openings and the changed antenna strips) compared to the iPhone X of the previous year.The measurements for height, width and depth (143.6mm x 70.9mm x 7.7mm) have remained identical to the predecessor model, the iPhone X. The grandeur of the camera lens / sensors has increased to 1.5mm. The weight has increased slightly by 3g from 174g to 177g. The frame of the iPhone XS is made of stainless steel and both front and back are made of a special glass. In addition to the black (Space Gray) and silver version is now, and this is new, a golden version available. The iPhone XS is, as usual Apple, processed a very high quality. I could find no material defects, unusual gaps or the like. With twisting attempts is the iPhone XS and nothing to hear is synonymous nothing. The smartphone is simply good in the hand and is not too heavy. The material appearance and appearance is very high quality and looks very noble. Also, the attached accessories is very well made and offers no opportunity for criticism. What I do not like aesthetically on the new iPhone is the display Notch (recess for camera and sensors on the upper edge of the display). I hope that another alternative will be found in future versions. 4. Furnishings / Performance / User Experience Every iPhone owner knows how easy it is to set up the device. In a few steps, you will be guided through the facility and can thus perform this quickly and without problems. It is recommended that one creates a backup of his old iPhone via iTunes so at the end of the Einrichtungsprozesses the new iPhone from the old backup of the old device wieder.Bei existing concerns about the iTunes software can create a backup without problems via iCloud , whereby then the creation of the backup and the import of the backup over the domestic WLAN runs. Thus, you get a new iPhone including all apps, settings, contacts, scores, etc. of the old iPhone. Before setting up, it is advisable to have the following things / information ready: own Apple ID with password; Password of the domestic Wi-Fi network. The XS and its user interface are very sleek-fast and without any jerks. All animations and apps run smoothly. I could not detect any weaknesses in the hardware equipment here. Incidentally come in the iPhone XS for the first time 4GB RAM memory used. The X was 3GB.For the user experience I can say that it was unfamiliar to me compared to the iPhone 6s to have no homebutton anymore. A simple wipe gesture replaces the homebutton. Within a very short time, however, the habit has been established here and the missing homebutton represents absolutely no limitation in the operation dar. Battery In the case of the battery, Apple is in terms of capacity, on a lithium-ion battery with slightly nominal worse values ​​compared to its predecessor: (new: 10.13 Wh, 2658 mAh, previously 10.35 Wh, 2716 mAh). By the way, the battery was pre-charged to approx. 65% by default. Telephone functions / sound / loudspeaker The telephone characteristics compared to my previous iPhone 6s are clearly improved. The speaker in the outer ear transmits the sound much clearer. The voice quality is very good and produces a clear reproduction. The speaker works well too. The quality and dynamics of the sound of the two mounted on the bottom of the device speaker falls to me compared to the iPhone 6s also very positive. Especially I am looking forward to the opportunity to use a second SIM card. In addition to the physical SIM card in nano format, a second digital SIM card can be used (not physically as a second SIM compartment, but electronically via a so-called eSIM). However, the function is not yet available and should be unlocked with one of the upcoming updates werden.Im comparison to the iPhone 6S makes the XS worlds better photos. According to many reviews, the photo quality has improved thanks to improved aperture parameters and an increased dynamic range of the two dual cameras compared to the X.► 5. Prices / Resale value / memory equipmentApart from my criticism under item 2 (delivery), I see at the latest iPhone at the prices quoted my main criticism. Here, Apple has retained compared to the previous model with the same memory equipment (€ 1,149.00), I feel the price but too high. The high price relativized taking into account the possible long usage time, the long software update cycles and the high resale value something.Offizielle Apple prices of the iPhone XS at launch: 64GB = 1.149,00 € 256 GB = 1.319,00 € 512 GB = 1.549,00 € Resale value Also from my own experience, I can report that to be achieved resale prices of used iPhones or iPads (whether the known Online auction house, classifieds portals or companies which buy used electronics) are enormously high.If you want, you can order here with a selling price minus a discount of just approx. 150 € to 250.00 from the purchase price - (depending on condition) after the first year count. With the proceeds from the sale of the old iPhone you can then the financing of the new device a little Schönrechnen.► 6. ConclusionShort and concise: visually the new iPhone looks like the previous one. Point. As usual with the last iPhone "S" vintages Apple relies on an optimizing finetuning of its new flagship and an evolutionary as well as ambitious model-Pflege.Herausrage thereby the improved memory, the optimized camera and the more efficient chip. Therefore, one should be with the present iPhone for some time on the safe side. The iPhone is processed as usual high quality and has a sophisticated look and appearance. Apple remains true to its philosophy. An eco-system of hardware and software that tends to foreclose. The reasons for this are manifold: economic, security reasons, focus the user experience only on the pure use. Depending on the usage claim and the perspective, this can have advantages as well. Anyone who has been considering the purchase of an iPhone for years now will be getting one of the best smartphones in the house with the new iPhone XS. Who comes from the 6th, or the 6s or the iPhone 7, for the change is worth in any case. Who has an iPhone X from last year, for the conversion is not really worth ... My main criticism, the pricing policy of Apple and the Spartan and not performance-compliant delivery (undersized power supply) cloud my positive overall impression. That's why the point deduction to 4 stars. Regardless: I certainly like the iPhone from my everyday life no longer think away .--------------------------- ------------------------------- ConclusionThe report reflects my subjective opinion and personal impression. I hope the text is still fair and was helpful and useful for one or the other.
6233	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Friesenjung	3	Comparison between iPhone Xs, Xs Max and Xr	2018-11-24	de	For many, the question is whether you have to resort to the iPhone flagship Xs or Xs Max, or whether you can not live well with the at least 300 EUR "cheaper" Xr well. Therefore, now a compact comparison between the two devices. Price: The Xr has an MSRP of 849 EUR in the 64 GB version, the Xs of 1149 EUR and the Xs Max of 1249 EUR. With the Xs Max the price can be increased by a bigger memory up to an insane 1649 EUR. Processing and haptics: The Xr lies technically exactly between the Xs and the Xs Max. The optimal size is of course always a matter of taste - best the devices once even in take the hand. All three devices have a glass back. The Xs models are available in 3 colors, the Xr even in 6 colors. The frame of the Xs devices is made of polished stainless steel, while the Xr uses matt aluminum. Stainless steel looks higher quality, but is also more susceptible to scratches. The Xs models have thinner display edges than the Xr and look a bit more modern. However, whoever from an iPhone 7, the look of the Xr will probably still inspire. The Xr is also slightly thicker than the Xs devices (Xr: 8.3mm, Xs: 7.7mm, Xs Max: 7.9mm). Basically, all devices are very well processed.Display: Here we come (next to the price) to the biggest difference of the devices. The Xr has a 6.1 inch IPS panel with 326 ppi, the Xs a 5.8 inch OLED with 458 ppi and the Xs Max a 6.5 inch OLED with likewise 458 ppi. In direct comparison, the lower sharpness of the Xr display is recognizable - in everyday life, the difference is less strong than one would expect based on the numbers. Also with the color representation, the contrasts, black values ​​and the brightness the OLED panels are better. But that does not mean that the Xr display is bad. It's best to go to an Apple store and look at the devices one at a time - you'll probably be surprised. Incidentally, the Notch has an identical size for all devices.Performance: All devices have the same A12 processor installed. The Xr has 3 GB Ram, the Xs 4 GB Ram. They all run on iOS 12, so they get great performance without noticeable differences. The software with gesture control works great. The Xr has in contrast to the Xs no 3D touch. The Xr is up to 256 GB of memory, the Xs models up to 512 GB.The memory is not expandable as always with Apple.Kamera those are almost identical. Each with a 7 MP front camera with f / 2.2 and a main camera with 12 MP and f / 1.8. The Xr lacks the second telephoto lens of the Xs devices (2x optical zoom). This gives it a bit more options in portrait mode than the Xr. Otherwise, everything is the same, so good image sharpness, good color fastness and dynamics. The low-light performance is OK (but the Huawei P20 Pro or Mate 20 Pro but much better), great videos with 4k and 60 fps.Akku The Xs Max has installed with 3174 mAh the largest battery. This is followed by the Xr (2942 mAh) and then the Xs (2568 mAh). In practice, however, the Xr has the best battery life. With approximately 7.5 hours of display-on-time, most users will arrive for 1.5 days without reloading. The Xs Max comes to 6.5 hours and the Xs only to 4.5-5 hours. This can make a day without reloading ever close.Additional features: No differences. All offer wireless charging, stereo speakers, face-ID (fast, reliable and relatively secure), practical mute switch, IP certification (XR only IP67). Fast loading is synonymous, but Apple does not pack the right power supply in the box. Likewise, one of the jack connection adapter is missing. Conclusion: Dual Sim is synonymous only with eSIM. Conclusion: For Apple products you always pay a hefty surcharge; who accepts that gets better price performance on the Xr than the Xs. The iPhone Xr offers for 300-400 euros less many things in common with the siblings. So the processor is at least very similar to the Xs and camera, design and additional features. The biggest difference lies in the display (in particular the resolution). On the other hand, the Xr offers a much better battery life. So if you want an iPhone, gets the Xr with the best price-performance ratio in the current Apple iPhone cosmos. For the best display you have to grab the Xs. For me, this results in a total of 3 stars for the Xs and Xs Max, as well as 4 stars for the Xr. My personal Amazon rating matrix: * missed expectations in all respects; ** missed on some points; *** Expectations met; **** exceeded expectations in some points; ***** Exceeded expectations in all points should this review have been helpful, I would be very happy about a click on the "Useful" button!
6234	iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	fraeulein_a.	1	Caution - keep your fingers away!	2018-12-27	de	Contents of the pack and information on the package do not match! I paid extra to make sure that I did not buy the iPhone from a third party, but paid attention to "selling and shipping through Amazon". On the box was a completely different serial number to see, as in the device. I had bought the phone in gold, the serial number of the device showed after checking the Internet on a silver model. The device was also already in use, when I turned it on nothing had to be set up and it was directly the home screen with apps to see. Even after reset to factory settings (in the process was funny to see the Android icon) I could not log in as usual from Apple step by step. I have sent it back right now. Stay away from this device and buy directly from Apple.
6235	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Sommerchen	5	Great device	2018-10-20	de	I have the iPhone XS since the first day of publication. Before I had the iPhone 7 Plus (which still had a battery capacity of 91% after 2 years!) It was for the first time very unusual for me. At first I was very tired of the homebutton, but after a few days I had changed my habit. Also, the back is no longer dull, but reflective, was forgotten after a few days. Stunning white you never see great fingerprints. Of course this is clearly positive! What I find awesome is the color. The gold has something ... special in itself. It is not typical gold. The reflection is always dipped in a red-orange, which just looks great. The border is normal gold-colored, the narrow display border black - which was also a getting used to, because I was used to the bright, friendly white-gold design. What I noticed pretty quickly, is that it has a better speaker. Whether playing games or talking on the phone, you can really make the volume very loud - without audible loss of quality. The Notch is there, yes, but I do not bother with its disreputable size. Before there was completely border, therefore ... Weight and overall size are different to the iPhone 7 Plus, but was not noticeable to me. Only when I held both devices in the hand, I was much on it. In the pants or jacket pocket but I had no problems even with the 7 Plus. The camera is great, as before. I can not see much improvement in the sensors, but in particular praise the focus in detail. Sound, graphics, and performance are outstanding. But here, too, I had no problems with the iPhone7 Plus. Zero stuttering and not once is it smeared me. The battery holds in my opinion, with active use significantly longer than the old device. Standby seems to me the same, as well as the charging time with the standard cable. Face ID works for me to 99%, even if I do not look focused on the device, but turn the head sideways. If it does not work, which is very rare, or if I lie on my stomach in bed, then I just enter the code. Well, what else should I say ... I'm satisfied, the workmanship is excellent, I have clean nothing to complain about. The price is high, of course, but you know that before and you get extremely good quality! Also the service is correct, which I had to use occasionally in the past years (AppleID forgot password, reclaimed a device (Could Apple ultimately nothing)). Here you can see clearly, where a large part of the money goes, because at no other company I have experienced so good service! Where I can understand grunts, is the standard cable, if yes fast-charge is possible. Because Apple saves in the wrong place.
6236	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	Coskun AyYildiz	2	IPHONE XS PROBLEME	2019-01-22	de	I have purchased the product from Amazon.de. Delivery was fast and faultless as used by Amazon. The device set up as a new device, for the first time I was positive überarscht, but then came the evil Überarschung the Iphone is simply a restart had erwuzingen with loud + quiet button and then power button, then it is a while then the same problem again the status bar disappears repeatedly and when I call often I have failed call Apple contacted I should reset the device. Said done no improvement. Have now taken contact with Amazon let's see how it will continue now. For the price the problems should not be present. Update 23.1.19 Today Amazon received a replacement device as always Top shipping and lightning fast. When I unpacked the phone, I've made a nasty surprise the phone has a quirk below or is broken off the top and on the side also add the pictures to Amazon contacted and again ordered replacement hopefully the smooth.
6237	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	MRG	1	Volume knob broken at the factory	2019-01-13	de	After I had decided to spend 1220 EUR for an iPhone XS Silver, I was looking forward to the new device. Recently, I had an iPhone SE. The device makes a good visual impression, but turned out quickly that the joy will be short lived. Because the device was delivered from the factory with a broken volume knob. So if I'm currently unintentionally adjusting the volume for music or calls, there's no way to fix it. Apple has suggested sending the device and sending it back in 10 days. They would even pick it up. Alternatively, I'm allowed one day to go from Apple's election to a store and talk to a technician there. However, only at 10 o'clock in the morning. Sure, "who else is working if he can buy an iPhone for 1220", is probably the logic. I'm terribly disappointed with Apple. Only good that I ordered from Amazon: get in 2 days a replacement device and then only have to move everything again, but always have a device available.
6238	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Jessica	5	Apple iphone XS	2019-03-05	de	Despite the reviews it was a fake, another cell phone etc, I ordered it because it was 100 ¬ cheaper than directly at Apple. I came to the original Iphone XS in gold, as ordered. Original boxed and with original accessories. Had previously the Iphone 6 and can therefore only recommend it, of the image quality, the resolution of course, the larger storage .... It should be well considered for this price and I hope it lasts as long as my old one ....
6239	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Bianchi	3	Abandonable compared to 6S	2018-11-21	de	The omission of the HomeButton is positive. I do not like the glass back and I think it is too strong. With the new operating system 12.1 some important APPs are no longer usable. The jump from 64 to 256 GB is too big and incomprehensible to me. The transmission of data from 6S to XS is included as a puzzle, which I feel as pure arrogance. I can not recognize a justification for the high price.
6240	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	Malabulaba	1	Excessively overrated product with many disadvantages	2019-01-04	de	For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Use only if the phone with the display is up on the table Warranty / Guarantee: The iPhone XS is indeed high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Apple gives on its products generally only 12 months Manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the price policy actually almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone from the top My rating of one star refers exclusively to the criticisms mentioned above.Note: Factual comments I am willing to answer, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and not with criticism to be able to deal with! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.
6241	iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Junica Talukder	4	Apple's most expensive toy	2019-01-04	de	In itself, the order and shipping was absolutely great. Point deduction is rather Apple, since the price of the new model is absolutely incredible ... but if people buy it then (and oh yes I owe me guilty), it benefits them just. In general, I love the camera, the screen and the usual Apple design (both inside and out). Despite the price, I am and remain an Apple Confessor

What has bothered me is that, When apps are downloaded, you have to press power button twice each time, on a modern device that everything is touchable.
6254	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Alex	3	Dear to stay with the 8 ..	2019-05-17	de	On the whole, I can not recommend the XS. Personally found the 8er more comfortable to use or in the hand. Even the camera was generally better, except that it had no bokeh due to a camera lens. Where the XR also creates one. Face ID not mine at all. Who likes it ok. With fingers I find it much more pleasant. From the price you need not even start. Let's see what Apple skin out in September again. As long as the iPhone SE remains as the 2nd device and the Huawei P30. 2.5 to 3 stars more but not synonymous.
6255	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Gray	Kunde Arno	5	Nice and good	2018-12-10	de	I decided despite the price for the silver XS with 256 GB and did not regret it. Come from Android and can only notice improvements. The reception is, even in rural areas, without complaints. Strangely enough, although one initially heard the contrary, it is even better than with my Galaxy. The battery lasts for me full two days. Camera is above reproach and with the professional iOS apps, this can be further upgraded, so that even long low-light footage a la Mate 20 Pro are possible. A good investment that will hopefully be sustainable due to Apple's longer updates.
6256	iPhone XS	256GB	Argent 	ML	1	New iPhone defective - problems with the battery charge	2019-04-07	de	Premium Price - Premium Product? Unfortunately no.My new iPhone XS 256GB, freshly unpacked, charges the battery only sporadically. The Lightning connection often has to be put in and out several times, it's just a matter of luck. Overnight, the battery was e.g. only about half charged and then the battery charge was interrupted with the Lightning charger plugged in. With another out and reinstecken it went on. For a smartphone beyond the 1000 € an imposition. I was with the device at the Apple dealer site, there the problem was also recognized. On-site software updates were performed, smartphone reset, restarted - nothing helps. It was offered to send the 2-day-old iPhone for repair - I refused and made use of the right of withdrawal. After a short googling that does not seem to be an isolated case.
6257	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Deko	1	Bad final inspection. Price / performance - not acceptable	2019-01-31	de	For over 1000 € so bad displays. I bought two Xs. One is good and the second has clear reddish up and to the right. This is very bad for so much money. Exchange is not my thing. Right side has a gap between the display and the case, which you can not only see, but the edge is therefore also sharp. The device is fast, fluid and good, but so poor final inspection for so much money ... No, I'm not satisfied! Only one star because of much too high price and bad final control. Today I have noticed that the power button can only print above and below it totally jammed. One device and three quirks.

The iPhone Xs, like all other iPhones before, fits perfectly into my Apple infrastructure and alone I love it. The device is perfectly processed, incredibly fast, durable and offers with this camera an insanely picture quality. All these factors combined with the stability of the value of the Apple products, it was reason enough for me. Those who enjoy these things will enjoy the device. I advise all others, which are impressed by pure achievement data of the androids, of the purchase. If you helped my honest review, I would be glad about a "" useful ""!

6272	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Jonas Gebhardt	4	Premium smartphone, whose advantage is dwindling	2019-07-13	de	If you want a smartphone without much thought and where the price is secondary, then the iPhone XS is the ideal smartphone. In particular, the ease of use and the design of iOS are a clear selling point. The connection of the services such as iCloud etc are also excellent as always, so that Apple is in terms of user-friendliness clearly in the first place and just in the business area hardly anyone can Apple the water. Since I just recently for a while the Samsung Galaxy S10 in use had, I must say, that the Smartphone from Samsung as pure hardware really the perhaps most beautiful iPhone in the market is and also the camera was again a whole piece better. For me, however, the operating system was ultimately the rash, although I for the change of iOS to Android was actually open.
6273	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	CarolinF.	1	IPhone XR, XS or XS Max?	2019-07-03	de	Hello people:) I think it's really good that you here so much reinschreiben:) I had considered to buy either the IPhone XR, IPhone XS or the iPhone XS Max .. I have until now the iPhone 8Plus! What is really great :), but I would rather another .. the newer, the better:) I have now read a lot of "bad" about the iPhone XR & I think, then I'll love the iPhone XS Max, IPhone XS I think that's out of the question, because the processing should not be so good and because it's smaller than my iphone 8Plus. And I love big phones! What would you recommend? Which of the 3's? Please only give some tips that have the respective IPhones :) that would help me the most !! I would buy the iPhone and not here in Germany, but in Switzerland:) To a lot of cheaper, of course, connects one then with a holiday :) or rather the other way round: Please ask for tips. (Ratings are not correct, because I have to enter something to write here)
6274	iPhone XS	64GB	Argent 	Sascha	5	Apple halt	2019-07-13	de	Great timeless design, Face ID super fast. I was a bit skeptical at first if Face ID would work as smoothly as Touch ID. It works better and I do not want to go back to Touch ID. The OLED display is also of high quality, very clear and very sharp. The iPhone fits well in the hand and I feel the weight just right. I do not know what else I should write, which is not found on YouTube in the different channels. If you are not sure, just look there before making a decision. Yes, the price is high. However, Apple provides 5-6 year updates for each device. That one does not have with Android devices just. Hardware and software are, as usual with Apple, coordinated and for years I miss any features.
6275	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Argent 	D.P.	5	Remarkable device	2018-10-08	de	The iphone XS Max replaces an iphone 8 plus for me. Even if the change was not necessary, I finally wanted to own a rimless iphone. Curiously, last year, when the iPhone X was released, a price of over € 1,000 for a smartphone seemed immoral to me. Where my morality is, I have unfortunately not found out.Fun by page. The iphoe XS Max is truly a first-rate device. The feel and the "high" weight make something easy. Compared to my previous iphone 8 plus, the display is a lot brighter and, due to the better resolution, even clearer. The speed is remarkable and noticeably faster than with an iphone X. The cameras, and I mean not only the front camera (keyword beautygate), are world class. I own quite petite (small) men's hands, nevertheless the iphone can be used without problems. Is such a device over 1400 EUR worth? Never consider sober. But from the point of view of enthusiasts anyway! I'm actually no apple fanboy, I own, except for a service ipad and no other apple devices. I already had several android devices (HTC, Samsung, Sony) and even a Windowsphone. But I always came back to apple. On the one hand, iOS is simply the most comfortable and clear operating system for me, on the other hand, I think the phones are just great processed. I can not call you an absolute reason for buying and also disapprove that these devices are so expensive. I consider the iphone a luxury item that just makes me happy.
6276	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	Marcel	1	Usury prizes for what Apple now gets the receipt	2018-12-03	de	It is a joke what Apple now calls for the iPhone! Not without reason, the sales go back significantly and I agree with the full! One think: There used to be the iPhone 8 and 8Plus for about 700 and 800 euros then came the X where many thought wooow a completely new premium iPhone for an extremely high premium price .... I bought it and must also say that I am completely disappointed with the processing ... I am an iPhone user of quasi first hour but that with a 1150 euro expensive smartphone on the back one side is sharp-edged than the other side (if one of the glass on the frame touches noticeable) is a NO GO! And now it is so the Apple again brings a Preiskracher and that XR the "cheap version" for the price that used to cost the premium model and for the normal model XS offers for over 1100 euros and the hammer! The big one for about 1200! Earlier IPhone 8 = 700 Euro model comparison XS = 1150 Euro8Plus = 800eueo XSMAX = 1200 Euro. As Apple has now finally overstepped the arc and this revenges itself now also on the basis of the new sales figures and that is completely deserved! Price so outrageously expensive then this will be my last iPhone sein.Und I have already heard of many people ... All the best with your usury strategy which slowly no longer rises what by the way applies to other Apple products. The competition is now at least equivalent and much much cheaper. Until then and goodbye Apple!
6277	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Argent 	Macinson	4	Great mobile for a sporty price	2018-11-13	de	First of all, I did not purchase the device from Amazon, but directly from the Apple Store. Now that I have skipped some devices since the iPhone 6, it was time to buy a new iPhone. My wife was still a user of an iPhone 7 Plus, but since I should now get a new device, we decided to exchange both phones. Basically, it was probably not the best moment, since the iPhones are priced since the X in new dimensions - but suspect I mean, that they will not be able to get there that fast any more. Nevertheless, go to the Apple Store to get a grip on the latest generation XS, XS Max and XR. Well, for someone who comes from the iPhone 6 or 7, this is of course a visual and tactile quantum leap. The display of all devices is really awesome, with the XR is minimal behind the top devices, since only these have an OLED display (when you look closely and depending on the content played you notice that). My wife despite IPad almost everything with your phone makes it clear that it must be the big version again, so it was an XS MAX in silver. The size and the existing "full screen" I think is really great (since the Xs Max is really an announcement) and makes my wife of course much more fun compared to the 7 Series. The "Notch" (the black bar on the top of the iPhone) really does not bother you at all (there are some critics here). After the device has been in use for a few days, you have to realize that you do not miss the missing homebutton for one second, because you got used to the new handling intuitively very quickly. Even Face-ID works absolutely easily and makes it easier to log in to various apps. The camera is also top and again a good step better than the iPhone X. Overall, the performance is excellent and all functions / apps run smoothly. The battery life itself can not say much because I was charged the phone every night. I will observe this in more detail and possibly write an update. Compared to my old iPhone, it is a little bigger and when you pick it up you immediately notice a slight weight difference (a bit heavier). Conclusion: Overall, Apple has once again launched a top-of-the-line phone, but what you get in the price category may also expect. The quality is outstanding and I hope it lasts the next few years, as we are planning to drop some models again. In spite of all the praise, I pull off a star, because I find that prices have really been exceeded in the meantime. I may not complain, as I too have paid this price, but I think that even in the range of 1000 € (or slightly lower) it should be able to market its top device I hope my personal and subjective assessment was helpful to be able to better assess the product.
6278	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Gold	Amazon Kunde	4	Not appropriate!	2018-11-08	de	Unbelievably good but unfortunately too cheap for an Iphone! If Apple reads this please contact us if you are ready to sell it for 5672 €.
6279	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Argent 	Happy	5	Switch from the iPhone 6 and I'm thrilled	2018-12-18	de	I have chosen the 256 GB version, because that quadruples my previous storage space. My iPhone 6 has accompanied me for four years. The switch to XS Max is a quantum leap! I was skeptical at first because of the Face ID, but it works flawlessly and is a real improvement to the Touch ID, which did not always work reliably. I do not miss the homebutton. Now you just wipe briefly from the bottom up. In terms of performance, I do not have to say much. I'm from the iPhone 6, clearly I'm thrilled! The price is plentiful, but what you get is just lush. I use my phone every day and if it is four years again, which I hope, then I am satisfied and can live with the price. No one is forced to buy the phone. Since I am a lot of outdoor people, I also like that it is finally waterproof. Since the iPhone 4s I only had iPhones, this one is my third and that - of course! - best ever. I would buy it again! As accessories, I have: - Urban Armor Gear Plasma Protective Case for Apple iPhone Xs Max OMOTON [3 Pieces] Protective film for iPhone XS Max [6.5 inch], bulletproof film with positioning aid, 9H hardness VANMASS Car Holder Car Wireless Charger Car Ventilation Car Cell Phone Holder 10W Qi Inductive Charging Station for Car NANAMI Fast Wireless Charger, Qi Charger for iPhone XS / XS Max / XR / X / 8/8 Plus, Wireless Inductive Charging Station
6280	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	Luka	2	Works, like all others and more just not.	2018-12-03	de	OK, all in all. I had a Huawei P20 Pro in direct comparison and I have to say that Huawei makes much better photos especially the front camera. What I really want to criticize is the price is by no means worth justifying the device's regular lags, the camera is no better than the Huawei devices. Quick charger must be purchased seprat. AUX adapter is not included. I will sell this smartphone again and get the Huawei P20 Pro. Because of the audacity of Apple nothing to do for his customers and because of the better price-performance ratio. Conclusion after 4 weeks: Face ID does not recognize my face, face can not be reconfigured ... I'm glad if the part is gone .. ,
6281	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	▂ ▃ ▅ ▆ L U K E ▆ ▅ ▃ ▂	1	Excessively overrated - Expensive is not perfect	2019-05-16	de	■ Purchased version:  iPhone XS Max • 256 GB ~ Space Gray ■ Hello everybody, I also want to briefly and briefly because much has already been written in advance, say a lot to what has annoyed me as an Apple Fan Boy animal. I did not buy it because of the price here on Amazon. I was very pleased with the new iPhone XS MAX. Purchased, and intensively tested here is my result in a compressed version. I was stressed above all because of the camera and battery! Much of the negative experiences I can underline here. My first impression: looks like a grown iPhone X out. And for the many money, of course, very chic and beautiful. Very noble, very good workmanship! • UNBOXING: Despite high-end price of proud 1600 € lacks u.a. a part of the iPhone X was still on board - also: no quick charger and no Qi charging pad. Impudence! So Apple has abruptly abolished wired jack headphones completely. If you want to have the adapter, you can pay a hefty 10 euros when you buy it directly from Apple.Otherwise, there is the usual stuff: a Lightning cable and a power adapter and ear pods with a Lightning connector. • PERFORMANCE: Apple's highly acclaimed performance did not really blow me away. Overall: way too slow, maybe a bit faster than my iPhone X (40% faster) .Apps also do not open faster. There is no leap forward. As far as surfing is concerned, I'll save it, it'll be silly with Safari. People who can see a little bit worse could get in trouble with it. What I found very funny though, was that despite the huge display many apps that did not exploit. Of all this, I especially liked the huge OLED display. Really first cream.BUY: Keep still in mind that this device costs 1600 €. • OPERATION: The operation altogether was not a problem for me personally. For people with small hands and newbies here are some problems with the operation before programmed. The screen diagonal could be too good for some: With the one-handed operation, as already written, not all areas of the display can easily be reached. • CAMERA: As a hobby photographer, I love to capture pictures in nature and sometimes at night Unfortunately, here some people are not 100% happy, they are silky, they take it that way! Honestly not better than my iPhone X..Why? The pictures are very natural! No question, BUT: compared to the high-end product from a well-known manufacturer, what my colleague, his pictures are much better. Because just in the low-light more light on his sensor zulässt.Und the automatic often disappears and creates The VIDEO camera! Very nice and supple shots. One should still keep in mind that this smartphone costs 1600 €. • FRONT CAMERA: The front camera can Why: Even here are selfies of the competition compared to a top model from Appleum far better, both at night and during the day. • AKK UDisplayhelligkeit00 clock out of the house, on the go music heard- from 8 - 17 clock: 5 x approx. 5 min. Videotelephony - 5 videos of 30 min each viewed - almost 1 hr on YouTube - 4 games gambled - each about 10 phone calls from average 10 min carried out - WhatsApp = At ​​the end of the day at 20 o'clock I still had 18%. The competition is a little better and more economical: Here the competition had a battery value of 31% at the end of the day • SPEAKER: Are super, mega. Rich sound much better than my iPhone X. To be honest, I was very surprised. Also with the bass I was very surprised. POSITIVE: + Display + Speaker + (VIDEO) Camera + Top ProcessingNEWRAL- Disappointing delivery- Price = Sheikh class- no real performance boost- No jack adapter, - no faster charger- Some apps do not use the large display - Disappointing Battery Disappointing development • FAZI TFo 1600 € you should give at least for its loyal Apple customers more in the scope of delivery. But Apple thinks of course in this point what: Who Apple wants to pay Apple and accessories for the small money as well I also hoped that this iTunes will finally get away and come in a different way (more innovative) used. Nothing. It remains the constant connection on iTunes.For the money, the competition is much better in my eyes. Since Steve died, one of his very good iPhones died with him. For me it was .... Thank you for reading my review! Hope it was a help in the purchase decision! If so, I would be very happy about a helpful click.
6282	iPhone XS Max	512GB	Space Gray	S.F.	1	Viiiiieeel too expensive	2018-12-30	de	Who buys a smartphone for 1600 €, has completely lost control of his life ...
6283	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Gray	BreKo	5	Apple or Samsung?	2019-05-05	de	... and this is where the ghosts divide. For years, I had always only Apple devices, always like the newest until I got stuck at some point on the iPhone 7+ and then used this until today. There were not many things that bothered me except that the system, Apple typical, is very self-contained and you have little customization options. What disturbed me even more was iTunes. Copy songs to his smartphone, pull down videos or save on it, without this iTunes not possible and for me, unfortunately, always too annoying why I tried the new Galaxy S 10+ times. Yes, I have it for several weeks tested, played around a lot and came back to the current flagship of Apple, you almost want to crawl back mine. Even if there are a few things here and there that annoy me again and again or a little nerves, it is and remains simply the best system! The smartphone is incredibly fast. The operation so wonderfully comfortable, Face ID is in my opinion the nonplusultra. This works so well here that I am sometimes amazed. Even at night in the bedroom with the lights off and minimum screen brightness it unlocks. With a picture or a photo of the person who has been saved the smartphone can not be fooled as this is a 3-D scan. All in all, I can give from my side for the device itself five stars. What I do not want to include in my review is the high price and I have to say unfortunately, I can not justify that! It is a top device and top processed and everything is wonderful and perfect, a real caress, and still. 1150 ¬, currently it is understood for a smartphone is just scary eerily a lot of money. This I would like to use now for several years, and I fortunately also because Apple provides its older devices always reliable with Updates.Ich currently synonymous, the camera of the new Huawei is very praised, especially in low-light scenarios, but why? this is very easy, the pictures are photographed with a kind of long exposure on the P30, so the photos just look very spectacular! The iPhone, on the other hand, makes normal pictures, even at night, and for the fact that these photos are not shot with a long exposure technique, they are still competitive. However, if you have a suitable app, you can also shoot with this smartphone, over the long exposure wonderful pictures! And then again, in my opinion, the P 30 can not keep up. But I do not want to put my hand in the fire for that, I just picked it up in a test for the current P 30. The price for this model is really more than premium! Almost luxury but, and you have to be honest, what you get is in terms of smartphone, just the best in the market. The software is crazy fast, safe, comfortable, easy to understand and intuitive to use, the design is very beautiful except for the slightly too far out standing camera on the back and the processing is, as with all top smartphones currently just perfect. Despite everything and the minor error I can express an absolute buy recommendation.

You can not say much about the product itself that is not already freely available in the rest of the internet. Iphones like it or not - the product has its price and it works very well. I have been using Apple products for a very long time and the upgrade of the 6+ has paid off for me.
6285	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Gray	NVNA	5	Expensive, but worth it!	2019-02-01	de	I've been using the iPhone XS Max (64GB) for 3 months now and I'm very impressed. I had some smartphones before that. Be it the S7 Edge, the Note 8 or Note 9, none of these smartphones have a chance. Sure, the cheaper, but in my opinion you notice the difference s.der performance and speakers. The display is much better calibrated than the 9 note, for example. The battery performance is very good, especially the standby mode is world class. I can recommend this smartphone to you, since it has no weaknesses and if you use the device for a few years, then the price is not so bad. + Display + Speaker + Battery + Camera especially videos are very good. + Performance + Operation - feels very smooth-priced
6286	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	Nitram	5	Bought as a Warehouse Deal at a fair price	2019-03-21	de	Bought as a Warehouse Deal at a fair price, with some late delivery. The description of Amazon is 100% true. Mint condition is really new. There are absolutely no signs of wear and tear. On the requested iOS update, I could see that the iPhone is not a month old and the battery had 100% capacity :-). To the device itself: thanks to the quick start (instructions can be found in the Apple Supportbeteich) was the move from the iPhone 8Plus a breeze. Before that, my Apple Watch decoupled quickly. After about 1/2 hour everything was done and worked perfectly. Activities, emails and apps were mirrored thanks to iCloud Backup. The Apple Watch is paired again and restored from backup. Only the password to the e-mail account had to be entered once. I was skeptical at first whether the switch from the iPhone 8Plus to the iPhone XSmax is worthwhile. Yes! Although there are no worlds in terms of feel, but Face ID, gesture control and the A12 processor are a fine thing. I think with this phone one is the future 4 - 5 years prepared for the future.

6313	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Argent 	Nam D.	1	Is the iPhone worth the money?	2018-12-14	de	Wondering if it's worth spending so much on an iPhone XS? No!!! I am an Apple user myself and have a MacBookPro and an iPhone. I still tolerated it on the MacBookPro, but not on the iPhone XS at all. It's already as expensive as the MacBook Air, which can do more ... processing or not ... the iPhone is a cell phone and has no 4GB of RAM / RAM. I think nothing of the internal memory, which can be up to 512GB. One does not use the mobile phone for 10 years, in order to use so much. No app eats up so much memory and you could not enjoy it either. I would rather wait until the iPhone is downgraded to a reasonable price that you can afford. If you want to buy a € 1,000 + cell phone, ask yourself what you want to do with it. If you just want an expensive cell phone that looks and is processed well, buy it. If you want to have a status icon that shows you can afford expensive things, the phone would be ideal. If you use a mobile phone to play, talk on the phone, chat and watch movies, you should wait at least 1 year or look for another phone. At a price of 800 € or max 900 €, I could understand it (I would always not yet worth it).

6330	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	David & Nadine	5	Noble iPhone for a great price, but worth it!	2018-12-04	de	Before, I bought the iPhone XS Max at Mediamarkt and not at Amazon, so I can not say anything about the order! I got the iPhone instead of the actually planned Huawei Mate 20 Pro, because unfortunately, like many others, too the delivery shortfalls or bottlenecks despite pre-orderer was affected and unfortunately the support from both sides (Huawei and especially Amazon) was deficient. After a long time it was then despite the more than lush and exaggerated purchase price of 1249 ¬ the iPhone. Vorab I have I tried it on Android and I was never really warm with iOS, but I was taught a better. I had to date no cleaner, liquid, noble (at the price also to be expected ) Smartphone obsessed. In addition to a number of benchmarks that are online and reviews about battery problems when loading or the runtime is low I can say flat rate that is not so, of course, depending on the use! I have the XS Max now a good three weeks despite Apple layman absolutely confident and can recommend it to anyone.Haptik 1 with asterisk design and processing noble.Drotz my initial concern that one recognizes in the color silver with chrome edge of any dirt, I am also positively surprised. The Oled display is simply a dream, bright colors , razor-sharp and without quirks or possibly errors such as the "gloo gate" at Huawei.Face ID is a personal conversion for me personally, but works perfectly and after easy familiarization, it is quite commonplace. To camera and Co. I say here nothing, plus there are enough online tests for the rest of the hardware. But there are also 2 personal flaws that annoy me: I'm still li egen the scope of supply normal EarPods with Lightning connector and the 5W charging adapter bei.Bei a purchase price of 1249 ¬ I think that you should attach at least the large 12W charger, so that the load is not 2h + lasts. And as a purchaser or pre-orderer I would like to The AirPods as a free addition pleased / a shell on the part of Apple, alone because the purchase price without the last points just crazy.However, the device is ansich for me the best mobile phone on the market! I do not want to miss it anymore and would do so now the iPhone once had very difficult to have an Android smartphone again. Therefore clear buy recommendation!
6331	iPhone XS Max	512GB	Space Gray	Ehrliche Rezensionen ✌️	3	Price-performance	2018-12-19	de	I'm quite honest ... There's not much to say about the smartphone. The display is really great, it works flawlessly and I had no problem so far. The only thing that I really find extreme is the price. It was my last iphone because these prices go too far for me. There are already many other smartphones that can do the same and only cost half.
6332	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	Flashbang	5	Quality has its price	2019-02-06	de	Anyone looking for a smartphone with the best workmanship, fluid software and top specs will definitely be happy here. Of course, the price is higher than any competitor's, but nobody is forced to buy. In addition, one can expect a life cycle of at least 3-4 years for iPhones, with constant speed of the operating system and current updates. This is so in no other device and is definitely a unique selling point and purchase argument. The display is crisp and bright. The battery keeps loose all day, and if not he can recharge quickly, even via wireless. (QI) All in one a top device for no reason of complaint. Bought in the Apple Store.

6335	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Gray	Uwe	5	Currently the only smartphone on the market, which makes sense in my view.	2019-05-28	de	Even if now some Android users will mentally stony ;-) This provocative statement of mine also applies to the other current iPhones (iPhone XS, iPhone XR). How do I get that opinion? A little story ... Six weeks ago it was time again. On a whim, I have the new Huawei P30 Pro ordered. Qualitatively a top device, the color combinations a force, the finger-print sensor a small revolution. The built-Leica camera is unrivaled for me. With a bit of patience, you get beautiful photos. In addition to the standard functions, you can even choose the aperture (for example, aperture 8 for a higher depth of field). The post-processing leaves nothing to be desired. In particular, I liked the possibility of creating monochrome images in which certain areas are provided with color. Thus, it is easily possible to represent a person in the foreground in color and the background in black and white. But where is light, is unfortunately synonymous Schatten.Die video function of the camera is unfortunately in no way on the amount of time. That would have me alive Much worse weighs the built-in mono speakers. I like listening to audiobooks on my smartphone. There was a lack of volume and dynamics. Very sad. Another K.O.-Criterion is the Bluetooth connection to the Navi.It is not possible to playlists on the device or to select specific titles. Only the functions "" Title before "", "" Title back "", "" louder "" and "" quieter In addition, songs within the playlists were displayed in the wrong order. Then, last week, came the super-Gau: Huawei was blacklisted by the US. I want to emphasize that Huawei does not blame it and I can not understand how it is possible that a single, greedy person can seal the fate of a globally recognized company.That is absolutely sad and incomprehensible to me! It came as it had to come.Future oriented and in the hope that mine Problems with the Bluetooth connection to be solved, I sold the P30 Pro with decent loss and I've gained a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. My first impression: The charger significantly slimmed, the design rather old Somewhat disappointed was the hope for decent speakers and a proper function in the car. First, the positives: The stereo speakers are top and the order of the songs within the playlists is correct. However It is also not possible with the Samsung to select playlists directly from the sat nav or to specifically select songs. I've searched several forums and unfortunately had to take as a conclusion that the Android system obviously does not provide all the necessary Bluetooth functions that are needed to control the phone completely from the sat nav. Also, with the Note 9's camera being just average, I reluctantly decided to abandon my Android experiment and return to the iPhone XS Max on my knees. Apple is extremely expensive and maybe not always technically leading, but everything works as it should .Very good photos, outstanding videos, Apple Pay (with very high acceptance compared to Google Pay and Co.) and most importantly: The Bluetooth connection works in full. So it is possible from the Navi directly through the playlists So it has to be.Was I learned from it? I will not be upset in the future about trivialities that bother me with the iPhone but on the flawless function of the devices and above all on the future joy Due to the long supply with updates as well as the above-average resale value the price of the iPhones is absolutely justified .: This review only reflects my personal opinion and I do not want to annoy or hurt anyone.

From the iPhone 5 I had every generation in use. The iPhone X in combination with iOS works perfectly and has not left me in the lurch! The whole package fits, so I can not understand some reviews here. And if you look closely it also recognizes that the negative reviews come from unverified purchases. That says it all :)
6339	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Gray	Ümit Yilmaz	5	Nearly perfect	2019-01-29	de	In terms of performance, camera quality (in good light), design and more. no one makes the XS MAX what. The new controller makes the phone extremely fast to use. FaceID almost always works perfectly and fast. Have the iPhone since it's out and regret the purchase for a second. However, bothering 2 points that is definitely the low light camera performance which is felt worse than the old iPhones and the price. 1400 ¬ are really much if Apple continues to buy I definitely no new one.

6347	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Space Gray	Malabulaba	1	Overvalued product with many disadvantages!	2019-01-26	de	For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Use only if the phone with the display is up on the table Warranty / Guarantee: The iPhone XS is indeed high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Apple gives on its products generally only 12 months Manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the price policy actually almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone from the top My assessment of a star refers exclusively to the criticism mentioned above.One note: I am willing to comment on factual comments, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and with criticism can not handle! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.
6348	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Gray	Felle	5	Only a small evolution, but very good.	2018-09-27	de	In the following report, I would like to pass on my experience with the new iPhone Xs Max. I have chosen the 64GB version in the color Space Gray. *** Packaging *** The packaging is typical as you know it from Apple and has does not change. On the front is the front of the iPhone Xs Max to see the current Planet Wallpaper. The box is now wrapped in a plastic wrap, which you can quickly raise by means of a tab. The visual presentation is successful, even if everything is already the same for years. But this is also good. *** Scope of supply *** Am Scope of supply has changed a bit this year. In addition to the power plug, Lightning cable and the Lightning headphones is this year no jack adapter beigegt.Ich have never needed this adapter, but I think it's a pity that this is no longer there. There are Certainly enough people who need this adapter and now have to pay 10 € extra for it. *** Design *** The design has not changed, except that the Xs Max is now a little bigger. The Xs is identical to the iPhone X from the last one Jahr.Das display takes now almost the entire front, the corners are rounded and fit very well into the overall picture. The Notch has not bothered me on the iPhone X and disturb them I do not get used to it this year either. I quickly got used to it from the start. But I also understand that many are dissatisfied with it. That is of course a matter of taste. In the next few years the notch will be smaller. I like the design well. Tastes are different and that's a good thing. *** Processing *** The iPhone Xs Max is really top processed, it feels really high quality and you can tell directly that you have to do it with a premium device Price, it would be bad if it were not. The transitions from the display to the stainless steel frame to the back of the glass are really perfect and clean worked. There is nothing to complain about. In addition, all buttons have a pleasant and crisp pressure point without something wobbles. That's how it should be. The workmanship has not gotten better or worse, but has remained at the same high level. Whether or not the glass has become more resistant to scratches, i I do not say, because I always use a display film. The glass back is still very susceptible to fingerprints, in the dark version you can see it even more clearly. Besides the screen protector, I always use a sleeve, so this "" problem "" does not directly concern me However, with glass backs, this is normal and can not be avoided. For Galaxy Note 9, for example, this is exactly the same. The camera on the back is still vertically arranged and it is a little bit more out this year. However, this is so minimal *** Memory *** The iPhone Xs Max is available in memory sizes 64GB, and 256GB and for the first time in 512GB. If you like movies offline and often shoot videos, especially in 4K, then In any case, you should opt for a larger storage variant. Especially films actually need the most storage space, I myself still come with 64GB of memory He handles very well, since I only leave apps and pictures permanently stored on the device. I always transfer videos to the computer to save memory. Here everyone has to decide for themselves how much memory is appropriate for the personal user experience. The price, of course also a role. ** Dual SIM ** The new iPhone now supports for the first time two SIM cards. Once the normal SIM and an eSIM.Da I do not need this feature, I can not write anything more accurate to the operation.*** Display *** The display is again an OLED display used. The colors are great, the contrast is really good, the brightness is also very good, even in a brighter environment or outdoors in the open. Due to the size of the Xs Max, the display is really a dream and it is great fun to consume content with it. The iPhone X display was also very good and I must honestly say that I could not see much difference. Both displays are at a high level. The colors are not quite as gaudy as Samsung, but these are very lively and colorful without being too oversaturated. The viewing angles are also good, but still not 100% optimal. For a white background, for example, this is a bit bluish if one From the side on it looks. In normal everyday use this falls as good as ever, but it must be mentioned. This can also vary from device to device In the case of the iPhone Xs Max, this is much less noticeable. If the display should have too much yellowish tint, then this can be corrected in the following way: 1. Enable True tone2. For display adjustments - - Activate color filter3. Activate color cast4. Set intensity between A and T5. Set the color tone between blue and purple (The pens at the top are the orientation) Then the display is as it should be. True tone can then be deactivated again. I am still not a fan of True Tone and leave this always off. *** Loudspeaker *** The iPhone Xs Max are again 2 speakers are used which should provide for stereo quality. A speaker is located as usual on the bottom, the second speaker gives the sound on the earpiece The quality is really good. The sound is nice clear and loud and it's fun to watch videos and listen to music. Unlike the iPhone X, the sound quality has improved a bit. I'm really happy with that. ** * Battery *** The battery is a big plus point in the iPhone X Max.I'm already well understood with the battery performance of the iPhone X, the iPhone Xs Max was this noticeably improved Also, there are no problems with the battery life, so you will be quite satisfied. With the iPhone Xs Max you can easily get through the day. For me it is at least 2 days and often I have to recharge only on the third day. It comes Of course, it depends on how strong you use the device. More battery is always good and therefore this is also a very good improvement to the iPhone X.Wireless charging is also supported again. All Charging Pads that support the QI standard can be used. I used a Wireless Charging Pad from Samsung and Anker.Beides works without problems. Fast Charging supports the iPhone Xs Max again, but you have to buy a separate power supply for this year. This I did not and I will not in the future. *** Performance *** The new A12 Bionic processor is used. Everything runs smoothly. Whether switching between apps, opening apps, zooming, wiping and scrolling Everything is very smooth and fast. Ruckler I could not find any. It is really great fun to use the iPhone.Here you have to mention fair that this also applies to the iPhone X. Here, the operation was also great and there were no problems. The improved performance is also more or less noticeable only in direct comparison. All normal apps like the camera, contacts, phone or WhatsApp can be opened at the same speed. For example, the timeline of Instagram or Twitter opens a little faster. Also, the loading times are a bit shorter for some games. But I think this will be for the In addition, the IOS12 again improves the performance, even with "" older devices "" The overall performance and the interaction between software and hardware is really great, even if it was only slightly improved. One should not expect a huge jump. The speed of load times compared to a Galaxy Note 9 is about the same, at least when it comes to apps. Sometimes the iPhone is slightly faster, then the touch again 9.All normal apps such as the camera, phone, etc. open pretty much fast. The boot process at Note 9 is a bit faster, but are the iPhone Xs Max the loading times at games something shorter.The change between the apps is also the same. But the differences are actually so small, so that they are not really important and only make themselves felt in direct comparison. *** Face ID *** I must honestly say that I am with The technology works reliably and for me sufficiently fast. In the iPhone X, I had quickly got used to it, so now no getting used to it. Touch ID was and is good, but personally I do not mourn the fingerprint sensor after. The setup is very fast and simple. After the face has been scanned twice Face ID can be used. Nothing has changed here. On the lockscreen is a small lock to see, this symbolizes whether the iPhone was locked or unlocked. After successful unlocking you wipe up and you get immediately to the home screen. Also here everything has remained unchanged. Face ID works now very minimal faster. However, this is only in direct comparison auf.Im everyday use has remained the same: As already advertised on the iPhone X. Face ID also works with a hat, scarf or sunglasses and with the same speed.-If you have your eyes closed, Face ID will not work, even if you close your eyes behind a pair of sunglasses it will not work.-Face ID works normal daylight, in bright lighting, for example, with Philips Hue, under artificial light and outdoors without problems.-In a dark Face ID also works very well and without any problems.-I have the iphone sitting in a small stand on the desk.If I wake the iPhone standing up with a double tap, and look at it from top to bottom, Face ID also works , One does not have to hold the iPhone exactly in front of the face and always pay attention to the exact distance. *** everyday use *** The iPhone Xs Max is about as big as the Plus models, just without this thick frame top and bottom.Ich had previously always the Plus models, so I come with this size also very well klar.Ich operate the device with two hands, and that is no Umwöhung for me. In Galaxy Note 9, this is the same. My hands are also rather small. If you just want to type a message, it works with one hand, but that's an exception. It may sound funny, but since the device is so big you have to make sure that the pockets are big enough, then you get There are no problems here. With small tight trouser pockets you have no chance to stow the iPhone Xs Max. Although the Xs Max is larger than the normal Xs, unfortunately the display does not show any content anymore.Unfortunately, the apps are not yet adjusted. In the Plus models, there was always a landscape mode in the homescreen. In the iPhone Xs Max, there is not this. (Except for the apps) The new gestures introduced in the iPhone X I still find this year good and there are no problems in everyday life. I've also gotten used to it in the last year. With iOS 12, all open apps can be closed by wiping upwards. You no longer have to press the respective app to see it afterwards The one can only see the percentage of the battery in the controller center, has also remained the same. The upper recess for the camera is and remains in any case a matter of taste. For me personally, this recess was never annoying. I could not find any negative problems in connection with it which disturbed me in any way. *** Camera *** Often there are only marketing slogans when it comes to improvements of the camera But here you have to say that the camera is actually better than it was the case with the iPhone X. The pictures with the new camera make a very good impression. The pictures are now sharper, more colorful, they have less noise and it The colors of the pictures are very natural. Even under bad lighting conditions, the better camera noticeable. Also here you can see a difference. The pictures are also brighter and the noise was reduced. The depth of field effect can now also edit later similar to how it is synonymous with Samsung möglich.Auch that works very well. I have to say that I'm not a professional, for For me the pictures just have to look good and that is the case with the new iPhone Xs Max. Professionals will be able to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the pictures even better. I can not do that. Newly added is that the video camera now synonymous the sound The sound is definitely better, but it depends on the situation where you film. The quality of the videos is generally very good. The picture is super fluid and sharp. Here is nothing for me to moan. Whether Nature shots, videos from and with friends or videos from the family, the camera gives very good results. In summary, the camera has gotten better and you can see it, but that does not mean that the iPhone X camera was bad or is *** Conclusion *** You will notice that the new iPhone Xs has improved only a bit to its predecessor and rather only a few optimizations were made. I buy each year the new iPhone, this is equivalent he is not the norm, but because of the fact that technology is a big hobby of mine. This year, it is me but heavier than usual fallen. My biggest purchase reason was the larger Display. I always had the Plus models, and had me this size For this reason, I am also very satisfied and regret the purchase in no case. The quality is as always very very good, the display is fantastic, the battery has been improved and the camera makes even better pictures. The iPhone Xs Max is really great, but this also applies to the predecessor, the iPhone X. Here comes the price question into the game and you should think twice, if you want to pay the extra charge for the newest model. But you really want one iPhone in this size and you're used to such big smartphones, then the Xs Max is the right choice. I've added images comparing the size of iPhone Xs Max and the Galaxy Note 9 show.An example of the kicker app shows how much content the respective display shows.
6349	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Gray	Wolfgang K.	3	Professionals do not always trust!	2018-12-27	de	Contrary to the statement of some professional testers the mobile network reception is better than with my previously used Galaxy S8 plus. For the exorbitant high price one also acquires an unrivaled smooth running and from the ground up logically structured operating system. A star deduction for the high price and because SIRI is far less smart than the Google Assistant. Addendum devaluation by another star: With "" Messages "" and "" Facetime "" neither by support nor resetting to the delivery condition can fix the recurring connection error. Cell phone went back.
6350	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Gray	Günter F. Zimmermann	2	Complicated	2019-05-18	de	After iPhone 5,6,7plus I wanted to do something special and bought the XSmax. Although the reviews were mostly good, I would not buy this device anymore. I find it extremely complicated and causes problems with the eternal passwords. I entered my password incorrectly when setting up and Apple locked the device for 2 weeks. When it was unlocked after 2 weeks the ID was changed and I could not do anything again. Unfortunately, the return period has passed through the long blocking period and I do not know at the moment how it should go on. Therefore my rating with only 2 stars
6351	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Argent 	Peter	5	Best iPhone - only recommended !!	2019-06-24	de	What can I say...? Best iPhone, what ever! Everyone can find tests on technology etc. on the internet. Here is just my personal impression. I never wanted an iPhone - until about 4 years ago was still enthusiastic Android / Samsung fan. Then I had the iPhone 6s - THAT was a great phone! Aluminum body and a top OS. I quickly got used to this flatterer. Just perfect and no problem with any Android Samsung updates ... Then I saw the Samsung S8 + with his display ... and went again strange ... The Samsung I used about 1 year - then I have the aluminum, the processing, the look and especially the feel / operation of the iPhone misses again I then bought the iPhone 7 Plus. GREAT! Super large display - but just "" only "" LCD ... But what the hell - was still like a home come "" in the iOS world ... :-) From the iPhone XS MAX, I was afraid for a long time because of Price back !!! But after I recently had it live in an electronics market and was allowed to marvel at the display - I was "" in love with the shock ""! ;-) The price I did not care now and I got the 256 GB version in silver. The price was worth it now. Everyone has to decide for themselves. Surely the Samsung 10 might be better - but as an Apple follower (I also have iMac, MacbookPro, Applewatch and iPad), this XS MAX has been a "must-have" for me. And I'm absolutely thrilled! This feeling while touching ... a great piece of technology from a single source. I have not looked back...  :-)
6352	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	Lisa	5	Mobile phone of the luxury class	2019-03-04	de	I am completely satisfied with the new iPhone! The new camera is much better than my old iPhone 6 Plus. The big screen is gorgeous. The optical design Apple is also well succeeded. It is a very high price for a smart phone. But once you become an Apple fan, you are not satisfied with any other smartphone anymore.
6353	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Space Gray	Agawe	4	Handy mega - I'm afraid it's not a new device	2019-03-10	de	One thing in advance - I think the XS max mega !! I bought it in space gray. For me, the color is not so important because my phone is always in a leather case. 256GB, which are good enough for me. The unpacking has given me a damper. Everything looked like the original box. But after peeling off the film from the display, I discovered there was grease / veil. Like putting a finger on the side. I was skeptical. I put the phone on trial anyway. TO XS MAX SELF: - Finally a battery that can compete with other providers. That was always a shortcoming for iPhones. Crystal-clear large display that uses the full surface. Really nice.- The two cameras take beautiful pictures, even with bad exposure- The portrait filter, which grurrles the background and embellished the face with a filter, is wonderfully usable with both cams and achieves great results. I have already tried other brands. They do not work on the here.- The sound quality is good- The Face ID is a dream and works as good as ever. Unless you lie crumpled on the side of a pillow or half your arm in front of the face You have to get used to the size or you have to like it and like it.MY FAZITslightly_smiling_face: Most likely, I will send this device back and let me have a new one , If I zoome a bright picture in the photo album, then the picture starts to flicker. Not always. But in connection with the Tapser on the original packed display. That should not be true at the price. But Apple can not do anything. The mobile phone in sight is great.

I have the iPhone from the beginning, I always liked the balance. Good product, good software, feel good about owning an iPhone. That's not the case anymore. Profit XXL, leadership mistakes, no vision, total digitization, misuse of customers with corresponding injuries. It all upsets the balance. What a pity.

The device offers over the 8 plus various advantages, especially since the display can be used much better. The Touch ID I was initially caught with skepticism, but this was quickly cleared out of the way when I experienced the speed and perfected form of face recognition. The camera is as expected of a wonderful quality stocked. The night mode has become very capable, contours at night are much sharper, more detailed & perfected by the black level. I was most surprised by the display. What makes a difference between lcd and oled! The technology that when Oled all diodes individually driven mirrors the over from detailed & color-faithful reproduction da.Von the processing I eig.

6362	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Gold	Dossi	5	Beautiful, great feel	2019-03-24	de	It is simply beautiful. Basically nothing other than the iPhone 7 Plus, which I had before. That was already expensive. The mobile phone now costs almost 1400 €. I did not buy it from Amazon, only the accessories here. It feels good in the hand, is my choice, everything runs without problems. Is just Apple and my preference. I have had a lot of Android related issues, I just do not like it. This device is for people who are traveling irrationally. Maybe the competition is doing just as well. But iOS does not even run on the Galaxy S 10. That's why I do not even look at it.

6364	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Space Gray	M.K.	5	Logical step forward	2018-10-09	de	Do you need an iPhone XS? If you already have an iPhone X, the jump will not be enough. But with the iPhone XS Max is now finally a larger model in the premium range of the iPhone models available. Despite the 6.5 inches, the phone with average-sized male hands is easy to use. The build quality is like the X a dream and can hardly better his. Face ID runs a little faster and has become better at awkward angles. If you've always wanted a bigger version of the iPhone X, the XS MAX is definitely the right choice!

6367	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Space Gray	Christoph K.	5	iPhone Max (imus) - in many ways, including the price	2019-07-05	de	Hello community, with a few exceptions (see my Essential Phone Review) I have been using Apple's 4 from 2010 primarily just more devices from Apple. This also has its reason: the ecosystem and some other trivial things convince me for years at Apple simply more. Usually in the rhythm of two years, I have each brought me a new generation. After careful consideration I'm this year after only about 10 months of iPhone X switched to XS Max. The huge display has just done to me. Enclosed now my experience with the device since release. (Summary below in the conclusion). Packing: Apple-typical, the delivery is once again limited to the bare minimum. In addition to iPhone itself is still a low-power 5W power adapter, a USB Type A to Lightning cable (1m) and the "EarPods" called headphones in the small box. There is still a bit of paperwork and two Applesticker.Usutlich monetary policy reasons, this year the Lightning was painted on 3.5mm jack adapter. Wired headphones can therefore only be connected if you buy the adapter separately for an additional 10 EUR. Design and workmanship: The design language Apple has left the XS Max in the much the same as that of the iPhone 6. The now made of stainless steel frame is slightly rounded and is free of unequal gaps in the glass front and back over. Cut-outs for speakers, connection and above all for the single SIM slot have been processed absolutely clean. There is nothing to complain about the remaining keys as well. The volume, the "Leister" and the "Power" keys can be easily felt and react as desired at any time. The slider for "silent" could be a bit heavier for my sense. A little bit unattractive is also that the glass back is typically very prone to fingerprints and therefore usually looks a little dirty. The same applies to the stainless steel frame.In sum of all features, the device still feels incredibly high quality. With just over 200 g, the device is not exactly a lightweight, but emphasizes once again the very noble appearance of the phone. Incidentally, the size is very similar to that of the Plus models.Display: The 6.5 "OLED display with a crooked resolution of 2688x1242 pixels (458ppi) resolves very sharply and covers it with a ratio of 19.5: 9 85% the entire front surface. As with all predecessors, the refresh rate remains at max. 60 Hz (the touch sensitivity, however, at 120 Hz). With the naked eye and without measuring devices, I can put absolutely nothing on the display. OLED typical, the black levels are perfect (black is black) and the max. Brightness is absolutely sufficient, even under the open sky in the sunshine. The display supports the extended color space after "Display P3" and is HDR10 compatible with DolbyVision. Or more simply, the color representation is also excellent. So that colors are also displayed as intended, Apple calibrates each device individually. What I also noticed positively, is that the front glass and the display below form a quasi unity. Both are so close together that one has the feeling, for example, to touch an icon directly (many devices have a visible layer of air between them). At Apple, however, this is already several generations longer.Performance: This year, the manufacturer has again turned on the performance screw. The performance increase is compared to its predecessors on paper, although as small as never before, but are still processor and graphics unit Also noteworthy is that since the 6s Apple has built particularly fast memory modules based on an SSD and thus additionally improves the overall performance. The device responds very smoothly at any time. Whether long menu lists, elaborate websites in the browser or the resource-hungry games make no difference (unlike z.on the Essential Phone in some areas). Generally, iOS 12 always responds directly to touch gestures. Scrolling is always smoother for me than it is for Android, and the delay in the millisecond range between touching the screen and the first reaction is faster and more accurate than on Android. (In words, the feeling is really hard to describe) All in all, it can be said that the iPhone XS Max has enough power reserves for the next few years too. Software and apps: The XS Max comes with the latest software version, iOS 12. In addition smaller meaningful additions this year a special focus on an improved general performance. Most benefit from older iPhones, but version 12 is also the largest iPhone ever very good. The special thing about Apple is still that the different device categories very interlinked are. Many things are synchronized via the iCloud and are automatically available on iPad or Mac (photos, news documents, etc.). An automatically performed data exchange via the iCloud is very easy to set up and is therefore aimed at non-tech savvy people important point here so clearly for the Apple ecosystem speaks. Another important point for me is the direct software support by the manufacturer. Up to 5 years, the devices are supported with new major releases. Unique in the smartphone sector! In the event that security vulnerabilities are known, Apple i.d.R. Updates very quickly after-for all reasonably current devices. As a platform disadvantage is of course the closed system to see. On the iPhone comes only what is left by Apple in the AppStore. A certain kind of patronage that certainly does not taste many. But this also ensures that the security compared to Android is simply higher. By the way, the app offer via the store is very good and is in no way inferior to the one in Google PlayStore. Most of the time, quite the contrary, because many apps are simply better implemented by the same developer for iOS - in my opinion, at least. By the way, apps related to the iPhone XS Max have to be adapted to the new display resolution by the developer. Those only adapted to the X are simply displayed larger. The first apps are already available for the XS Max and then offer more content. In the next few weeks and months will certainly do much here.Camera: At first glance, compared to the X has not done much - it remains at 12 MP.Von this fact should not be fooled. All the improvements can be found under the hood or in the more powerful software. On the hardware side, the new camera system sheds more light on the sensor, with the result that more details can be recorded especially in low-light conditions. At the same time, the software ensures this , that all inclusive several photos of different exposure are taken and put together to a photo (simply said). The algorithm behind this Apple simply calls Smart HDR. Of all this, the user does not notice the way. All calculations are live and in real time. Smart HDR is especially visible when very bright and very dark spots appear together on a picture. Specifically, light areas are reduced a bit and thus get more details, while dark areas are highlighted. As an example, I would like to call a photo against the sun here. By the way, I am very satisfied with the camera upgrade, I am even very positively surprised. The difference even to the X is in any case greater than I would have expected in the beginning. In comparison, the XS Max is visibly better than the Essential Phone and can certainly keep up in the field of photography with the Android flagship Samsung, Huawei and Co.Improvements Apple made this year synonymous with video recordings. These can now finally be recorded in stereo. Furthermore, up to UHD at 60 Hz or FHD at 240 Hz for slow motion is recorded. Thanks to optical stabilization (OIS), videos also appear to be quite free from camera shake for a smartphone and are not compressed too much. The iPhone will continue to be the reference for video. The front camera continues to have 7 MP, but now support 60 Hz at FHD for Videotelefonie.An Selfie fanatics and Instagram users, however, new gadgets with background blur (bokeh) in portrait mode. The blur effects can be adjusted at any time in hindsight at will and that is very intuitive. Operation: The sheer size of the XS Max naturally also has a corresponding effect on the operation. Even with big hands, it takes some practice to operate the device with one hand. In order to reach the top and bottom of the display, it requires a dynamic posture in the hand. This can be achieved quite well by means of generous thumb movements. Basic controls such as Control Center, Notification Center or the "Back" gesture can thus still be operated. Comfortable and safe, but something else. Preferably I use the phone therefore with two hands, alone for the reason that simple short messages with two thumbs can be written much faster. Also, the much smaller iPhone X, I usually have two Used hands. The conversion is so limited for me. Since the introduction of the iPhone X in 2017 finally the annoying home button was deleted and replaced by a very intuitive swipe gesture. The general ease of use has therefore further increased for my taste. The proven Touch-ID finger scanner has now been replaced by Face-ID, a 3D face scanner. The unlocking of the iPhone takes a very short time longer, but for my feeling, however, reliable. Especially in terms of sweaty or simply wet hands, there were with Touch-ID again and again recognition difficulties. Touch ID was particularly negative to me at the time when I was traveling home on the construction site and I had building materials in my hands every day and therefore the sensor had to be read in every two days. With Face-ID you are spared all this. The eyewear, caps / hats tested by me were never a problem for face recognition. On the subject of security is said that Face-ID, unlike many implementations on Android can not be tricked by a simple photo. Lt. Manufacturer is Face-ID also safer than Touch ID. Battery: Compared to the iPhone X and the recently used Essential Phone, it is much more durable battery. With an identical use case and the same usage time, I usually spend about 1.5 days with the X on about 2.5 days. For me it means: some news / mail, 45 minutes of news reading, 15 minutes of video watching, 30 minutes of streaming music, 30 minutes of other searches in Safari, occasionally taking some photos, other short games. The display Mainstream Eater is controlled by Auto Brightness and is usually set below 50%. If possible I use in each app the dark surface (Dark-Mode). This helps the OLED display to save energy. Bluetooth and GPS are turned on only when used actively. The run times that Apple itself gives seem to be plausible. Cable-bound charging by means of the included 5 W power supply I would not recommend the way. The charging times are just too long with 3.5 hours. Through separate accessories can be the XS Max in 30 min to 50 % fast loading. For this purpose, a power supply with min.18 W, USB-C port and USB PowerDelivery and a Lightning USB-C cable needed, so additional expenditure of about 40 EUR.Als price / performance tip, however, the 12 W iPad power supply is recommended for about 17 EUR or a third-party Power supply of this performance class - eg from anchor for about 13 EUR. Charging times of about 2 - 2.5 hours are therefore realistic. Alternatively, the iPhone can be "wireless" on the standard Qi with at least up to 7.5 watts and in about 3 hours laden.Other: Some users have lt. Internet entries div. Techn. Problems with their XS models (loading bugs, poor LTE reception,). I could not find any of these points for me. LTE reception I feel even better than the iPhone X. Especially the topic of LTE XS is a exciting. Here, Apple has made comparatively large changes, which can have a positive effect, especially in practice. The new Gigabit LTE modem is by 4x4 MIMO very often significantly faster than that of the X, as it simply said, the existing LTE infrastructure can better exploit the network operator. On average I can see a 50% improvement in the download rate at the sites I tested. The best: I do not have to pay more for my network operator. A corresponding tariff with high max. Download rates is required. Otherwise, it may already be throttled (by the network operator) before the XS Max can exploit its advantage. Conclusion: Bottom line is Apple's XS Max, once again, the best iPhone ever. Processing and haptics are above all doubt and can absolutely convince. The OLED display is one of the best that you can get in smartphones and represents the sheer size of much content dar. Also performance in terms of CPU, GPU performance, but Also in terms of speed and fluidity of the operating system are Referenz.berzeugen can also convince the new camera system - mainly by software tricks with Smart HDR.Auch the operation has been revolutionized by swipe gesture instead of home button and Face ID instead of Touch ID really a few and just very well implemented. As annoying I see the minimum scope of delivery and of course the absurdly high price of 1.419 EUR MSRP for 256 GB. Can the device really justify such a high price? I would say no! A very large proportion of users will find Android in much of comparable services at less than half of the price. The iPhone XS Max shows me that despite mega performance, the price / performance ratio still maximally with the note "Satisfactory" can be evaluated. Especially since many accessories must be purchased separately again / can and of course even more money in the cash registers of the manufacturer rinses.Richtig is outrageous (at the price) that no jack adapter and no quick charger are attached.Dennoch, the iPhone is for me no alternative because I have not actually opted for the iPhone itself, but rather for the Apple ecosystem. So one is unfortunately more willing to bite into the clearly too expensive apple. If I do not consider the price, the iPhone XS Max still deserves 5 stars. Otherwise it is rather 4. ++ Design / Processing ++ Display ++ Performance Hardware / Software + Camera ++ Operation + Battery Scope Price If my review was helpful, I would be very happy to receive a corresponding rating. Many Thanks!

6373	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Wolfgang G.	3	not all gold that glitters	2018-11-14	de	Many (even "" professional "" reviews currently read that the iPhone XR is even better than the X or Xs.I can not fully recommend the iPhone XR. Definitely not. Especially in view of the high price, I will feel not at all, that Apple has not "made an effort" with the XR. "Yes, the device is valuable and looks like ... all other smartphones too, with only Apple logo on the back, front glass, rear glass, aluminum side. The screen is bright, very bright, iOS 12 runs well and smoothly like iOs11 or iOS10, and the battery life is praiseworthy, which lasts a good two days, but despite all this, I rather feel like I want to put the device away quickly, though not because of the 6-inch size, no, but because the screen for this price dissolves too low, not even Full HD, and you can see that more than expected (I also own a LG V30 with 2K OLED Panel and previously had a Huawei Mate 10 Pro) And moreover, the display lacks the color intensity that one may expect in this price range. The thicker edges compared to the iPhone X or Xs disturb since least of all. In short, the display is only good and bright, but neither eye candy nor brilliant. There are 200, - € Androids same performance (for example, Motorola G series, Huawei Mate 20 lite). In 2018, it is simply not enough to make an LCD display with a leaner 300 + x dpi resolution for more than 800, - € and then label this proudly "" Retina "" display. Besides the no more than average LCD -Display there is another star deduction - and that's my biggest criticism because the feel does not fit. The iPhone XR wants to be put out of hand rather than taken in hand. The device is just too thick and especially for the 6 inches clearly too heavy. 196g is a challenge. With shell well over 200g.You can tell that unpleasantly in your hand. And I have big strong hands at 1.83 meters and 90kg. The iPhone XR wants to follow gravity and feels more like a lump, a heavy lump, than like an elegant smartphone. My LG V30 (please only for comparison - it's not about the discussion Android or Apple) also weighs only 6 inches with 156g and is almost 2mm thinner. Yes, iPhones have always been a bit more weighty, which has so far been marketed as a typical Apple value. But that fails completely. I almost have the feeling that Apple wanted to bring a 6 incher on the market - no matter how. Conclusion: for over 800, - Euro is not enough a "" good "" or "" better than expected "" for display quality and hardware. In this price range, Apple and the world of smartphones is in the high-end class. The device is too clunky and heavy, the screen bright, but the resolution and color saturation only mediocre, a fancy LCD screen, nothing more. Therefore, only 3 stars. Supplement: After some here my comment as almost "" idiotic "" comment the following: I am neither Apple Hater nor Android advocates, but had the last few years numerous top smartphone, including iPhones. If Apple calls up a price of over 800, - €, then the XR has to compare even in this price range. Sure, someone who has always used iPhones will praise the XR. But in direct hardware (!) Comparison, it definitely can not compete with comparable devices. It's a lot heavier, it's a lot bulkier, it's much thicker and has a VISIBILITY lower screen resolution and thicker edges than comparison devices. If you put a LG G7, a Huawei P20, a Galaxy S9, a OnePlus 6 or something else next to it, then the iPhone looks just like yesterday. Whether the software with iOS12 or Android appeals to you, everyone may decide for themselves. And whether the processor with PC performance for WhatsApp, taking pictures and telephoning is needed as well. But I'm not referred to by anyone as mentally "limited" or biased "Apple Hater", who may have never had another phone in their hands. And just this week in relevant IT newspapers to read: Apple must reduce the production of XR iPhones by 30% ... Yes, why? Because the Stiftung Warentest writes, it would be so good?
6374	iPhone XR	64GB	Coral	S. D.	5	iphone XR is great	2018-11-11	de	Since 26.10.2018 the Iphone XR is available. Strange that there is only one customer review. But when I look at the prices here, I'm not really surprised. Here 897 € and more are called. Even at Apple directly costs the XR 64 GB 849 ¬. If you buy an XR here, you are no longer capable of doing business. I personally had the XR in yellow, but I exchanged it for the Iphone XS Max 64 GB in gold. But since I still have the X, I'm about giveback at Apple me the XR still take, probably in coral. I think the XR is awesome. If you see the full posts on youtube, where one of the other nachsabbelt the other, that is incompetent to be incompetent. You can watch these videos as a kind of comedy show. There is talk of a weak diploma resolution, of the size, the weight, disadvantages of the camera and sometimes the colors are criticized. Colors: If you stick to the topic of colors, my opinion is that you can only take yellow or coral. There are still blue (for me baby blue), Product Red (there was already the 8 in a product red version so nothing new), black and white. Since the XR should be more of a lifestyle object because of the colors, for me the usual monotony falls out, so black or white, with white in the present form (ie real white) is still somehow acceptable. But sense makes the purchase of an XR only in a correct color and sees for me especially yellow very noble ais, but the more interesting color is coral, by the way, also looks quite noble. Camera: The camera at the XR is generally praised in all tests synonymous compared to the XS / XS Max. It is just no dual camera, but should provide the moodier pictures. I myself could not test it yet because I do not have the XR n o c h, but the tests and descriptions are all consistent and credible to me. The possibilities with the front camera are the same as with the XS, there are all 5 portrait possibilities available, with the main camera only 3, which I consider completely sufficient. You can not use the bokeh effect on the main camera if you want to record an object or something like that in portrait mode, or at least not a person. Of course you can still take a normal picture anyway. Otherwise the cameras are qualitatively identical with the XS and the XR except for the zoom. Apple will have thought very carefully that you can not sell high-priced iPhones like the XS or XS Max as colorful mobile phones well, there is always the danger that one Looking at the color but rather sattsieht, so seen, the price for the XR is appropriate, since it looks quite noble because of the glass on the front and back and consequent changed changed depending on the light color reflections on the back. From IOS 12.1, the bokeh effect is already adjustable during or before recording and even after the recording.Face-ID: I can not understand the people who are still crying the homebutton, I use iphones from the beginning, so since 2008, I do not want to exchange the homebutton for Face-ID anymore.Recently I used the 8 + again after a long time with the X, the Homebutton really bothered me. As soon as you take the XS in your hand, it's already unlocked, even the gesture control without the homebutton is ideal, so I do not want to see the homebutton anymore and that will be so in the future. Chip: I do not want to go into the technology , on the A-12 bionic chip you can read something on every corner, I personally never thought that you notice the differences in speed as a user at all, all the iphones I've had so far have always run flatly without complaining : Apple uses an LC display on the XR, an OLED on the X, XS and XS Max. In my opinion, the LCD is so good that I would not open a keg in the sense that the quality of the LCD is poorer, considering the data on the paper, but the personal impression and that should be decisive. I compare the quality with the 8 plus and I found that very good and m.E. like the XR not criticizable. The display size of the XR is ideal, just between the XS and the XS Max, the X and the XS I think from the beginning to small, the trend goes for some time clearly to the larger displays, alone photos or videos see on larger displays getting better. Unfortunately, the X 2017 was only available in a diaplay size. I wonder if the people who rummage on the display have even tried the display customization, which can be a big deal. If I do not adjust the Dispaly on the X, the colors look much paler, I use the color filter blue / yellow, which meets my taste perfectly, the colors are much brighter, anyone can try that out for themselves. So then the XR will be brighter and color even more beautiful. The intensity can also be adjusted individually.Conclusion: For me, the XR is a fantastic iphone, whose purchase I would fully recommend, if one adds all the features together, such as the colors, the display size, the excellent processing, camera, chip, design, speakers, etc. Just a little to present case tests , the Stiftung Warentest, of which I think nothing at all, has the XR the drop test there as certified attested and expressly praised. There are simulated in a kind of drum 100 crashes, absolutely unrealistic, considering that a user should fall down the iphone the same number of times. It's like taking a thicker slice. It also breaks down if you only hit it often enough. Personally, an iphone 4 and also a 6 + have each fallen down once a day without significant damage. The Stiftung Warentest makes a sport out of it according to the motto: How do I finally get an iphone broken? And then it is explained in the media: iphone "" so-and-so "" in the case test. A rogue, who thinks that other mobile phones, and of course no iPhones should be favors, that's just populist. As hosts of cheer Android users, but these phones are unfortunately regularly through even in this category. Clearly, the XS should be something, but not so much better, you always have to remember that you have to pay in the comparable memory size 300 ¬ more. The XS Max is great and just in the gold version very noble, but the XR I think because of the colors and not least because of the much cheaper price for even more sexy and as already mentioned, I have the XS Max and therefore actually no reason Favor XR. In the XR, Apple has done the splits between a slightly cheaper and still noble iphone outstanding. One can of course say, why take an XS, if you already have X, but here is not the XS, but the XS Max because of the display size and the improved camera features the attractive iphone, the XR but more interesting. For me, the XR is wrongly underestimated.
6375	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Macinson	4	Maybe the secret star of the 2018 models	2018-11-15	de	First of all, I did not purchase my device from Amazon, but directly from the Apple Store. Furthermore, I have decided against the XR (but tried extensively), but more on that later, After I have now omitted some devices since the iPhone 6, it was time to buy a new iPhone. Basically, it was probably not the best Right now, since the iPhones have come into new dimensions in price terms since the X - but I guess that they will not come out there too fast. Nevertheless, so off to the Apple Store, the latest generation XS, XS Max and XR in to take his hands. Well, for someone coming from the iPhone 6, this is obviously a visual and haptic quantum leap (applies to XS and XR). The display of all devices is really great, with the XR is minimal behind the top devices, since only these have an OLED display (when you look closely and depending on the content played you notice that too). Without holding both devices in the hand, you will be completely satisfied with the display of the XR and in daily use you will probably hardly realize the difference, since the XR also has a great display. After a little testing and touching in the store, I decided to use the XS primarily because of the size, because I often carry the phone in my pocket, the XR is unfortunately a bit too big and too heavy for me (even if it is just a few millimeters / gram more). There have already been big jumps in a model change in the past, but now with the dimensions of the iPhone 6, the space in my pants or shirt pocket is exhausted, but that's an absolute matter of taste. The weight increase from the iPhone 6 to the XS of just under 50g can be clearly seen at the beginning, and the XR is a bit heavier again. Compare dimensions and weights iPhone X dimensions: 150.9 mm x 75.7 mm x 8.3 mmWeight 143.6 mm x 70.9 mm x 7.7 mmWeight: 177gFrom the scope of functions it would have been absolutely enough for me and also the Preisgefüge is a lot more appealing (in so far as the prices can still be described as such). Also, the Xr is offered as the only device with 128 GB, which would have been the ideal memory size for my application. Here I feel the jumps from 64GB to 256GB at the XS just as price gouging. The now existing "full screen" I think is really great and of course much more fun compared to my previous iPhone. The "Notch" (the black bar on the top of the iPhone) really does not bother me at all (there are probably some critics here). The edge of the XR seems a bit wider, but still inconspicuous and not annoying. After I had the device XS) now a few days in use, I had to realize that one misses the missing homebutton not a second, because you intuitively very quickly got used to the new handling. Even Face-ID works with me absolutely easily and makes it easier to log in synonymous in various apps. This will probably not be much different for the Xr, as it also carries the same A12 Bionic chip as the XS series in the heart. Conclusion: Overall, Apple has brought here again a number of top phones on the market, but the XR certainly has the potential to the "People's iPhone" and I would definitely have bought it if it was a little smaller and lighter. Who has no problem and can do without the somewhat reduced features, will probably be happy with this phone the next few years and you can safely skip some model changes. The XS I have deducted a star because of the price, the XR unfortunately I have to steal a star due to the dimensions (for my taste). I hope my personal and subjective assessment was helpful to be able to better assess the product.
6376	iPhone XR	64GB	Coral	Humbi	5	Much better than many say	2019-01-05	de	I ordered the device in color coral yesterday 11 o'clock, today on Saturday 10 o'clock it was in the packing station. CLASS! To the device: I come from the iPhone 8 and have switched to the XR, as I have a larger display and especially an alternative unlock option for Touch ID have searched. I have because of my job as a painter often not the cleanest hands, since it was always a pain to unlock the 6 or 8 by Touch ID. The only option was the PIN, which I then changed to 4 extra places instead of 6 digits. This was too annoying for me. So here with an Apple device with Face ID! The Face ID runs smoothly, you do not even have to look closely and talk - the device is unlocked or passwords are displayed or apps start or apps are downloaded. SIMPLE CLASS! Display: Many moan about the display. I say: nonsense! The display is bright, clean and I do not see a single pixel. I think it's better than the 8th display and I'm completely satisfied! So: I can only recommend the device. The size is not even true in the evening, on the contrary, the "" old "" 4.7 inch iPhones appear immediately tiny again. I have no big hands but I used to have the Galaxy Note devices (up to 4) and so know even a few handles if the smartphone is a bit voluminous.FAZIT: I can only recommend it! The X, or Xs was too expensive for me, so I grabbed the XR and I'm really excited! The price is now Apple typical, but you get synonymous Apple-typical feel, iOS, etc. The skin is already out!
6377	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Herr Urmel	5	Fast-paced, excellent 4K video recording and a moderate display	2019-02-08	de	** Initial situation ** I had an iPhone SE before, which became too small for me. Due to the highly praised camera in the Xr I just ordered this one. ** Packaging and shipping ** Ordered directly through Amazon, I can not understand such a bad packaging with such an expensive product. The package was crushed outside, the film of the original packaging already half open and on the side of this a small dent. If you order it directly from Apple, it will come in excellent padded delivery !! Note 6 for Amazon. ** Scope of delivery ** The package is very sad, there are only EarPods with Lightning connection, a (short) Lightning on USB-A cable, the paperwork with opening tool and stickers and the well-known 5W power supply, which takes a felt eternity to charge the smartphone. But I'm still glad that no quick charger is there, such a burdened by the high charging currents the battery is very much and shortens its life. ** Processing ** It is really nicely done. The workmanship is impeccable and it feels high quality, not least because of the high weight of almost 200 grams (!) I would recommend to look at it in advance in an Apple Store and take in the hand. The keys do not wobble and have clean pressure points. The white back in my case is really snow white. I like it very much in connection with the silver frame and the black Displayrand.Ohne cover it is very slippery by the aluminum edges. Here is caution announced! But most of them will - as I disappear in a case, then it is absolutely no problem. ** Speed ​​** Undoubtedly a big plus on this iPhone. Websites are loaded very fast, the operation is more than fluent and everything you do with it just feels fast. If one compares an older iPhone or any other current smartphone one will notice a significant difference. Even a 4K video editing and exporting is faster than with many PC's .. ** Camera ** The 12 megapixel main camera makes in daylight very good and detailed photos. In twilight, it does not convince all along and of course, the resolution in 2019 could be higher, I had in 2015 a SonyZ3, which already had 20, x megapixels.The portrait function, which subsequently makes the background "out of focus", convinces me as a hobby photographer only partially. Cropping works only when a face is detected and in backlight portraits it quickly reaches its limits. There you can not see the hairs separated areas and small mistakes. In good light, the results are quite convincing. I would not have thought of this as a defender of "heavy glass" on the heavy camera. A real innovation is not, that could namely the said Sony Z3 already in 2015 - without a face would have been necessary, although by far not in the quality as the Xr.Was I really like, is the video function. You can film in 4K and 60fps with it! The recorded videos have a high degree of detail and convince all along the line. It should be kept in mind that the 64GB version is only partially suitable for this purpose, one minute of 4K 60fps material needs a whopping 400MB of storage space. ** Display ** Unfortunately, the pixel density is quite low compared to the competition. You should have chosen a slightly higher pixel density and everything would be fine, otherwise the display is really good. It is very very bright and quite stable in perspective. The thick edges around the display are not really disturbing and are only noticeable in a direct comparison if it is next to an Xs. The NightShift function is absolutely brilliant and spares the eyes noticeably. The transition from day / night on NightShift can be done automatically after sunrise and sunset. You get used to the display very fast and I do not miss the higher pixel density of the Xs models anymore. I had first set the function "" Display zoom "" to "" enlarged "", unfortunately, this letter is strong fringe and reduces the sharpness of this. If you switch to normal, text works much sharper! ** Battery ** The running time is excellent, even after several hours of phone calls followed by several hours of surfing and playing around the Xr evening even loose 50% and more residual charge. Even frequent users should loose their day, with me there are even two without completely discharging the battery. Very good! In conjunction with an Apple Watch Series 4, the battery life is slightly reduced, but there are still two days drin.Die charging time is as written before very long, but it is no problem at all, because the smartphone usually over anyway is charged at night - and it is even better if it is charged slowly to extend the life of the battery.** Qi charging function ** The Qi charging function is great, I use this with a 20-Euro Qi charging stand anchor, which charges the iPhone when depositing despite a 3-4mm thick shell easily. There's nothing else to keep in mind, it just works. ** Face ID ** For me, as a convert of a Touch ID iPhone, it's pure witchcraft. It works just perfect after the setup, which takes a minute. Whether in the day or in complete darkness, with or without a cap, it always unlocks and it does not annoy. The only downside to Touch ID - if it's at the table, you have to pick it up or pull it to unlock it. Of course you can also enter the unlock code, in a brief review what is but much more undecided than the old with Homebutton.Und sometimes it does not work if you yawn: -) ** Software ** iOS in version 12 is a very stable running and fast operating system, which is known to have some limitations in file transfer and data organization. I get along with it excellently, not least because it forms an unbeatable team in conjunction with an iMac and the data exchange and backup via iCloud. System updates come for years and are installed reliably (at night) without annoying. Some updates are somewhat hidden and can only be detected by trial and error, such as shaking the device to make a call, long press on the spacebar, the app updates are sometimes automatic and partly manual To move the cursor around the screen like a mousepad, long press elements in the control center to get additional options. The best are a few tips and tricks - Watch videos to find all the functions. Unfortunately, the keyboard is not as adaptive as the Google keyboard, but still very easy to use after a bit of familiarization. In iOS13, which comes in the fall of 2019, it should finally support the input through Swipe. That could be the above-mentioned Sony then already. ** Weight and size ** Especially when you come from a small smartphone, the dimensions are gigantic. I have only one pair of jeans in which the Xr fits into the front pockets. The best is to look at it and touch it! The weight is unfortunately very high, with the case it is well over 200 grams. I have never had such a heavy phone.Similar sized devices have an average of about 150 grams. Even my first "" mobile "", a huge Motorola with antenna from the year 2000 was much lighter than this chunk. In any case, one could open his walnuts at Christmas time, if one is too lazy to fetch the nutcracker from the kitchen. ** Audio and co. The voice quality is convincing, as is the reception on the phone. I was able to make calls only at one point in my apartment, now it is almost everywhere. The sound of the speakers is surprisingly good and voluminous and to watch videos absolutely sufficient. For listening to music, there are the supplied EarPods with Lightning plug, which sound good, but not more. Bluetooth connections to my speakers and headphones have a high range and are very stable. Unfortunately, the small Lightning has been saved on jack adapter and must now be purchased separately. The missing headphone jack is just a problem if you want to charge it at the same time and listen to music. CarPlay also works very well, everything is loaded and played quickly. The GPS reception during navigation is excellent. Siri also works reliably on my 2017 Skoda on the push of a button and is usually very useful for entering navigation destinations. I find these Animojis in iMessage very funny, which can be recorded via Face ID and even transmit audio. That's great fun - when people in the circle of friends also use a new generation iPhone. ** Conclusion ** It's hard, very fast, makes great videos, and has a modest display. The price is very high but in my opinion justified. In combination with a Mac and other Apple products, it is almost unbeatable.
6378	iPhone XR	128GB	White	HoKe	3	Chunky and unwieldy ...	2018-11-17	de	I got the XR from Apple delivered, unpacked, tried, packed again and sent back. Why, the XR 6.1 inch is too unwieldy for me and thus useless for my usage behavior. Why do smartphones have to be so huge and where with such a board, backpack ... The XR has some positive features, such as very high speed, battery life and a good LCD display. But to build an LCD display in a high-priced device, only Apple can do. The resolution can be argued, most users will be satisfied. In my preferred white, the XR does not look very high quality. The colorful versions may be for the younger generation, black smartphones do not appeal to me. Targeted buyers are probably the younger generation, but it's actually too expensive for that. A smaller, lighter and cheaper one ... maybe that would have been a success. It's nothing for me ... In the end, I chose an XS , Significantly more handy, high quality and equipped with a contemporary OLED display.
6379	iPhone XR	256GB	Black	Peter P.	5	Super	2018-12-31	de	Yes, APPLE is unfortunately not cheap. But very reliable. The Xr is incredibly fast and the display is great. The criticism of an LCD display, I can not understand. Could hardly find any differences to the OLEDs. OK if I take it close and take a magnifying glass and let me influence other opinions ... And the battery life is very positive !!!
6380	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Pit	4	.... bottom line good performance	2018-12-31	de	I switched from the iPhone 7 and must say .... there are worlds between the devices. Apart from the things to be expected ... speed, general performance ... Face ID works outstanding, the display is crisp, the battery life is very good, the wireless charging is very comfortable and the look is very appealing !! I first had to get used to the weight .... is in the direct comparison but much harder. Without a protective cover is a safe handling a bit tricky and the setup I had problems with the backup of my old device !? The device has hung up and it was ultimately only by a special software on .... have activated for years, various iPhone models, this was the hardest so far ....
6381	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Jürgen	1	Retrogression!	2019-01-19	de	I had already worried the XS and was shocked by the bad OLED display. That's why I got now the iPhone XR with old (new) Technik.TrueTone is off, brightness to 100%, Nightshift off. Again a yellow cast in the display as in the XS. The clarity has weakened a lot compared to the iPhone 7. Ergo Apple is now going the way of the best possible return at the expense of the Kunden.Ich Unfortunately, I can not understand how so many positive reviews about this Handyhier vorhanden.Natürlich I realize that this is the low-priced Version of the XS is, but here is then the better decision to buy an iPhone 7 or 8 ...... or to go to the competition, otherwise it will not understand Tim Cook with 13.7 million € salary.
6382	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Herr Mü-Zo	5	Complaints at a high level; Comparison XR and XS	2019-01-16	de	Unfortunately, I can not quite understand some other reviews .. Who plays with the idea to buy an iPhone, decides not only for a new cell phone from any manufacturer, but for its own system. I think the pros and cons This system is discussed in other comments or articles on the Internet too much and need not be repeated at this point large. For me, the main reasons why I have opted for an Apple device, that I use since the iPhone 4 Apple phones and always was satisfied with the devices! One knows his apps; can use the purchases from the app store and it just works! You do not have to install other apps for everything again because the player does not play a format or anything like that. I have an Apple TV at home and I think the system is very sophisticated. You can compare that a bit with the difference of a game console to a PC ; you just have to turn on the console and it works! On the PC, you may need to retrofit hardware, update drivers, make settings, etc. This often works in the bottom line, but is far less comfortable. An Apple phone is so convenient that you can, for example. after uploading a backup of the old phones at the web browser can easily read his open web pages, which you have read before och on the old device. Furthermore, for the devices even after years still offered updates and compared to other manufacturers (my wife uses Android ) one does not have the impression that the manufacturer brings a device on the market and then dedicates itself to the successor device and no large resources in the old device puts. This is a purely personal opinion and this can be self-educated! Whether someone uses Apple, should be left to each alone. Since I wanted to replace my Iphone 7 by a successor device from the house of Apple, I waited last autumn first on the new devices. With the presentation of this and in particular the new prices, one swallows as a loyal Apple -Customer already, although everyone is aware that with an Iphone, of course, "" the brand "" paid and not just a normal phone. In this respect, you can not compare apples with pears, that is, for a comparable price you get m.E. When comparing the pure technology values ​​a little less than the competition. I personally need more than 64GB of memory and was more than satisfied with my IPhone 7 with the 128 GB. In this respect, it had to be a device that has more than 64GB and here came only this Iphone XR with 128 GB or just an Iphone XS, but then directly with 256GB into consideration, since there are not the 128GB here. The Iphone XS Max, on the other hand, is just too big for me and far too expensive, so I faced the direct comparison of the XR and the XS.Also you have to look in direct comparison, if you can live with the disadvantages of the XR this mainly the limited camera, since this has only one lens, and just to call the worse display. The price: For my XR I paid 799, - €; The XS I have nowhere cheaper, as seen about 1080 ¬.Since my pain limit was 1000, - €, only the XR came into consideration and it was now the consideration of whether I should get this device at all, or rather one more year with the old device should be satisfied. To hope for that that a successor device from the house of Apple suddenly would be cheaper, in my opinion Utopian! Speaking of purchase price: For used Apple devices you still get quite good prices in resale. This can be considered in his purchase decision so synonymous zuZamera: According to my knowledge, is used in the double lens from Apple in a wide-angle mode and a optical zoom. Quite honestly: If I want to take great photos with an optical zoom, I grab the SLR camera ; their optical zoom is still far better than any cell phone! Why do I use the phone camera? Of course, because you always have the device with you and can take a picture of the children quickly or take something as a video kann.Und this is the camera (ie the existing wide-angle lens) very well suited! For me, the photos are completely sufficient and my compact camera (Canon Ixus) is already in the closet for years, because the mobile phone photos as a replacement are simply too good. In contrast to the Huawei device my wife (P10 with double lens from Leica) makes the camera synonymous with worse light conditions good pictures. So we always take my cell phone, when the light is not so great. But there is still one disadvantage: The portrait mode (bokeh effect), the iPhone can only simulate the camera software. Personally, it bothers me that you can not record objects with this software, only people (if they are not recognized, they do not want to use the effect). I can not imagine why this is technically the case, since the In portrait mode, surely with the tapping of an object, you could specify an area to be sharp while the rest is out of focus. To the display: Yes, I know that the display of the XR used is worse than that of the XS, but it always has still about the same quality as the display of the Iphone 7 or 8 (different size of the display and different resolution, but same pixel density). Therefore, I have juxtaposed and compared both devices in the Applestore. To be honest: Personally, I do see a small difference, if you keep them right next to each other and close, but that does not mean that the XR display is bad! If you want to see the difference, then you see it too; otherwise not! This is not decisive for me because it is still a good display. According to my information, the XS built-in display consumes more power, so the XR has the elegant advantage of keeping the battery longer Battery will definitely last longer than all previous ones! I've been using the same thing during the week for years, so a relatively good comparison is possible. I have never had a battery (even with new devices), which in the evening before the store is still at about 60%! To feel: The XR is slightly larger than the XS, but of course smaller than the XS Max.Für my hands, the size is optimal; but everyone should decide for themselves, if this should be crucial. The weight of a device has never bothered me; I can not understand such statements of other comments. Result: I do not regret the decision to buy the Iphone XR! You get a for Apple conditions (!!) cheap price a great phone! For me, the extra charge for an XS is not worth it and the old technology (skin processor of the Iphone X) I would not have if I buy a new device. The main processors XR, XS and XS Max are all identical and this is great. The missing homebutton was a small change for me, but then you get used to it quickly!
6383	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	StrammerMax	3	Only partially convinced	2019-03-06	de	I myself have the iPhone XS and have each got an iPhone XR for my parents. In general, I'm very convinced of the device, however, there are some restrictions in comparison to the XS, which bother me. The performance is identical thanks to the same processor (good). But especially in terms of the resolution, I'm disappointed. The fact that the screen is again larger than that of the XS and the resolution is significantly lower, you can see a clear difference. Especially in writing, the margins of the XR seem significantly blurred. Also with the picture quality one notices the missing second camera. In poorly lit rooms, my parents also had problems unlocking the device via Face ID. When you switch from Android to iOS, it's the missing "" back button that makes life difficult. Depending on the application, the arrow is down times, sometimes up, sometimes right, sometimes left .. that is sometimes really annoying.
6384	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Klaus Sch.	5	A little expensive but good	2018-12-12	de	Installation went quickly and smoothly. The acquisition of the predecessor phone was great. The new device was detected and all data and files were transferred to the new phone. XR was immediately ready for action.
6385	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Florian	5	First skeptical - now completely excited!	2019-02-21	de	iPhone XR / white / 64GBWhat's too big - yes, something sound - fantastic! Touch - unique! Phone calls - outstanding! Seriously, when the thing came I wanted to exchange it again and ordered directly the 8'er because it is simple and simple was too big, but after two days Ümgang so I'm just excited about the XR. And yes, 192g is not a lightweight compared to the 5SE used before. Nevertheless, after a few phone calls, the decision was firm - the XR is here and stays here. The display is brilliant and the sound of the speakers is a real poem for the ears. The battery keeps feeling eternal despite continuous use (mail, music, Internet, phone and so). In addition, the animated Emoje classes and one more, the thing is just sow fast! The slide functions perfect and the home button I miss now no longer, on the contrary, it almost bothers the other. With missing the CR and 3D touch I've never missed, the feel of touch is enough for me completely. Clear recommendation!
6386	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Metronom	4	Apple's stepchild? Still not bad	2019-03-14	de	I bought the XR in the store because I do not like to spend big sums on the internet. You've already heard a lot ... Now to the iPhone: I own it in white with 128GB memory. I am satisfied with the design and the size is great for me. The battery is great. I do a lot on the phone (play, YouTube, read) and the battery takes me through the day. It can be charged wirelessly or with a power adapter. The iPhone has enough power. No jerking, almost never a delay. Games can be played fluently. The display has been heavily criticized. I do not notice anything special. Anyone who is accustomed to an iphone 6s, 7,8, will not notice anything. Only from LCD to OLED you will see the difference, which is normal. This ranzoomen / zoom is total nonsense. Nobody sees the symbols on the display in normal use. Exactly as one could get excited about mites on the mattress. Photos are sharp in daylight. Great pictures are possible. In the dark, it lags behind something. Selfies are not bad, but it would be even better. The color representation is very natural. Face ID works fine at night in the dark. Of course you have to position the phone correctly and not keep it away from the face. Sometimes it still wants the code, such as after a reboot.Sound is great. Loud enough for me and the sound can be heard. Significantly better than the iPhone 7 for example. Who does not need the best from Apple, will be happy with this smartphone. IOS runs smoothly and the smartphone is a great all-rounder with slight flaws, but not a big one.
6387	iPhone XR	256GB	White	Helmut	5	Switch from Samsung S7 to Iphone	2019-06-17	de	So far, I had a Samsung S7, with which I was actually very satisfied. However, I was bothered by the ever longer intervals in which the updates come. So I decided to get a new smartphone. Meanwhile, the prices of the latest smartphones are very close together - at least in the upper price segment. The Samsung smartphone also disturbed me the enormous price decline after 2 years of holding. But the most important aspect for me was getting hardware and software from a single source. In the case of the Iphone, the software is designed just for this brand and is made by the Apple developers in-house, directly cut to the appropriate hardware. In Android, almost every manufacturer has different Android versions on their smartphones after 1-2 years. When dubbing the data on the new Iphone, I found that the data is sometimes on the GoogleCloud, then some again on the SamsungCloud. I like to have everything from a single source and completely coordinated. With Apple and the Iphone I just have a better feeling than with other providers. When I buy a new car, I take everything completely from the manufacturer in the new car and buy not only there the basic equipment and the rest of things in the accessories trade. For me, the security is a great asset and can only m. E. be guaranteed by a complete offer. Conclusion: after a short "" learning phase "" works great with the Iphone XR. And I felt a good sense of security. Incidentally, the price was also right on Amazon!
6388	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Brunofok	3	Too complicated to use 2 sim (e-sim)	2019-01-24	de	I was really excited that I could use 2 sim card on an iphone (my first iphone after several androids). But I realised only when it was delivered that 2 sim means actually 1 sim card and 1 digital sim (e-sim). At first it seemed even better than 2 real sim card, but it is too complicated to use e-sim. I spent hours googling how to use it and eventually need to go to Vodafone to see if I really can do it with a prepaid plan.
6389	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Amazon-Kunde	5	Not the best, but ...	2019-04-12	de	I would like to ask in advance, yes I am an Apple fan, but not blind or blinded. My transition was made by the iPhone 5s on the XR. The display is supposedly not as good as in other phones, that may be the direct comparison, for example. with the Xs / Xs max does not justify my extra price in my opinion. If one takes a current Samsung S or a Huawei eg. P30, the Xr looks a bit old-fashioned at first sight. But that does not bother me so much that the inner values ​​are really good. Face iD works absolutely fast and reliable. In normal use, the battery is enough for me 2 days. What I like well is the ability to use eSim so you can use for example an O2 and a Vodafone sim. There is even the possibility of the voice line of zb. O2 separate from the Vodafone data line. Direct parallel operation is not possible. The only drawback is the position of the keys, something that probably would not have happened under Steve Jobs. Since the loud and quiet keys are opposite the power button, it happens to me quite often that I unintentionally take a screenshot. Otherwise, I have nothing to complain about, a total of a very good overall package of hard and Software.Kaufempfehlung
6390	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Alexander	5	Great smartphone, only to be recommended	2019-01-06	de	I bought this smartphone for Christmas, because I've wanted one for a long time. It was about 80 ¬ cheaper than Apple, which is why I struck. The iPhone came 7 days earlier than predicted and it came in perfect original package. The camera is similar, as with the X, but one sees differences. With 64GB you are completely equipped, as these are totally sufficient. The iPhone is for all savers just a recommendation, as it is not really worse than the X and even bigger.
6391	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Thomas Cosler	5	Best iPhone at the moment. Giant battery	2019-04-23	de	The best iPhone today. With the display one sees no difference to the Xs even with direct comparison. But the battery lasts much longer. With weak use I get up to 3 days without battery charge.
6392	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Andreas S	5	Perfect device	2019-06-14	de	For my claims! Coming from the iPhone 7, the xr puts everything in the shade. After I gave my wife the xr in color red due to a display break of her iP 7 for Christmas and was allowed to play around with it a bit, for me it was clear: I have to have.I'm in the local Apple shop, I've looked at the individual "x-er" times and my original purchase decision überacht.Geplant was actually the purchase of the xs due to the supposedly superior display and the smaller Gehäuse.Klar, on the The amoled display is vastly superior to paper and in numerous YouTube videos. Black, resolution and contrast are of course great, but as with my previous Samsung S6, the parts also have their downsides, in the truest sense of the word. I do not like these discolorations at all white surfaces at different angles.For xs not nearly as bad as the Samsung, but still existing.Pen tile matrix, height resolution only on paper, so to speak for Poser.Das inferior Lc display I like better, yes everyone can see it differently.Face ID works perfectly like everything else and leaves nothing to my desires.Hab's me in red fetched in black it would have been more expensive. But is still the most beautiful color, a dark blue, yes unfortunately nicht.Grund for the change of the iP 7 was mainly the weakening battery, I'm looking forward to the perseverance of xr in everyday life. My wife is thrilled and invites her only every two days. The workmanship and the feel are Apple typical, know nothing better. I'm with the device so far very satisfied and can recommend the closer look and try each. LGAndreas
6393	iPhone XR	64GB	Yellow	Natalie Schmitt	5	Super!	2019-02-20	de	Who whines here, who spins ;-) the smartphone is absolutely great. I switched from the iPhone 7 to the XR and loved it without limit. Top boost, insane photos, great colors, great display. There is nothing to complain about! Any time.
6394	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Dushen C.	3	Good phone	2018-11-24	de	I ordered last week, and the price is 20€ cheaper now. The phone is brand-new and as good as it should be.
6395	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Dieter Matena	4	The completely satisfied everything!	2018-12-08	de	Everything is very good until today! The price performance ratio is good the delivery was also very good !!
6396	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Benjamin G.	4	iPhone XR	2019-04-05	de	Unfortunately, my device had a scratch on the aluminum frame as well as Bluetooth connection problems. Thanks to Amazon but a refund of the purchase price was not a problem. Other companies such as Media Markt are not as accommodating and correct as Amazon, but I have 5 stars. The XR is unfairly criticized. Yes, there are a few limitations with which you can live more than just good, since the canceled functions, not missing in everyday life. The battery of the XR is lonely top, with me the device held loose for 1.5 days despite intensive use. The display is great for a LC panel, as other manufacturers with the same display technology can not keep up. It's a bit bigger, yes, but in my opinion, despite the size, is still in the hand! This means that the device is a bit thicker you also have a better grip. All in all, for me, it's the best iPhone Apple has ever produced, because let's face it, who did not dream of owning an iPhone whose battery life is finally at its peak.
6397	iPhone XR	128GB	Blue	Thorsten	5	Outstanding smartphone	2019-05-26	de	If you first recovered from the Apple typical price shock has a great device! I can not even understand the criticisms of the display in the least. I am very satisfied with the quality and brightness! The workmanship is top what you can probably ask for the price. Another plus point is the IOS which needs a settling in, if you come from an Android phone, but then you are super satisfied and you would not want to miss it anymore! For me, the change from Android to Apple was worthwhile and was a pure joy. What was also an important point is the battery life and there is the Xr also world class in it! I would buy it anytime again!
6398	iPhone XR	128GB	Yellow	J.M.	5	Horny part!	2019-02-02	de	I have to say quite honestly, I am thrilled! Delivery was as always very fast, but was to be expected, I do not know otherwise from Amazon. The yellow is just so beautiful and in my opinion, for this iPhone the best color ever. The cell phone is without shell super in hand, so you could use it with one hand, as I had larger phones that were more cumbersome. Maybe that's why I can not share the opinion that it should be full. The size so perfect. FaceID works flawlessly and is just great! I had never had a cell phone which I could unlock as quickly and easily as das.Die data transfer from the old to the new cell phone was super easy of hand and was within 20 minutes about completely fertig.Ich it's only been a few hours and I am so in love. I can recommend it to everyone! Here was written in advance so much about the phone that I have nothing more to say. Top and all the thumbs up!
6399	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Arno Sonnen	5	Great device!	2019-01-21	de	Great part. Have fun working with it. Lies well in the hand and has all the advantages of networking with my other Apple products. Outstanding are the long battery life, face recognition instead of fingerprint and the extremely fast response time.
6400	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Bibi	5	Apple just ...	2019-01-03	de	Am still completely satisfied after a few weeks of use. It makes great photos and the display is also ok and nice and big. Inductive charging also works with standard equipment, with which one can also load the competing products. The color selection is lush and the rich red is beautiful. I have not dived into the water and will avoid that. The abandonment of the home button is easy to get over and Face-ID works mostly. Thumbs up - I did not expect anything more!
6401	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Isa Potter.	5	I am absolutely thrilled!	2019-04-09	de	At first I had my doubts, whether the purchase on Amazon is a good idea, because I found it very strange that the price here was a lot cheaper than the directly over Apple. But I've been using this iPhone XR for a few months now and I'm absolutely thrilled! There is nothing to complain about, the phone came very quickly in my original packaging and works perfectly. Very clear purchase recommendation!
6402	iPhone XR	128GB	Yellow	Amazon Kunde	5	Impressive!	2019-03-12	de	Great thing! My first iPhone, I switched from Andoid. Anyone who sees a slightly overpriced product to buy, the expected top quality. Despite the relatively low resolution, the display beats the competition in terms of brilliance by far. I personally like the color of the Xr even a little more than that of the Xs. The functionality of iOS over Andoid is also awesome. Of course not recommended for modders. Otherwise, you get what you expect for the price too.
6403	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Alex	5	Mobile super, Amazon packaging pathetic.	2019-01-20	de	After I switched to iOS with the 5s 6 years ago and I also tried out current Android devices, I wanted to get an iPhone again despite the prices. Although I could afford it, I do not see 4-digit amounts for a cell phone and am also completely satisfied with the XR. The display, which is often seen as the biggest drawback, despite the resolution is absolutely satisfactory for a LCD. The rest, there are enough tests and after I had the Xr in my hand, I would not know why I would have 300+ euros for an Xs I would buy it anytime again. But what I have to get rid of is the way it was sent from Amazon. The phone was thrown into a box and sent. No packaging material - nothing. Absolutely unacceptable to send a product for 800 euros and save on any type of upholstery for 10 cents. The box was already slightly dented on the outside and if the iPhone packaging even the slightest bruise by shipping could be seen, I would have sent it back. Shipping as always fast, but that was the last cell phone that I bought at Amazon .Da because it is the product, I do not deduct a star, but only for the display resolution (even if the best LCD) and of a good price-performance ratio, you can not speak, but who buys an iPhone , knows that before.
6404	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Marcel	5	iPhone XR	2019-03-07	de	First: Switch from a OnePlus 5t (Android) because broken. Super simple cell phone and a pleasant size. I have previously been largely informed and am very happy with the features of the iPhone. In the subject of display resolution, I had thought I'm going back to something worse, but in everyday life, I notice nothing. The camera is synonymous top. In terms of security, the iPhone is worlds better than Android. My conclusion so far Top cell phone and super system interface.
6405	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Julian Regensburger	5	I think it's great!	2019-03-28	de	I have now ordered the Xr and have tested it often before and looked good. That it is not exactly like the Xs is clear to me and that has also been said several times by Apple and I do not understand the 1 star recessions since it is enough for everyday life and it also makes very nice pictures. Sure the LCD panel is not as good as the OLED but it does not bother me at all. The price is still too high for me but on the whole a very nice and great smartphone that is also very good in the hand!
6406	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Carlotta	5	Positively surprised!	2019-03-26	de	Previously I had the iPhone 6s and then decided to buy a new phone after over 3.5 years. At first I thought the iPhone XR would be smaller and was a bit surprised when I opened and unpacked the package. However, I'm positively surprised because I thought I never want a bigger phone than the iPhone 6s. You quickly get used to the size and also to the new operation without Homebutton. I like to take pictures and am absolutely satisfied with the picture quality. I can only recommend the iPhone XR. The only sticking point with Apple are leather prices but compared to the iPhone XS, the iPhone XR is a good "" cheaper "" alternative.
6407	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	Amazon Kunde	5	Top device! Best alternative to the iPhone X and XS!	2019-05-10	de	I opted for the XR because I did not see nearly 500, - Euro more spend for the X. I have had the iPhone 6 so far and deliberately skipped a few generations. It was worth it. The price of 729, - at Amazon convinced and was 120, - Euro below the list price (64GB). I got lost for the blue version because I was slowly fed up with black and silver. It is a really nice, Edelbert blue tone on the aluminum frame. The phone gets but still a Schutzhülle.Einrichtung was super Easy without cable connection. All data was taken over perfectly. I say top and recommend the product at any time!
6408	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Steve--	4	Typical IPhone ...	2019-03-17	de	I am very satisfied with this device, if one is worth the money, one is not badly served here. Before buying necessarily reviews on Youtube ansehen- I can only recommend. Maybe a different model is enough, these are still usable at the moment. Personally, I would have liked to buy a renewal of the iPhone SE, unfortunately this is not (yet?) Not on the market. The pros and cons are shown well in most YouTube reviews and visually beautiful presented, as I could here. I would like to complete here only that the speakers are very good. Unfortunately, the audio jack is still not back and an adapter is not included. The adapter from Apple currently costs ~ 8 €, with the price of the IPhone you could settle the quiet. When using the original adapter but you can not charge at the same time. There are 2 in 1 adapter, but if they can bring the same quality but I can not say yet ... you should consider it anyway. The size is for me just so in the frame.
6409	iPhone XR	256GB	Red	Amazon Kunde	5	The number 1 of the IPhones!	2019-01-01	de	Great, the best iphone I've ever had.
6410	iPhone XR	256GB	Yellow	Amazon-Kunde	5	Almost everything fits here	2019-05-04	de	Picture quality, also in comparison to the XS, good. Price / performance, at least after the price reductions, my own still appropriate.Einziger serious criticism for me - very smooth. I immediately got a transparent silicone cover (although I really do not like cover at all). But without slipping the part of any smooth surface, or even out of hand.
6411	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Stievmama	5	Best Handy ever battery life is sensational!	2019-02-20	de	I do not want to write much on the phone. Have it since Christmas and am extremely satisfied, I have it in red and I like it really well. Have not regretted the switch from Samsung Galaxy one second! Simple operation extremely good battery, enough 3 days although I have since I own the phone it much use.
6412	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Melanie Merkl	5	Top Smartphone!	2019-02-03	de	First and foremost - Friday evening ordered, Saturday afternoon delivered - I'm really excited! Now to the topic: I switched from the iPhone 8 to the XR. At first I was skeptical; I have relatively small hands and thus the fear that I could have my problems with so much of it. But that is actually not so, I get along well with the size of the iPhone. The display is great, the camera makes great pictures and Face ID works optimally (even so I had my doubts). So far I have nothing to complain about and can unreservedly recommend!
6413	iPhone XR	256GB	Yellow	*Einfach*Nici*	5	Great phone, nice color, huge display	2019-02-04	de	I am very satisfied! My favorite color is yellow now I finally found my matching mobile phone. I had the iPhone 7 before. Of course it's a huge difference, just for the big one. I love Faceid everything works fine even in the dark. With the battery, I can easily through the day that was not the case with the 7th. More than satisfied that I have decided on this phone :-)
6414	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Max Jainta	5	iPhone at a fair price	2019-04-07	de	An awesome part! It should be self-evident that a 850 Euro expensive mobile phone has no sharp edges and in the hand does not feel like a gadget from the gumball machine, just because there are two more expensive X-versions in the smartphone triumvirate. Here you do not have to worry about the iPhone XR. Apple's most affordable iPhone is built with the utmost care and boasts a high-quality feel and fine details. With a 6.1-inch format, the iPhone XR fits between the iPhone X and the iPhone XS Max. In everyday life, it can often, but not always with one hand. The also made of glass back supports wireless charging, but is prone to fingerprints.First conclusion: The cheapest iPhone is actually as noble as the iPhone XS. Due to the colors and the colored frame, it is even a little fancier for some people.
6415	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	MrGung	4	Good smartphone but too expensive.	2019-03-19	de	I bought this smartphone because the Homebutton has suddenly given up its services on my iPhone 6s and I thought that it was time again to get a bit more on the current side of the technology. Basically, I am very satisfied with the iPhone XR.Which getting used to a device without Homebutton at first something took some getting used to - the Face ID thing really works great. The battery is also very good in comparison. In heavy use, there is no need to be charged during the day. That no longer has a jack plug Personally, I find it terrible. In addition, not even a Lightning mini jack adapter is included. Instead, headphones are included with Lightninganschluss.Eine not understandable decision. The price is set too high to my taste. Especially when you consider that the iPhone XR is now the cheapest Apple-made iPhone. And I was by no means willing to spend over 1,000, - € for an iPhone XS or XS Max.
6416	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Familie G aus B-S	5	Happy daughter - happy parents	2019-06-14	de	There is probably not much to say - fast delivery, good quality, the child has a newer model than the parents and is soulful ... the school and homework are still not neglected, especially the large display and that on this model new incoming messages pointed out but not parts of the text to be displayed is great.
6417	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Sascha Zienert	5	Expensive but good	2019-04-14	de	A review is a personal opinion. I already had some I Phones and got one again. Actually, I wanted to take another smartphone because an Apple is very expensive. After using another phone for a year, I bought the XR and am really happy to have an I Phone again. It's just like that Apple is always Apple. I do not want to miss it anymore. If you like it will agree with me who not not. For my needs and applications, it is always enough (as it would have done a cheaper).
6418	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Julian Müller	5	A great device with minimal restrictions	2019-02-20	de	The iPhone XR is a great device, super processed, ultra-fast, has a very good battery, makes realistic and sharp photos and is simply an Apple device. The quality is just extremely good. The display is good, but not quite as colorful as the OLED displays. Still, I would definitely buy it again. After all, this increases the battery performance and videos should not look anyway on such small displays.
6419	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Joyjoy	3	A Nice smart phone but ...	2019-04-18	de	The Camera is top, the Foto is really nature and the Color is  convinced. But the Browser Speed is not so fast and smooth as android phones, really a short coming.

6422	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Jack Daniels	5	I would buy again	2019-06-16	de	The best IPhone I ever had. The battery keeps loose for 2 days with me. The photos are very good, everything runs smoothly and without dropouts, the display is great (I can not understand the partially voiced criticism), everything sharp and rich in contrast. The price is high, of course, but the performance too. Clear Buy recommendation

Amazon dealer	2019-05-31	de	Yes top cell phone but the price drops even more .. topical, original iPhone product you should beat as long as it is possible ... who wants to have a good cell phone should treat it and it only 1 year warranty benefits and not two years if you buy it directly through Apple ..

One minus the part is compared to Android phones still a bit expensive, 100-200 would be less fair.
6431	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Andre Reichel	5	Top Product	2019-06-06	de	Who knows the iPhone does not want anything else. Top device, quick to set up. Only the price always deters something. Since I use my IPhones over 5 years relativize this

6524	iPhone XR	64GB	White	jannek007	5	Highly recommended	2018-11-30	de	I purchased the XR with 64GB per contract extension and I'm thrilled with the device ever since. I do not want to stretch the review, the Specs are known. The fact is that the phone gives a very high quality and noble impression. I think it's nice that the displays are now color-independent in black. The processing is great and everything is placed as usual except for the sim card slot, which now sits further down. About the display and its resolution is and was a lot of barking, absolutely unnecessary and unobjective. It is very pleasant to look at it, resolution totally ok and adequate. More is not really necessary as the human eye has its limits. The longer the battery life. I come with normal use on 2 days. The XR has stereo speakers and they sound very full and even with noticeable or audible bass. Software is as good as usual and consistently fast and should receive about 5 years of updates. Face ID works perfectly and puts you in a good mood. The main camera takes very good pictures and is the iPhone X in spite of only one lens in no way. Otherwise .... Wireless charging works well, size of the phone is borderline but just ok. In summary, a perfect all-rounder. The iPhone also seems to be relatively scratch-resistant. Use it without sheath and without bulletproof glass. The aluminum frame is better suited than the stainless steel frame of the X or XS. Only the price is typically very high Apple but in a few months, the part should be around for the 700 ¬ werden.Klare recommendation on my part.

6528	iPhone XR	128GB	Coral	C.Pfuhler	5	iPhone XR 128 GB (Coral)	2018-12-04	de	First of all: I got my iPhone XR in the Apple Store. I do not understand all the reviews here about the iPhone XR? This is now my third iPhone within 6 years. My last one was an iPhone 6S with 64GB. I had the iPhone 6S 3 1/2 years long. And then I decided to pick that iPhone XR. The first reason why I chose this iPhone is because I do not always swim with the crowd want. I did not want to have a phone which everyone has. Then I think it's great that there is now Face-ID instead of the Home Button. Handy is unlocked in seconds. Then the color: I like the color really well. It looks really classy and she does what. Then to the size of the iPhone: it is clear at the beginning it is unusual to have a 6.1 inch (15.5 cm in the diagonal) display. My iPhone 6s had 4.7 inches (11.94 inches in diagonal) you can tell it's a big difference. Nevertheless, I find that it is very comfortable in the hand that an iPhone XR, where I have not the biggest hand !!!! To the camera: I find the camera just the first cream. Better than my old one. I'm always fascinated what great photos can come out of it, if you take the time, and deals with the camera. For the battery life: with normal use, it creates a runtime of two days. (Have only been three weeks) To top it all off: I am completely satisfied with the iPhone XR. And would recommend it anytime.
6529	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	5	Detailed review	2019-02-26	de	First of all, I got the iPhone XR at the Apple Store in Munich, as I was able to exchange my old 7s for a credit of 250 €. Thus I have for the XR "" only "" paid 600 €. I will try to organize my review as clearly as possible.1. Display - the biggest criticism: Why is the display so criticized? Clearly for 850 €, a 4k display or at least Full HD display must be installed. Or? Not quite. The display is absolutely sharp and has earned no negative criticism in my eyes. You often see that the testers zoom as close as possible to the screen with the eye or the camera in order to guess a few pixels. This shows me that the alleged problem with the display is purely psychological.2. Battery - the biggest selling pointThe battery of the iPhone XR is really sensational for an iPhone. For a Samsung, rather average. 2 full days without charging the phone is no problem. In this respect, absolutely fine.3. HardwareThree gigabytes of RAM (memory) sounds in comparison with the competition like Samsung (Apple is always compared with Samsung, but you can take any other manufacturer) miserably little. In fact, 3GB of RAM is not just enough, but most phones have 8GB of RAM. Why? The iOS operating system is perfectly tailored to the device. While Android has to run on any mobile, iOS only has to run on iPhones. This means that the hardware and software are so perfectly matched that iPhones run much faster with much less technology than the competition. The processing of the housing is of course impeccable, as always. Not to say, absolutely perfect. As a port for data transfer and charging, a Lightning port, which I personally personally prefer a thousand times, serves as a shaky USB Type-C port. And juhu, inductive charging is also thanks to the glass back :) Incidentally, the "" thick "" display margins only relevant for the first 5 minutes, then you can not see them anymore.At first I thought that they would disturb me a lot, but as I said, after 5 minutes they were forgotten.4. SoftwareWho wonders why iPhones and the rest of Apple is always so expensive, has never thought about the software. In addition to Pages, Keynote and Numbers (Apple's counterpart to Word, Powerpoint and Excel), which are FULLY FREE, it offers years of free updates. At that time I always had Android phones and they were no longer supplied with updates after 2 years at the latest. And if you have ever tried to make a full backup of an Android phone, you know why Apple is ahead in terms of software! Value for moneyHello Apple ?! Are you crazy ?! 850 € for the part? That's how I thought at the beginning. Thankfully, my love of technology won and I bought the XR anyway. After a few days of use and playing around, I came to the conclusion that the iPhone XR is worth every penny! Above all, if one knows the abnormally high resale value of Apple products. Glass Glass, Spiderapp! The XR not only has front glass installed, but also rear. What does that mean? Right. Silicon case and bulletproof screen protectors are required.7. The color selection I stood in the Apple Store for almost 45 minutes and had no plan which color to buy. In the end, it has turned yellow and I'm not sorry, thank God. BUT: look at the colors before in real, because these are much stronger in the pictures. In real, the colors look rather washed out, but still nice.8. Purchase recommendation A buy recommendation is on my part definitely. This device will certainly be my companion for the next 4 years and will perform its job excellently. Camera top, display top, battery top, software top, design top. Price performance grade 1.6.
6530	iPhone XR	256GB	Red	Wotke	5	A red cell phone was always my dream!	2019-03-21	de	Well, I do not understand the reviews on the phone at all. The predecessor of the XR was a 7+. I wanted to cry because I sold it and read some of the XR's "" modest "" reviews before it arrived. First of all, I want to see something on my phone! That it Navi, video player etc. is. As above, I had the 7+, the size, I do not complain about it, in any way, I do not feel unwieldy. Comfortable gazing without guessing, even if you do not have glasses at once, you can see something. I had to bridge 14 days with the iPhone 4S ..., then I appreciate the screen size again correctly! I thought I expected a lesser quality ... The screen is crisp, sharp, fine - I do not know where I should put the point of criticism ... I have been working with Apple displays in many variations since 2005. So I still respected enhanced on the screen quality with the XR. She is awesome ... The battery life is brilliant, fantastically long. The camera very fine! The speakers - I no longer rumble JBL, I use the iPhone speakers right away. Face ID wonderful, I do not miss the homebutton. For me, the XR is just as great as the 7+, only with modern technology. The XS is too small compared to the XR, the XS max much too big, because I can do the same take an iPad. XS and XS max with the same settings as the XR looked as if the Night Shift was turned on. The best screen for me was the XR. So I am a happy iPhone XR owner!
6531	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Janine Seifert	1	Switch from Android to Iphone not possible	2019-02-06	de	Well, what can I say, I have a Sony Experia XZ Compact. I sat for almost two days now on the XR to transfer my data. It just can not be done even with this one Great transfer app, I get nothing from my Sony rueber.I will certainly not every single contact, apps ect. Manuel set up. Unfortunately it was an attempt that failed.
6532	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Amazon Kunde	5	Photos are wonderful	2018-12-25	de	I like to make photos
6533	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	Heartbreaker19	4	Very nice mobile	2019-02-27	de	I find the processing of the I Phone XR very good. Feels very well too. For that it has only 1 camera, the pictures are great. But unfortunately the phone is too heavy and just too thick. I am Apple fan by u. by. Nothing else comes to my house. And I think the price - performance ratio for the iPhone XR top. The X / XS / XM are far too expensive and worth their price in any case. Get an XR and let go of the more expensive devices. They are not worth it. The XR does everything it should. I hope I could help you.?!
6534	iPhone XR	128GB	Coral	Amazon Kunde	4	Forget the overpriced XS !!	2019-01-11	de	I'll make it short.Display: great !!!, our today's spoiled youth should be an ophthalmologist, I see neither a blurred nor pixelated display! (I'm 38!) Performance: As always Apple typically flawless! Battery: wow !! No comparison to my after 2 weeks resold and very disappointing i phone XS.Has full 2 ​​days with intensive use! Price still ok for me, but could still be 100 ¬ cheaper, but so what, who wants quality must stop paying more ,
6535	iPhone XR	256GB	Yellow	Knusperkopp	5	IPhone XR - the perfect alternative to the iPhone X (and maybe the XS)	2019-06-08	de	First of all, I have not purchased the iPhone XR (yellow, 256 GB) via Amazon. I have the device now a good 3 months in use and think that I now have enough experience to objectively evaluate the device. I had before the XR an iPhone X, which I have sold because of the poor battery life, however. This is also a huge advantage of the XR over the X called. I use my smartphone on average a lot, a bit messaging, mailing, surfing, shopping, rarely even a game. The iPhone calls an average display time of about 1.5 hours per day.When used, the XR needs to be recharged every 3-4 days. My X had in new condition every 1.5 days to the power - with the same usage. Of course - the longer battery life is also due to the supposedly "worse" display. But is the display really bad? I do not think so, because there are some advantages: Unlike the X (S), the XR does not have an OLED, but a cheaper LCD display (the technology behind this is Apple's Liquid Retina ). This is reflected in the resolution - at least on paper - noticeable: While the two current XS devices with 458 pixels per inch (ppi) provide much sharper view, remains the XR with its pixel density of 326 ppi, almost at the level of its predecessor iPhone 8. In everyday life, this is absolutely not on. In direct comparison with an XS, so you lay the iPhone side by side, yes, there you see the difference. The black levels of the top model does not reach the XR and the contrasts in poor lighting are less clear, BUT in strong sunlight is the display of the XR For me, the display of the iPhone XR is absolutely sufficient and the thick edges disturb me in the smallest way. The often criticized "clunkiness" I feel rather than positive. I have the XR, as mentioned, bought as a successor to my X and am completely satisfied. In the end, everyone has to decide for themselves whether the "benefits" of the XS an extra charge of around EUR 300. I deliberately opted for the XR because it offers the best price / performance ratio (Apple) for my personal requirements and I have no regrets. The photos of the XR are absolutely great, the battery life is excellent and who can do without 3D Touch , is in my view with the XR in the Apple World in excellent hands. From me an absolute buy recommendation.
6536	iPhone XR	64GB	White	C&M	5	I'm excited!	2019-03-27	de	I bought the iphone for just over 700 €. I chose Apple because the latest models from Samsung and Huawei have actually been more expensive. The iPhone 8 Plus would have been more expensive. So much for the price in comparison to the competition with similarly strong devices. First of all: I am more than satisfied with my decision. The smartphone is processed typically outstanding Apple. Although has a decent weight, but is like a piece - very high quality! Also, the 6.1 inches of the screen are for me rather a plus rather than a minus point. I had a 5.5 inch phone before. Logically, the screen is larger, but the device itself is smaller than my previous one. It fits well in the hand and can be operated with one hand. I think the size, for me at least, just right. Also that one uses now the complete screen and the Homebutton is gone is super. The much discussed display goes in my opinion completely in order. Somewhere, just to the big brother money had to be saved. Of course, I would have preferred synonymous rather oled, but still this is a reasonable display. Everything is very nicely presented, has great colors and is bright enough. In my opinion the best thing about the XR is the camera. Although I have not done so much so far, but what I have seen was consistently outstanding. Quite great photos - of course, rich in detail, beautiful colors, but not too much of the good as with other manufacturers of the case. The portrait mode really makes very nice pictures and also the video quality is impressive. The most ingenious thing about the whole thing is: what others do not get baked at five, gets the XR out with a single lens. That just has to be embarrassing for one or the other. What just made me a little disappointed was the speakers. But even here I have not been able to test extensively. So far they have not been "round" enough for me. Although okay and stereo, but not as loud and clear as I expected, or the quality decreases with increasing volume. But it is quite different with headphones. This is really an experience - comparable to a visit to the cinema. Even at high volume flawless, it's really fun to hear about the things music or watching movies. Another plus is the battery. He is holding and holding and holding and just will not get empty. Here you have done a really good job. The battery was not even half full and I judge and test since yesterday constantly - he still shows over 20%. Conclusion: Nothing on the phone is really bad. Everything moves between good and very good and I'm really positively surprised what the stripped-down X version can do. With this huge price difference, clear buy recommendation from me.
6537	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Mik217	2	From iPhone 6s to XR? D rather not!	2019-04-29	de	First of all to me iPhone 4, iPhone 6s- Usable features: One-hand mode by double tap, 3D touch, Touch ID, opening the camera via control center, power saving mode permanently on.- large hands- Most used apps: Snapchat, Whatsapp, Facebook , Instagram, various games, news appsPlus: ++ Design, case size, weight +++ operation + touch ID criticism at 6s: --- very low battery life (at least 2x load a day) (now 77% battery power, but power-saving mode always on + Stromfresser like Bluetooth and Wlan switched off on the way) - screen size too small- speed, resolution, camera not up-to-date (but personally I do not find sooo annoying) - soon no more updatesThese annoying problems have moved me to pick up a new model for some years now One day I had the iPhone XR in use and can say the following things (not purchased on Amazon) ++ Battery life top (very much use: games, Bluetooth and WLAN perma nent on, rumprobieren, etc.) and had 10h use still 40% + speed: the apps open much faster, and the display recognizes the inputs much faster. + Of course, the camera is better than my old 6s + color and optics (Back side): the matt aluminum frame and the darker black look very good. + I did not miss the 3D touch as the haptic touch covers 90% of the functions. But now on the negative aspects: first, the ones that bother me less: - Design (front): The Notch I personally do not like, if I hold the XR transversely to watch videos. The thick edge makes the iPhone appear a bit cheap in my opinion - I personally like the fingerprint sensor better than Face-ID, since you always have to raise the phone to unlock.- The cases for the XR on Amazon are so thick that of there can be no question of transparency. Very thick, milky and make the iPhone additionally unhandlicher.Nun to the annoying stuff in my view- As I have already mentioned very large hands, but I consider the XR including sleeve with one hand to use as catastrophic. It's heavy (weight), with the thumb you can never reach the top edge (open control center) and activate the one-hand mode (with a wiper down) does not always work or quit alone before you could perform an action (especially in Snapchat conspicuous) - I have a constant feeling it falls out of my hand.- The low resolution compared to the Xs or X (pretty much the same price) does not justify the high price. Conclusion: After a day, the XR migrated without signs of wear and polished back, because immediately shell and protective film were attached. Even if the display is nice and big, the camera / speaker notch reduces the feeling. The most important thing with my smartphone is a simple and fast operation with mostly one hand. That was impossible with the XR. For such a price, I expect more. In some places you can still notice that the software has not quite adapted to the notch. Furthermore, I personally miss the home button, due to the one-hand mode. And with hindsight I could have dealt with Assistive Touch. And maybe that's just my impression, but somehow the display seemed cheap. I like to use my iPhone 6s and am a fan of the operating system. I now have some concerns about an X model (due to much better battery life, updates and better resolution). Since the X is smaller than the XR, I think the handling will also be easier. Unfortunately, the XR failed with me.
6538	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Daimpi	2	You should think carefully before buying!	2019-04-09	de	Also I did not get the device from Amazon. It was traded to me as a new service phone against an iPhone 6S. Many have already described the technical details here. I would rather comment on the size, handling and feel. Unfortunately, I had no influence on the choice of my new device. The phone is very big. Way too big for average big / small hands. Even in inhand mode, I find it hard to reach the upper left corner. I've been used to using the phone with one hand for years. The XR is a torment. Also, the weight is a disaster. If you put the phone in a bumper, it gets even bigger and heavier. Writing an e-mail is very tiring for the hand. Absolutely unusable. The change from Touch-ID to Face-ID was a bit hard to get used to. But over time, I find it not so bad. The case itself is processed properly. But the sides of the phone are very slippery, so you have to spend a lot of power on a cell phone, so it does not slip through your fingers. The heavy weight is still counterproductive added. If I could, I would send it back immediately.
6539	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	namenlos	1	Always the same	2019-04-19	de	Now it's over. The XR is now my fourth iPhone. In addition, I own / also had an iPod, an iPad and a MacBook Air. After I was initially excited, I'm just just fed up. It starts with the fact that I pay 850 € for nothing new. And it goes on to say that the XR is a telephone booth. And why in the new version of iTunes you can no longer manually load songs from the PC to the iPhone without splitting the albums into individual songs? It's just backward and weak. I never buy an Apple product again.
6540	iPhone XR	64GB	White	thomas borchers	5	Simply great	2019-04-19	de	I chose the iPhone XR as the successor to my Galaxy S8 because I was dissatisfied with Android System. I do not regret the change after nearly 3 weeks. The battery life which was very important to me is paramount and the whole performance is just a dream. I can tell everyone about a change only to the heart.
6541	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	ein kunde aus düsseldorf	3	I was forced	2019-06-01	de	As a long-time satisfied user of Asian budget smartphones, I was forced by my employer to buy this device due to "changed mobile standards". Dual SIM had to be on hold. Compared to my last cell phone, an almost historic Honor 4x, the much better Kamara and the very fluently running software stand out positively. Negative is the fairly high weight and - for me serious - miserable dictation function. Professionally, I am forced to dictate extensive texts in the worst specialist gibberish, which was not a problem at all with the Honor - and a Samsung Tablet used for comparison - quasi out of box. Unfortunately, the expensive iPhone only produces absolute garbage. Everyday language, of course also garnished with elements from the consumer and media world, runs great. At the moment I'm hoping for the system's ability to learn, but I'm skeptical.
6542	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Amazon Kunde	5	From Android to iPhone	2019-06-18	de	I have only used Android so far (Samsung S2 and A5 2015) and found it pretty well - except for the updates. They did not exist. Android is cheaper, but the updates justify the extra cost of Apple. To the iPhone XR: The screen is great, the battery lasts a long time (three days with 2 hours of screen usage per day). The photos are very good, whereby I take the really important photos with the SLR. The size is o. K., Although it could be smaller and lighter. But you arrange yourself. The utility value is very high, the phone just works just reliable, without stuttering, good apps. I do not know if I switch back to Android, only if the update policy gets better.
6543	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Jochen M	5	Perfect appeal	2019-05-08	de	I did not buy this iphone from Amazon this time but from Saturn. I have followed the recommendation of Stiftung Warentest and have never regretted this. I thought OK You'll be disappointed and then you want the XS but it was not like that. The screen is bright and the letters are sharp. The camera is great. Videos a dream and using the included software to edit immediately. The battery lasts 2 days with me (I do not have it that much in my hand) The phone never crashes thanks to the OS software !!!! I am thrilled and surely there is not something for everyone. Because it is expensive. But if you have the opportunity to acquire it anyway, you can resell it super one day. The screen is big enough for games and movies. I do not get a cent for this review.
6544	iPhone XR	128GB	White	C. Fischer	4	Completely satisfied	2019-06-23	de	Of course, the price is not exactly low. In view of the more expensive iPhone models, however, this has everything the average Joe needs. I bought this a few months ago, because the performance of Pokémon Go on the iPhone 6 is extremely unsatisfactory. On the XR, the game is now much better and what is the best: the battery life is really great. I can walk around the area and catch Pokémons for hours without a power bank! A few words to the camera: if you take pictures every now and then, the camera is beyond reproach. Of course, the XS offers more features, but if you take photos professionally, a cell phone should not be your first choice. So, if you do not have the highest standards, but you insist on a fast iPhone, this one is well-advised.
6545	iPhone XR	256GB	Black	Robin	5	The best of the best in the smartphone sector	2019-05-07	de	This is in my opinion the best currently available smartphone on the market. Have it been in use for 4 months and everything is true, except that since the update, the battery life has decreased, there is nothing to complain about. The best cell phone I have so far , the price should give you something to think about..clearly. But otherwise you do not do anything wrong with the purchase of the iPhone XR
6546	iPhone XR	128GB	White	LeKiki	4	I am happy.	2019-02-03	de	I switched from my 6s to the iPhone XR with 128GB. And I have to say that I am very satisfied. What bothers me is that when I turn off my display, I always take a screenshot, because I'm on the loud, quiet rocker: (The battery keeps loose all day and the display is not synonymous negative to me at the most notch yet but the synonymous only in certain apps.The edge does not bother me at all I have to say.All in all, I regret the purchase nicht.Die image quality of the photos in the dim light, however, is very bad .In my opinion Or, the photos are printed out (you have to test) neat.
6547	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Amazon Kunde	5	Do not be fooled by pixel numbers.	2019-06-14	de	I am already a longtime Apple customer, the switch from my Iphone 7 to the XR was definitely very good. I own the phone now since 31.10.2018, which still amazes me, is the battery, this holds CLEARLY longer than the Iphone 7 and was the main reason for the change. Compared to my even older Iphone 6 I would even say, the battery lasts more than twice as long. Furthermore, I am very convinced of the phone boxes, these are really extremely loud for a cell phone and it I really enjoy using my phone very much to watch videos, which is why a cell phone in this size is very suitable for me, you have to know of course what you use your cell phone, but people the small cell phones prefer such as the Iphone SE, rather wait a bit I think this is not optimal for you. The Bildqulität is normal, now not overly better or worse than be i other Iphones, who is satisfied with the resolution of the Iphone 8, it will be absolutely synonymous with the XR. According to the technical data, the display offers a "too low" resolution on which all Apple hater fall naturally like the vulture around the phone bad to talk. Here you have to say very clearly, PEOPLE do not let you influence this anti-apple propaganda, the phone has a very very good screen, everything looks great even if it can not keep up with the number of pixels with other phones, vlt numbers In tests where people were presented with 2 taped cell phone displays, one of which was the Iphone Xr, all were totally thrilled. It is physically proven that you can only see at a distance of 30 cm from Eye to display differences in resolution can detect, and each user has his cellphone in normal use not less than 30cm in front of the face, because it does not matter whether the pixel number 1 00 times as high.
6548	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Sam	5	Fast and enduring	2019-01-29	de	Have the phone over my provider. I would still like to describe my impression. The mobile phone is perfectly processed. The display is excellent despite all the doom calls. It is wonderfully readable and perfectly usable even in bright sunshine. The speed is outstanding. The camera makes top photos. but as Ottonormal I'm completely thrilled. If you do not want Android anymore, the XR is a real alternative.
6549	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Dalyan Unland	4	Great device, small review	2019-01-04	de	Hello, my opinion on the iPhone XR is very two-part. The device meets my requirements for a compact device by making a very good impression with the thin display edges and high resolution. With the glass back it fits well in the hand, but is sometimes prone to catching scratches. The device has a nice long battery life and the screen is used very well, since only a small notch for camera etc. is at the top. Face ID recognizes the face with glasses or, for example, in the dark. However, despite all these facts, I think that the device is not for everyone, because the price line ratio is not good in my opinion. The device does not offer more than an iPhone 8 Plus. Only externally and a few small unimportant features change something. Greetings

Performance, battery and the camera are just awesome. The pixel density I personally find much too low for a smartphone in 2019. But I do not mind. The 3D face recognition works without problems and is very fast. I can recommend the smartphone even if you have to do without some features such as the 3D Touch

At first I had the feeling that the display is not that dissolving. But you get used to it and after a time is quite good. It could be a bit narrower. But otherwise it does what it should. Battery power and just a great sound quality, because the S9 could not keep up. Without my contract extension I would not have bought it. A good solid phone.

6560	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Friesenjung	4	BETTER THAN EXPECTED	2018-11-18	de	Here is a short and crisp review of the new Apple iPhone XR. Relative to the called price of currently about 800 € (64 GB version) arise for me the following pros and cons camera: 7 MP front camera with f / 2.2 (identical to the Xs); Main camera with 12 MP and f / 1.8 (also identical to Xs, but no dual camera), good portraits with single camera possible, good image sharpness, good color fastness and dynamics, low-light performance OK (can the Huawei P20 Pro or Mate 20 Pro but much better), great videos with up to 4k and 60 fps performance and software: Apple A12 processor with 3 GB Ram (Xs has identical processor but 1 GB more RAM), iOS 12 (also identical except for missing 3D touch) , great performance in all respects, practical gesture control processing and feel: a bit thicker than the S models, but with just under 200g but still good in the hand, good buttons, glass back in 6 different color battery: 2942 mAh capacity are good about 7 hours of display-on-time and thus 1-1.5 days runtime additional features: wireless charging, stereo speakers, Face-ID (fast, reliable and relatively secure), practical mute switch, IP certification (but only IP67 ) Neutral 6.1 inch LCD display with only 1792 * 828 pixels (326 ppi - as in the blissful iPhone 4), visible in direct comparison discernible sharpness difference to Xs, in everyday life, it is relatively rare; good color reproduction and brightness, relatively thick edges and great Notch price performance: For Apple products you always pay a hefty surcharge; who accepts this, gets the Xr better price performance than the Xs (see Conclusion) Minus jack connection, no expandable memory, Dual Sim only via eSIM, no Schell Ladeetzteil and no jack adapter with in the box The iPhone XR offers for at least 300 euros less in common with the big siblings. So the processor is at least very similar to the Xs and camera, design and additional features. The biggest difference lies in the display (in particular the resolution). So if you want an iPhone, get the best value for money in the current Apple iPhone cosmos. For me, this results in a total of 4 Sterne.Meine personal Amazon rating matrix: * Expected in all respects; ** missed on some points; *** Expectations met; **** exceeded expectations in some points; ***** Exceeded expectations in all points should this review have been helpful, I would be very happy about a click on the "Useful" button!
6561	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	D. Meier	5	Very satisfied with the iPhone Xr	2018-11-13	de	I buy a new smartphone at least once a year. Last year I had an iPhone X, meanwhile a huawei p20 pro and now an iPhone Xr in blue. I made the purchase via Telekom and am so far very satisfied. It seems to me a very good iPhone to be a fair price compared to the other Xs and Xs Max. The display is, in spite of all bad reviews, completely ok, but in no case bad. Sure, the iPhone X is sharper and more brilliant. But the display of the Xr is good enough. Who says it was bad, it has not had in the hand, no idea or just goes to the data sheet. The camera is great, the general performance without jerking and without long waiting times. The battery is awesome. I use my smartphones very intensively and have between 30 and 50% after one day. For skeptics: I'm a techie and do not get any money for this recession. I wrote it freely.
6562	iPhone XR	128GB	White	G. Föhr	5	Highly Recommended	2018-12-14	de	I switched from the iPhone 7 and had last year already considered, which I should take. The change to 8 would hardly have paid off. The X I found for what it is clearly too expensive. My ideas were: 64gb memory too low, slightly larger display, with one hand still operable, a very good camera, technically sufficient for the next few years and ultimately, if possible, a slightly better Battery life. I was lucky and was able to test the iPhone XR, X and XS for a few days each. After that it was clear, it will definitely be the XR. It is certainly a matter of opinion, I had the Galaxy S7 in front of the iPhone and thus know the Amoled Display years ago. For this I have to say, however, that I've missed it already at 7 in the smallest way. I think the LCD panel is even more comfortable for the eye. My reasons for the XR were in the end more versatile as thought.- for me the size is right and even if it weighs a few grams more, it's still lighter like the 8plus and also a little bit smaller (I can handle it with one hand) - I am not bothered by the slightly wider margin (will not bother anyone who did not have the X before) - very good camera (even in the evening if it is a bit worse light) - ultra fast and fluid in the operation faceID is not so used to get used to as the XR and felt a bit faster than the X- the battery life is by far the best I could ever reach with a smartphone 128gb memory offers no other current iPhone - at least 300 euros extra charge in my eyes, not the purchase an XS-not as vulnerable as the XSThe negative arguments are therefore limited: - no 3DTouch (but is partially replaced by Haptictouch- altogether t is a little too expensive but still worth its money. In summary, it can be said that ein has brought a really good smartphone on the market here, which in my opinion, the premium devices in many ways nachsteht.Von me because of a whole clear buy recommendation.
6563	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Kunde	5	Top Smartphone!	2019-01-11	de	Honestly, I had reservations before buying because the display was criticized because it has a smaller pixel density than the Iphone Xs and Xs Max. However, I have dared to buy and found that the display resolution is more than adequate! That part has the best LCD display what Apple has ever installed in a smartphone. Now, some are wondering why I prefer the Xr to the X. I have decided so because Oled displays tend to einbrennen.Da I the device about 5 years (Apple's update policy is thanks), my decision fell on the XR and I have not looked back! In addition, the battery life is phenomenal, I can easily get through the day (Facebook, whatsapp, Netflix, Games ect!) For these reasons I highly recommend this device, especially because it "only" costs € 795 instead of € 850 (as of 11.1.2019). And I stress it here again: If you are still worried about the display resolution, please test the device on site and you'll see how ridiculous the whole "hate" against the display is. Best regardsA happy iPhone user
6564	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	myfine	4	Love of hate ... through and through	2018-11-25	de	The xr is not a self-runner, not everybodys darling! I'm torn! I'm from the 6th ..., slim lightweight phone, even with a sheath a flatterer through and through. That was the first disappointment with xr, it's so heavy and really chunky. From the 6th is a harsh conversion. The xr is neither a hand nor a trouser pocket flatterer. (It should be noted, I am small and technically have rather children's hands) Protects it with shell, wear it again. Slim design is missing. But once you get used to the size, it impresses in so many ways. The display, the colors, omg the camera - top! What pictures and videos - great! The battery: unbeatable! - the thickness of the phone was used really positive here! Easy two days with normal use! I've never experienced that at Apple before. It seems to me very insensitive, the AluRand personally I like much better than the stainless steel edge at xs and xs Max. Performance top! Screen size just right. Sound / volume convincing. I've often thought, maybe you would rather switch to xs ... but I am shuddered by the price above all the much shorter battery life. I really do not want to do without it. Rarely have I been so ambivalent about a cell phone. I have not really arrived at the xr, but somehow I do not want to miss or give it away.
6565	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Joel N.	5	Very good phone, but is just Apple	2018-12-30	de	The Dislpay is very good in my opinion, the battery is great! The price is not justified, okay, but Apple phones are just luxury goods, such as. a Mercedes AMG, because you can argue with the price also. I have to say that I'm not an "Apple fanboy", because it is my 1st iPhone. The change from Android to IOS was unfortunately difficult.P.S. Please do not buy apps to transfer contacts. One can add in the attitudes and the point "accounts" its Google account and then the contacts are also transferred. I can only recommend the Handy, it is really great.
6566	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Daniel F.	3	Long-term test for the XR 128GB matte black	2018-12-14	de	I've done the work here and once to write a detailed review after a good 5 months of use. The review I have divided into advantages, disadvantages and applications in which the XR all other Apple phones clearly in the Vorteil.Ich starts at this point times with the disadvantages or weaknesses of the XR. Probably the biggest weakness of the XR is the display, you can hear from all sides. My subjective impression would say the device has about Full HD resolution. Which in my opinion would be too little even with 6.1 inches. But that is also because I, as many other previously had displays, the higher resolution. For me, for example, Note 4 Iphoen 6S Plus, s7, Iphone X.Zudem is also the processing is anything but good. In the matt black model, the black paint flakes off the edge. And with the X / XS / Max it was of course super smart of Apple to use chrome in a commodity. Thus, no matter which iPhone you get, you will always be upset on the Displayrahmen.Ein another disadvantage is the camera, this is the original main cam from the XS, however, without a second lens. That is, there is no optical zoom which is really good in many modes. If you are a bit further away, for example, in nature, you have really no good photos, because the objects are too far away. The digital zoom is an absolute disaster. Here at this point I want to make clear again that the Huawei Honor 8X 249 ¬ costs and has a pretty good camera incl Dualcam. So with 849 € RRP, it would have been definitely feasible. The waiver of 3D Touch ebnefalls is a mistake. That even the cheap not Plus models like, Iphone 6s, 7, 8. All have 3D Touch. And all the same UVP.Na this point, Apple wants the customers "verapplen". And a software Haptictouch will never replace a 3D Touch. Let's put it briefly together, -Displayauflösung slightly blatantly stripped-processing or material selection definitely missed camera only conditionally usable-Nebei still 1 GB less Ram.-no 3D Touch despite 849 € UVPNow we come to the advantagesAnd here I start again at the display, no I'm not schizophrenic, yes, the display has just great benefits. The contrast is outstanding except for the black level. Also, the brightness is just great. The colors are not too glaring as with many OLEDs and still brilliant.As far as these values ​​are concerned, it is again premium. The battery of the XR is the best one can imagine in an Iphone. It lasts really long even with intensive use you get over the day. With middle use are also 1.5 days in it. Since Apple has really made a sufficiently large battery available. Of course, I also think it's good to block the powerful A12 Bionic. And I have to say that the A11 would have done it. The service is Apple typically buttery soft. So far, there is no Android device that runs so soft. The front camera is the same as in the XS / Max models including all functions and Bekeheffekten.Zusamengefasst: -Displayhelligkeit, colors and contrast are outstandingly good and in terms of these areas it is the best LCD on The battery is just great and has a really labge run-A12 Bionic-Butterweiche operation-the front camera was taken over by the XS / Max 1: 1This phone is made for the following people, people who work mainly with the front camera.Leute the take no nature shots and need a visual zoom. All the previously only the normal and not plus models or had a high resolution such as. Samsung's S, Note series or other Hersteller.Leute where a good battery life is important and necessarily want an Iphone. Conclusion: Yes, after 5 months, I see the phone with a laughing and a crying eye. It is neither fish nor meat. The XR has In my view, enormous advantages and disadvantages. The profit maximization of Apple is really on the cookie. But there is another reason why Apple has slimmed the XR so far. The XS as well as the Max would sell then no more. And everyone who pursues the news on tech sites knows the Apple has suffered heavy losses in the area XS / Max. For many, 1249 € (XS 256) and 1349 (Max 256) are easy too much. The 64GB version could have been saved on a premium model. If you extrapolate this to an average net salary in Germany of ~ 1700 €, 1249 € are simply too much. From 2012 to date, the smartphone prices have more than doubled.Galaxy S2 € 499 Iphone 4S € 549.At this point, although I think IOS great, I have to say that one should better dodge other manufacturers such as Xiaomi or Huawei / Honor. Unless one is not like me Updategeil and his Icloud photos, etc. fully up to the top. For everything else is best to wait until September when the Iphone 11 comes.
6567	iPhone XR	256GB	Black	UN	5	Very ambiguous, but still clear recommendation!	2018-12-06	de	The iPhone XR is a very special Apple iPhone. It accomplishes a few technical masterpieces in the balancing act. At the beginning, it was difficult to judge whether to reject or accept it. The technical specifications are known, the corresponding meaningless discussions also, so that they are completely superfluous. It is a very good large 6.1 inch smartphone weighing just under 200 grams. Therefore, it is a smartphone for two-handed operation. There is the so-called "one-hand mode" in the accessibility, which can be additionally switched on. This helps only conditionally, since not all apps are currently adapted to the new iPhone design. I've spent far too long trying to come up with pros and cons to help me make the purchase decision before buying the iPhone XR. This approach has clearly failed, in the end it was predominantly an emotional purchase and Apple's marketing concept is fully on my mind. I took a close look at the iPhone XR and checked that it fits well in your hand and that it still fits in your pocket with its size. Furthermore, I compared the Liquid Retina Display with the displays of the iPhone XS, XS Max and the X to test whether the LC display is noticeably worse than the OLED displays of the other iPhones. Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that the difference is marginal and plays only a minor role in day-to-day operations. If one compares the XR to the XS and XS Max, the price differences and orders of magnitude have been decisive in order to favor the XR. If I compare the XR with the X, the main differences here are the dualsim support and the really good stereo sound for the XR. Who hangs on the OLED display, that said that the OLED displays are mostly supplied by Samsung and therefore probably the mark-up is correspondingly high. Furthermore, the problem with the OLED burn-in is still not solved technically, so that nobody can guarantee that after a long time the OLED displays will not cause any problems. iOS is maintained and updated by Apple for an average of five years per device generation. For a smartphone in this price range, I'm not ready to take that risk. If OLED smartphone then any model, which definitely does not last longer than two years. This is one of the technical advantages of the LC display of the XR, because these displays can not burn.Where is the real advantage of OLED to LC? There is a bit more color spectrum than pure sRGB, something from the DC3 range. It's still a smartphone and not a TV or home theater replacement. Now on the subject of no Full HD: Apple has never followed the usual industry standards for its iPhones, so why should you do it now? The X, XS and XS Max also do not conform to any standard but exceed it. Apple has finally finally applied its iPhone concept to the XR again. The human eye can no longer detect individual pixels, with a PPI value of over 300. Thus, the iPhone XR does not look blurred. Technically, smartphones with 8K displays would be possible today. But this is completely superfluous because the human eye can no longer detect a difference. Furthermore, each pixel requires power, so the battery life would be correspondingly short on an 8K display. The iPhone XR has the brightest display and the longest battery life of the entire X series. If you criticize the number of pixels of the LC display compared to the OLEDs, you should continue to use the term "Pentilematrix". For reasons of cost, the Samsung OLEDs have only two subpixels per pixel, and the LC display of the XR has three subpixels. Another aspect for the XR could be the lower number of pixels to be controlled in future, because the A12 has to spend less computing power on the XR than the higher number of pixels of the OLEDs. If you complain about the thicker edge of the XR screen, let's say that Apple has done an absolute pioneering job with its suppliers. No other smartphone has so far been fitted with an LC display with such a narrow edge. Long story short, the iPhone XR is a very good and appreciated smartphone. Is it worth the price? In view of the technical pioneering work and the advanced, but still quite perfected features clearly yes. The XR is said to be more robust than the other X-iPhones. Are there any negative aspects? Definitely! The iPhone XR is really comfortable to use only with two hands. The chic glass back ensures that the iPhone XR slips down the slightest slope, so you have to be very careful with it and at best always use a protective cover.
6568	iPhone XR	256GB	Yellow	Dirk	5	the color is awesome	2019-02-26	de	The iPhone was a lot cheaper in the yellow color than e.g. in black. Here I got the yellow with 256 GB for the price of a black with 128 GB. In hindsight, I have to say that the color is really great. So, let's compare the prices between different colors, sp uSU u.U. save some more or more memory for the money. To the iPhone itself, there is not much to say, the performance limitations compared to the model X are acceptable and justify the price difference
6569	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Matthias	5	Everything as expected	2019-01-01	de	One informs oneself in advance of a purchase and with this information, the phone is as expected. Just a real iPhone with the usual advantages of iOS. The camera is a clear step in the picture quality compared to the previous iPhone 6. Face ID is new and works perfectly smoothly. Battery life also seems much better.
6570	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	tom einsteller	5	iPhone XR	2019-02-04	de	So I am absolutely thrilled. Fast delivery via Amazon. Had a 7er before and am now switched to the XR. Handling super. Image quality, I think is perfectly fine, Face ID works great. Can not find anything negative and I have deliberately opted for the XR. I am an average consumer and I am thrilled. Apple costs, you should be aware of that. I would decide again.
6571	iPhone XR	128GB	Coral	Dennis	5	Coral more beautiful than expected	2019-01-03	de	I do not want to comment on the iPhone XR here. There are countless informative reviews. Clearly the price is never worth 5 stars at Apple, but that does not hurt the device. I want to express myself here primarily to the color. Coral uses my wife. It always looked a bit "" pink "" or pink on pictures, but in fact it looks like we are a pastel orange. Very nice indeed. The aluminum frame has a bit of the rose gold of the known devices. I'm surprised how good it looks. It's (in my opinion) not just a woman's color.
6572	iPhone XR	256GB	Red	Aya	2	Display deficient	2019-01-07	de	I had to sink the iPhone XR back in less than 2 weeks, as it came under the glass of the display to scratches / hairlines. Also, the on and off button did not respond as desired. For the price of such a device should not have such defects. Also you can find on the subject of display already entries in the Apple Forum. The problem was already in the Xer and there it ignored Apple at the beginning and dismissed.
6573	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Musikfan	4	A battery miracle	2019-01-07	de	After using a SAMSUNG S7 I'm back to the iPhone. I was satisfied with the Korean product, I did not like iPhones 6, 7 and 8. On a new with Apple ... Actually everything the same: A strictly shielded system, since Android was easier to maintain. But Google is not mine. Operation, quality and optics are good, except for the above camera. Face ID works great. The battery life is extremely good!
6574	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Amazon Kunde	5	Apple halt	2019-04-25	de	Had tried a Mi Note7, came with the software but not well. Before, I had an iPhone 5S. Switched on, installed in 5 minutes, flawless. Fast delivery, well packed, original. Everything as it should be. Of course, playing in a different league than the 5S. Am thrilled.
6575	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	MR	5	Very satisfied	2019-06-29	de	The XR is already expensive, but in my experience with the iPhone 4 (is still used today - with the first battery) and the 6S plus (is also still used), I assume that this XR will accompany me for many years and it already pays off. The quality and reliability I just love! For my purposes the 64 GB are enough - the 6S plus has 128 GB, but I did not need it at any time.
6576	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Philipp B	5	Better than expected	2019-01-27	de	Hello, After a long time I decided to buy the IPhone XR. At the beginning I had the slightly wider edge compared to the XS very disturbed but I have to say, you get used to it quickly. On the whole, I find it very successful even if the price of 777 ¬ for my feelings but is very high, but that is one now (unfortunately) used by Apple.
6577	iPhone XR	256GB	Black	sebibob	5	You do not need more IPhone.	2019-06-10	de	A cool device. I come from an SE. Initially, it has been unusual to operate a much larger device. But after days, it is more like the SE acts like a toy. Face ID is really great. Thousand times better than Touch ID, which is great too. I bought the XR with 256 GB for 889 Euro here on Amazon. One week later, they ask for 979. I probably got the perfect time.
6578	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Audionymous	5	Just genius	2019-03-23	de	Have been a long time iPhone user, since the 3G and it was better for each model. I have it in red and I love the design! It looks so awesome that you can not keep your eyes off. Display is great and not worthy of the bad reviews. The size is perfect and the weight synonymous ok. Can recommend it unreservedly. Did it get for 770 ¬ with 64GB. At the moment it is more expensive again.
6579	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Simone F.	5	Very nice iPhone !!!	2018-12-31	de	The iPhone XR is just great. Had a few predecessors, but the size is just awesome! I am very satisfied. And a big compliment to Amazon, delivery super fast, great!
6580	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	nsk81	3	unfortunately not mine ... good smartphone, but not for the price.	2019-03-12	de	No rating with Pro's and Kontra's, the phone itself is not bad, but I did not like the display at all. White is more gray, black is mediocre; Of course, contrast and colors are not outstanding. The resolution is mediocre, the writing is sufficiently sharp, color depth, color gradient mediocre, personal opinion. The comparison at home with XS ...... I prefer to pay 200 € on it. Conclusion: My opinion - € 399 and for the people, which the display is not that important. There is nothing on the Iphone that justifies the price of 849 €. Neither fish nor meat.

Device was cheaper on Amazon than Apple. Activation by face recognition is convenient. Have my Iphone also used for online identification via Postident.
6583	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	2	Disappointing except for the operating system.	2019-03-02	de	Worst display I've ever seen in a smartphone in this price range. Have times on the Samsung Galaxy S7 parallel to Xr run a video. The S7 is much better. The black value of the Xr is ridiculous. Other manufacturers make that much better. Amoled makes it possible. Too bad, because I find the operating system Umschlagbar and the quality is also true. Iphone XR is most likely going back. Ahja, the camera I think synonymous not necessarily good.

Actually, I like it quite well, but I have to harvest a lot of mockery and malice for it. Many colleagues and friends laugh at me about the device and ask if I have no money for a real iPhone? To be honest, it looks stupid if all their expensive and high-quality iPhone Xs or Xs max put on the table and I have to put my cheap phone next to it, usually I keep it in the bag so that no one sees it, of course it is stupid if it is but rings and everyone sees that I have only the cheap part. So my tip: put the part on vibration! Then you can with each call to weigh if you get it out and give you the nakedness, or not. I'm actually fully satisfied, the display is great, the working speed is a dream, the design is just great and it makes great photos. If it had simply made Apple 400-500 euros more expensive, then I would not have these problems with it. When renewing the contract I was also not clear that I do not get the expensive flagship, I have the Telekk chalk! You just had to tell me that it is the cheap device. So my tip: think twice if you can live with the pressure of society, if you get such a cheap device!
6607	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Jack	1	What I do not like about Apple	2019-01-21	de	the devices may be good and nice, but the backwards compatibility of the apps leaves much to be desired. Apss, which were installed about 2 years ago, can no longer be used. The developers can not expect it to adapt 3-4 times a year their program. Has Apple ever heard of a compatibility mode? Now I'm sitting on countless apps that are no longer running. THANK YOU APPLE! Not a single penny will you see more of me.
6608	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Alexander Winter	5	From the 8th to the XR / subjective as objective	2019-04-12	de	I decided to switch from the iPhone 8 to the XR. The following reasons: - bigger display - better battery-FaceID (I think it's great and always works somehow!) - gesture control Subject: iOS is still running smoothly, which is one of the reasons why I use Apple. It's a round system that works and is easy to use. Android is nothing for me after several attempts. Therefore, the price is justified, but everyone has to decide for themselves. My iPad Air from 2015 runs until today with much use absolutely smoothly. That does not create an Android ... is just so! The display is great, period. There will always be something that looks better on paper. My mother-in-law has a grade 9 and said yesterday that the display on my XR looks really great. So much for the delusion of YouTube experts. The display is bright and just as good as the iPhone 8's. And by the way ... all Tablets, whether iPad or Galaxy Tab etc, have a ppi of less than 300 ... and no one complains about it, quite the contrary! The battery is the absolute crucial point for me. Even with very intensive use, the battery lasts one and a half days. I do not need to say more about that. :-) Otherwise ... processing, telephone quality, network reception, quality of the photos ... as usual simply very good and completely sufficient! The gesture control goes into the blood after 5 minutes and you do not want anything else! (I also have it on my S9 + under Android 9 ... you can not compare with each other!) What I do not like so much: - the device is a bit unwieldy and heavier compared to the iPhone 8 - there is no original leather cover the notch takes some getting used to - Haptic touch is just not 3D touch, but you get used to it quickly - many or all users / creators always praise the black value of OLED panels ... I would not deny that. But no one mentions the white value ... that's a catastrophe in OLED's eyes and has much more weight than the black value. I do not know any OLED panel where the white balance is good. The LCD is really clean and knows how it should be. Therefore I emfinde a LCD like that of the iPhone XR, or 8, yes even that of the iPod always better than similar panels from Samsung, Huawei or the screen of the X / XS ... Objectively considered: - for the price, the display ( purely on paper) can tolerate a higher pixel density (Full HD) - 5.8 inches would have done it - generally the price (but where I always have to mention that everyone has to decide for themselves) Summa Summarum is the device perfect for me: not too big, not too small, great software and hardware, super camera, no stuttering, terrific battery, bright and clear display, update policy, security!
6609	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	A. Kemp	5	Winner of the heart	2019-01-19	de	I switched from an iPhone X to XR. I'll keep it short: it's one of my absolute favorite iPhones. I'm not interested in the "numbers" on paper regarding resolution ect. Only decisive for me is the everyday test. For me, the XR makes better photos than any other iPhone I've ever had. The size is for me a sweet spot between the Plus and the Xer. Absolutely smooth operation and reaction in the Altag, stereo recording in videos, and simply the best value for money an iPhone in my view. (Although it is still "expensive" compared to other manufacturers). From me as a longtime iPhone owner a clear buy recommendation.
6610	iPhone XR	128GB	Yellow	Bobby Marlene	5	Akkuwunder	2018-12-30	de	Had the 6'er for four years. Of course, the XR is superior to the 6'er in everything and not a step back. But it is also much bigger and heavier than the 6'er but also as the current X and XS.Habe quite big hands, but I can get used to it very quickly or my initial skepticism regarding size and weight in a timely manner. black border "" on the display does not bother me in the least, but I'm also in this regard. relatively relaxed or no peacock counter. But what makes me sick of the socks is the battery. I never expected that. Bsp.:Fr. 9h taken from the charging cable, used in my wake up the whole time with short Tel., Mails, I-Net, Whatts App, Youtube etc. plus 4h. 11h still 12% Akku.Es is something of unusual - but also relaxed, in the morning with only 50% battery out of the house to go and know that lasts for the whole day, if not enough until the next morning.
6611	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Uwe Lehmann	5	Very satisfied	2018-12-12	de	I bought the variant 128gb Product Red. However, not on Amazon, but 1day after publication in an electronics market. To my surprise, they had a lot of equipment on site, while a Mate 20 Pro was probably sold out fixed. Well, good. Current quality problems (display) when Mate show yes, the hype is not always good. Now for the XR.Yes I did not pre-order, because I wanted to watch the display live. This was however ratz fatz. I come from the iPhone 6 and feel the "restrictions" of the 326ppi as irrelevant. For comparison: My friend had an S7 Edge with 1440 pixels on the short side ... To save battery but she has chosen the setting 720p .... What strikes one from the iPhone 6 ... BATTERY. The battery life has felt doubled. Did I used to paddle on the couch with a tablet, I can now do it with the iPhone, without seeing the percentage tumble. SizeYes the XR is bigger and heavier (felt twice as heavy). But the transition from my mini Android phone to the iPhone 6 seemed to me more difficult. Meanwhile, the pockets of jeans are probably just bigger ... I got used to it very quickly. CameraIn good lighting conditions, the iPhone 6 has already taken good pictures. Since the quality of the images of the XR is already a corner better, but nothing that is why you have to change. In our apartment (a bit dark), however, the differences are very clear. While the iPhone 6 was just barely able to deliver something useful, the pictures of the XR are really great. Portrait Mode: Class. Although with errors, but is just calculated and no DSLR. Although I have no comparison to the XS, but I think I prefer the camera of the XR because of the much brighter lens with the portraits are shot. I justify my opinion with a comparison of the S9 plus, which makes portraits with a F2.4 lens and submits Murx in poorer lighting conditions. Therefore: I am fully satisfied ... the price would not be. I have already expected the nicely, since earlier the plus devices with Apple were even more expensive. An iPhone 7/8 was not out of the question, because I did not want to spend 500-600Eus for a phone that looks no different than my iPhone 6 and in everyday life so much more does not offer, as well as my iPhone 6 was still running ,
6612	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	T.S.	1	More Pleasant Apple Fan	2019-04-09	de	In a nutshell: The technique of this device is the lowest cannon. I switched from an ip7s to the xr and am still disappointed 4 months after purchase. The disappointment is also getting bigger, the more software problems are added. Where should I start ? Face ID: she does not recognize me when it is too dark, when the phone is too far away from the face or when I wear sunglasses. Too: is feeling worse than from the 7s, many movements and gestures are barely or not recognized Incidentally, this device has no more 3D touch, where I think with the flashlight function you could have used this well here ... pity Resolution: if a friend shows me samsung for 150 ¬ less, sometimes I could just cry. I use and I can only warn at the moment !!! Apple says it was due to the software, but already for 3 months? Very often, one of the two Sim's.his disabled, there are no calls or text messages' But as long as you do not want to send or dial out via this number, you just do not notice it and wonder why nobody answers. The reception is still displayed normally, so there is no way to be aware of it , When the device restarts the problem is fixed. The first month everything worked and since the 2 month I have to restart the device every 2-3 days.
6613	iPhone XR	64GB	Coral	Wilfried Fux	5	A big leap for me	2019-03-18	de	I had the last 2 years the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s in use and have due to the high price, the change to the XR longer considered, but now vollzogen.Kleich right away: YES the device is larger and - no na - also "" heavier "", but that does not bother me! After all, there are enough ways to gain a haptic impression before making a purchase. The display convinced me first in the branch of a large electric chain and now in operation at home and on the road. Of course it is not comparable to the big brother XS, but if you want a better display, you just have to buy the more expensive device. What I like very much are the following things: the cameras, the stereo sound (so you even The possibility of wireless charging and face ID as a logical successor to TouchID. All in all - for me, the device is an absolute gain and I find nothing for me to complain. And as I said: If I had wanted to buy an absolute high-end device, my choice would have been the XS. I can not do anything with the androids, alone because of the possibility of a COMPLETE backup without somehow having to fumble with the software of the device or the confusing settings in my opinion. This is also a matter of taste and I have no interest here any iOS. Android debates to kick off.
6614	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Christof	3	Change from 6 Plus to XR	2019-06-11	de	Since with each operating system update my 6 plus became ever slower, I decided after 4 years just to renew the telephone again. Since the other iPhones were too expensive and the XR street price slowly attractively, my choice on a XR with 64GB fallen. Compared to the 6 plus I noticed not only improvements. Negative against 6 plus: - Screen clearly worse, lower contrast and duller colors, poorer resolution / area - GPS bad. I really mean that. All the iPhones I have had an outstanding GPS that works really reliably. Not so the XR, in difficult environments, the positioning works fast by 50m inaccurately.- Battery: Holds the same use in the XR about 2 days, my 4 year old battery in 6 Plus Slight deterioration, v.a. in the 5Ghz BandPositiv The motivation to change. Yes, everything is much faster, subjectively even faster than my iPad Pro 10.5. INGENIOUS! - Face ID: Significant improvement to Touch ID. For me it works much faster, more reliable and more comfortable than Touch ID compass is more reliable. I do not know exactly what the R after the X means, but I suspect it's a ratio. There are definitely cheaper components installed. But I have already penetrated too far into the Apple world, to accept the loss of comfort of an Android phones. The conversion old -> new was altogether extremely easy, meanwhile Apple's philosophy is very easy to make my money really worth it. With the negative points I can live, GPS still bothers me the most. It is a good iPhone, but certainly not as advertised by Apple in many things your best !!!
6615	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Kunde aus Darmstadt	2	Way too expensive. Unusable in the dark	2019-06-22	de	I have the iPhone XR now about half a year and will sell it again. Very annoying is that there is no fingerprint scanner, the unlocking by face recognition works well during the day, but is often times at night on the road is completely unusable. Further annoying is completely uncharacteristic of Apple, that the device hangs often times, this observation have made acquaintances of mine, who also own the device.
6616	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Michael Beck	2	Unfortunately only mediocre	2019-02-19	de	Wanted to switch from Samsung to Apple, but unfortunately that was a step backwards. The low resolution of the display, "just" neat photos and the battery life could make my old Samsung S8 much better. You pay dearly for a mediocre product with technology and innovations that other manufacturers have had for a long time.

6622	iPhone XR	128GB	Red	Dieter M.	4	Support and quality does not fit the price, on the 2nd try everything well ...	2018-11-29	de	I had disconnections from the beginning when telephoning. Often after 2 seconds. Go through the entire guide with support (until you reset to factory settings and replace the SIM card). These experiments took 3 weeks. Everything was unsuccessful ... Then I was told, the device must be returned, a direct exchange was rejected. In summary: For over € 1000 received a device that has never functional. And now I should wait two weeks for the repair. So my personal Apple experiment was unfortunately not successful! 1 star! Next Episode: The Apple Store in Hanover has spotted. The ladies quickly understood that everything went pretty stupid and have exchanged the phone for a new one.I can now call! For now it stays at 3 points, in 4 weeks there may be more ... Can say after 2 months now : I do not give my XR anymore! Yes, it is heavy and big, but it gives such a high quality impression that it is always a pleasure to take it in hand (and to all who complain about it: size and weight are on the pack !!!). Functionally I can only report good. Here are just two examples: Face-ID is a poem, the battery capacity is a dream. An expensive piece of jewelry that is just fun! For 5 stars, the start was too bumpy ...

6625	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	CarolinF.	1	IPhone XR, XS or XS Max ??	2019-07-03	de	Hello people:) I think it's really good that you here so much reinschreiben:) I had considered to buy either the IPhone XR, IPhone XS or the iPhone XS Max .. I have until now the iPhone 8Plus! What is really great :), but I would rather another .. the newer, the better:) I have now read a lot of "bad" about the iPhone XR & I think, then I'll love the iPhone XS Max, IPhone XS I think that's out of the question, because the processing should not be so good and because it's smaller than my iphone 8Plus. And I love big phones! What would you recommend? Which of the 3's? Please only give some tips that have the respective IPhones :) that would help me the most !! I would buy the iPhone and not here in Germany, but in Switzerland:) To some cheaper, of course, connects one then with a holiday :) or rather the other way round: Please ask for tips. (Ratings are not correct, because I have to enter something to write here)

6629	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Anonymus	1	Top smartphone, gruesome phone, performance strange	2019-07-04	de	I try to keep it short and sweet. The smartphone itself is great. Valuable processed. Display on my part completely sufficient, performance impeccable and service also great. I come from the Galaxy S8 myself and was a little disappointed with Samsung's battery packs as well as the abysmal update policy even on Google's Pixel phones. But why am I going to pull a shipping sticker to return the cellphone from Amazon? Permanently comes a jerky, loud Schmatzgeräusch. This is only noticeable on my side, regardless of VoLTE and occurs only on phone calls and not on Whatsapp or Facetime. My interlocutor does not hear anything. The basic function of the phone does not work, that's just not to understand for me in such an expensive device. Repeated full reset without backup did not solve the problem. Other sim no solution. If one searches "" Iphone X / XR / XS Crack "" one finds also some threads both in Germany as well as with linking in the USA where the problem is described and also Youtube videos exist. So it is not an isolated case and repeated exchanges are described there as unhelpful. The Apple support itself knows except "" ... give it in the repair "" no advice. Furthermore, a significant stuttering or judder is noted when Apps are re-opened and you scroll in a newly opened menu item. This affects Whatsapp, DB App, Instagram, settings, images ... speak it is not specific to the app but overall. Here, too, search for iphone stutter and you will find plenty. Update: Exchange device knows at least so far no pop / smack or jerks when telephoning. Will show if this remains so. A relatively loud background noise remains. The Iphone6 ​​or Samsung S8 is completely quiet in comparison, both when not said and when spoken. Luck or stutter when scrolling through newly opened pages (contact list, Whatsappchat, Instagram, settings list ...) still available. Supposedly IOS13 should run better in the beta but honestly, I would not like to test it out now and should be half a year after release sowas already solved.Update 2: Ploppgeräusche are synonymous with the replacement device with Vodafone, Otelo and Telekomsimkarte. I'm sorry but there I grab my head and evaluate another star.

6633	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	sirquickly	3	Great smartphone but too expensive for the price	2019-07-12	de	Much has been written about the XR - why add more mustard ...? For many years I was fixated on Apple; then the change to Android. And now? Still private Android and get as a company phone an XR. So much for the Ausgangslage.Entgegen some reviews, I think the display is good, could not fault it. Haptic, as usual from Apple more than very good. Camera good, but not more. Selfie camera phenomenal for the Face ID. It must be almost dark, that I have to type in the code. No jerks and the battery life is great. Everything runs great, no hangs in the apps, etc. Now comes, legitimately, the question: "" why forgive the deer only three stars in this song of praise? The XR is simply too expensive. Private I use a Redmi Note 7th The only point where the iPhone is the Chinese superior to the computer, is the processor performance. In direct comparison, the iPhone in the page layout ( same browser) significantly faster.And the rest? Yes, the Redmi has no inductive charging, no NFC ... .But the camera (with GoogleApp) is equivalent, haptics also, Gorilla Glass, Display .... At a cheaper by almost 600EUR price (respectively the 128gb version). If the XR somewhere at 500-600 EUR I would give 4.5 stars - so the selling price of the XR is simply too high.

It was the first time I set up an iPhone through the cloud.
6642	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Kai	5	best device on the market, a small drawback	2018-12-20	de	I have been using it since May 2018 and I am still very satisfied. During this time, I was also able to test a Galaxy s9 + and a Huawei Mate 20 pro, so I had the direct comparison to the Android cars. The iPhone X is still running very smoothly and the operating system is a dream, especially unlike Huawei. So far I have no scratches, etc. and always used the original Apple leather case. What I like best is the form factor, relatively small device with a large display. I have decided to continue to use the iPhone X because the overall package is unbeatable. Face recognition still works perfectly. Now for the small drawback: The camera could make better photos in this price range, especially in bad light. Since has the Huawei Mate 20 pro clearly ahead, but only there.

After use, I have found that the Mute button on the side of the device has more play, until, for example. from silent to loud, as with the iPhones of my colleagues. Say it wobbles easily if you run a finger over it. After a conversation with an Apple employee, it turned out that this button should normally be rock solid and should not have a game. He also said that as long as it does not restrict functionality, that's not bad, yet a minimal assembly error. It may sound fussy, but with the price I expect 100% quality on a new device.

6647	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	MR Seeck	5	A brilliant telephone ... Attention note	2019-02-02	de	As always with Amazon lightning delivery. The device was sold and delivered directly by Amazon. More on this below. It was as expected in an original VP, which was without damage and sealed. The phone itself was also fully equipped with all papers. There were absolutely NO traces on the phone, which is to be expected from Apple. I had to choose between the Xr and the X. After examining both, it became the X. Why? The screen with the much higher resolution and the OLED itself were the main reasons, plus the smaller form factor and the more elegant frame. The X is like the Xs only slightly underpowered, which any normal Benzutzer but will never notice. Thus one gets an Xs for the price of the X. Good Deal. There is no need to talk about the further advantages of the X. Attention: There are some windy companies in the market who sell remanufactured, or already returned or so-called showcase models, which often have an apparently new packaging "" Originally Welded "". Please note that these are not new devices in the true sense, but apparently new ones, which usually always have to be declared as such. The companies that label their goods as treated or refurbished are reputable and do not leave behind the impression, like the black sheep, that Amazon or Apple may be selling equipment that itself has small defects. Amazon always sells original goods that come directly from the manufacturer. Therefore, the note to future buyers of Apple. If you buy through Amazon, you only opt for devices that are sold and shipped by Amazon to make sure you receive 100% goods. Do not be tempted by supposedly great prizes. The trouble when the money is gone and the device has quirks, not worth it, just to save a few euros. And finally, a note to the Hater comments. My God, folks, are you really so frustrated that you can not scrape together the coal for a really good product, and go to the level of washerwomen?
6648	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Deborah A. Landry	4	Smart design, nice packaging	2018-10-25	de	Opening up the little box was not quite as exciting as the experience of unpacking a new iPhone, but very enjoyable. The design with the magnets and the clip is smart; the instructions very helpful. I like the little black rubber in-ear-securing speaker covers with anatomic hook. Unfortunately, one fell off because it was loose on the ear pod. Would buy this product again over other similar ones! Hope I can get a replacement for the rubber-hook cover.
6649	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	SD	1	Defective, repair, again defective ... Apple's QA is unacceptable	2019-04-28	de	For the second time within the first 2 months, the display is defective. First, the earpiece was broken within the first 2 weeks, after which a new display was installed in the Apple Store.Ca. 1.5 months later, the display is completely green. Nothing is happening anymore. Since the 30 grace days of Amazon are over, I have to now again spend my time in the Apple Store. Quality assurance at Apple seems - compared to the price range - completely unacceptable.
6650	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Sarah F.	5	The best smartphone	2019-06-06	de	For me, my smartphone is the most important everyday companion, which is why I think it's okay to spend just over 900 €. The iPhone X is perfect for performance and comfort. I like the camera in portrait mode, which mimics an SLR camera. Of the photos are many really excited. Sure, there are cheaper phones and not for everyone it makes sense to spend so much money for it. But who wants to have an iPhone, is very well served with this. Before, I had an iPhone 6. For the iPhone XS, I see no significant difference, which is why I have decided for the X. The device I have now for 8 months and it still gives me a great feeling. Incidentally, face recognition also works very well in the dark. : D

6653	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Clemens M.	4	3.5 stars due to some bugs.	2019-06-14	de	I ordered the iPhone X here on Amazon last November, because unfortunately my iPhone 7 Plus gave up the spirit a bit surprisingly after 2 years. First of all, the positive features: 1. The face recognition: I appreciated this feature only when I first had it on my phone. It just makes life a little easier if you can just unlock the phone with "" "", especially with the newly launched in Austria "" Apple Pay2 "" is an excellent thing which I do not want to miss , The OLED display: The display is probably the biggest strength of the X compared to my predecessor. The colors are stronger, especially watching videos on Youtube or something really much more fun. Also the Notch did not strike me as negative, the new gesture control (because without Homebutton) I had internalized within a few days. The camera: Granted, the dual-lense of my 7 Plus was already great, but the camera from the iPhone X makes another jump here. I'm by no means a professional photographer, I'm only taking pictures or photos for my Instagram with it and I have to say - as easy as with the camera of the X I never liked to take good pictures. Also my so filmed concert videos look great, I will attach here from reference which. Now to the negative aspects: 1. Battery: The battery is noticeably weaker than my 7 Plus. I really have to recharge every night, admittedly I listen to a lot of music and am occasionally on various social media sites on the go, but I have at least half a day longer with my 7 Plus - presumably shows the OLED display here negative pages.2. Reception: I often had reception problems or Wi-Fi problems. The Wi-Fi and my provider are still the same as in my 7 Plus where these problems never occurred, I also use the original Apple leather case for the X. Is only a small flaw, but sometimes I noticed and I wanted that too have mentioned.3. Bugs: Unfortunately, since I have the device I have an apparent software bug that sometimes at Whatsapp or iMessage the touchscreen does not respond to an input of a particular letter (always another one). I have been here several times in various Apple stores and MacShark, the device has no defect, the touch screen works 100%. Unfortunately, an exchange of the device is only possible if I send it in and thus I have to spend up to 3 weeks without a smartphone - here I would like something like the earlier express exchange service from Apple, which is no longer offered on demand of my part.FAZIT: If not the annoying Softwarebug and I would not hang so often s.der charging socket I would immediately give 5 stars, the device works lightning fast, no matter how many tabs are open, the new camera is amazing and have the new features such as face recognition, OLED, etc All in all, I am very satisfied, but I would still like to have a device in this price range then just yet I have a low-battery downgrade compared to a 2-year-old device and the otherwise ingeniously simple software works more reliable ,
6654	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Jannik	5	Expectations more than fulfilled	2019-03-31	de	I was Samsung user for years, my last Apple device was many years back (iPod touch 2nd generation). So I was with the operation and handling of the iPhone in Neuland.Der shipping was great, everyone is only recommended no preference which smartphones ONLY FROM AMAZON TO BUY (sold and sent by Amazon) to exclude any fraud or the like. To transfer my data from the Samsung Galaxy S8 to the iPhone X I wanted to use the app 'move to iOS', unfortunately, my wireless connection broke but always only EXACTLY THEN off, when I entered the code to transfer the data. Thus, all contacts etc. had to be entered manually, which was at first relatively frustrating, but in retrospect only a small problem. All in all, the change to iOS was one Lightness, the operating system is very user friendly, new and old functions can be explained in the 'Tips' section. The history recognition runs flawlessly, remains flawless even in the dark. The camera shoots 1A photos, resolution and display are top.Other small features such as Facetime or the general better customization of apps on iOS embellish the experience. Finally, the iPhone X shines with a sophisticated design, however, a shell is recommended because with Glass jacketed smartphone otherwise quickly loses the visual touch.
6655	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Amaz-Kunde	5	Great camera, long battery life, very powerful, best display	2019-04-03	de	Purchased directly from Amazon. Packaging was unopened, the iPhone accordingly brand new. It is a very good device. Makes excellent pictures. The battery lasts about 1.5 days with an average of 4.5 hours screen on time. Will probably still receive several years of updates and in performance it also brings with it more than enough resources. As long as it does not fall down, it should not be a problem for the next 3-4 years.

The face recognition works fast and error-free, the Oled screen is razor sharp and the memory is big enough. But the battery is a joke! After only 4 months, the battery state has dropped to 94%! Charging with conventional charging cable takes forever! But inductive charging is a cool feature if you have the time! All in all a great phone!

I have despite some bad reviews ordered a new X. What should I say, delivery time as specified and unpacked. New SIM card inserted, within minutes of the cloud everything up to "" short-before-loss "" condition updated and until the financial penalty for own stupidity has been like everything since before! I hope not, but if so, then again. , ,

6738	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Markus	3	The Iphone X persuaded me to switch to Android after 15 years of using Iphones	2019-01-30	de	Note: the 3 star rating refers to the original retail price of EUR 1,149.00 and my experience now with Android respectively the Huawei mate 20 Pro! As you can see above, I've been talking to iPhones for over 15 years, and that's what it always was very satisfied. Like many iPhone users, I thought that Apple is on the verge that Android can not hold its own. Since I switched from the iPhone X to the Huawei mate 20 pro 2 weeks ago, I was instructed better.Before I start right now about Apple, I have to say positively that the iPhone X here now for EUR 876, - is offered and therefore now has a really good price-performance ratio. But that was, as we all certainly do not always remember, costing the iPhone X for sale fabulous EUR 1,149 !!! And this outrageous price, along with the company policy of Apple has moved me to Apple after more than 15 years But what had happened? In autumn 2018, the iPhone 8 came out at EUR 799, -. It was just as exciting as the last predecessor by design. At the same time, the iPhone X appeared with a good camera as usual, a very good display and the new full display design with Notch. The iPhone X had with it a design, as it should have a flagship smartphone in the fourth quarter of 2018, and how today every Chinaböller from 150, - EUR has. The impudence for me was that you bring out the 8 Series with old design at 799, -, and then in parallel a contemporary model to 1.149, - !!! Yes, which one would you like to buy ??? And it is also cheeky that Apple has pretended that they had invented something groundbreaking and brought it to market. But that's not true Samsung had already delivered a great design 2 years ago with the Galaxy 8 Edge, which was perfected with the 9 Edge. And also at the end of 2018, almost all well-known smartphone manufacturers had a full-display design. And let's face it honestly the Notch was certainly not a groundbreaking invention, even if the design does not bother me. This also proves that now the first Neuaufstellugnen or announcements for 2019 no longer have a Notch, but a camera hole. For me as a longtime customer was the introduction of the X at the same time with the 8 to the outrageously inflated price just a scam. At first I refused to buy the Xer. When my 6s but then gave up the ghost, and I received the Xer with a contract extension for a good price (EUR 680, -), I then bought it. Yes and of course I was satisfied with that. Anyone who knows Apple knows that the workmanship, the feel of the technology and of course the very good operating system just fit. Of course, I was also happy with the camera, and I have to say that in my opinion the iPhone X of all current flagships is best handled by the design (not a 16: 9 format). But it just did not grab me anymore, and after the display jumped and I was faced with the choice of spending $ 400 to repair it, or buying a new phone, I opted for a new hanyan. And my choice many on the Huawei mate 20 per. Of course, this part with EUR 1.000,00 also piggy-back, but I think it is more valuable than the iPhone X. I personally like the design better with the sloping edges.The display is just awesome, performance anyway and the camera with all its features is also great. Even if I do not want to evaluate, since the iPhone X has also a top camera and when filming is about better. Of course I was a bit skeptical before the change, if I would not regret the system change, since I about 8 years ago ever switched to a Galaxy and then could not do anything with Android and the part after 1 week again exchanged for an Apple heb. But things have apparently changed over the years. And after 2 weeks of use I have to say, what have I missed everything at Apple. Android in combination with the Huawei EMUI surface makes the iPhone X look really old. Apple just has not brought out any real innovations in the last few years. The last one was I think 3d touch, which does not use a pig (yes and of course Face ID, which I do not need necessarily, and what everyone has today). Now when I use the mate 20, I feel like I'm holding a flagship mobile phone from 2019, while IOS is a dinosaur. I can not go into detail here, that would be beyond the scope. But the mate 20 is so much more innovative in everyday life. That starts with the banality that I can set the alarm tone (which is way more pleasant than the iPhone) in the system quieter. On the iPhone I had to go before going to sleep always the louder-quiet rocker to make the ringtone quieter. Woe if you forget that before sleeping. then you are very rudely roused from sleep (one of many examples that at Apple for a long time no programmer thinks more) But give on Youtube times tips and tricks Huawei mate 20 pro. There shows a guy for 25 minutes, a tip after the other, there's you as an Apple user socks off! If I were to make such a video on the iPhone X, that would probably be done in 3 to 5 minutes. There are not really many tricks or innovative features to show here! Conclusion: I know that this is not a correct review. Maybe I just wanted to vent my anger about Apple's corporate policy. The iPhone X is certainly a top smartphone and IOS a great operating system, although not as innovative as it once was. And at the currently offered price of just under EUR 880, - you can buy the iPhone X without hesitation (if you can do without a more modern and innovative operating system as currently on Android and EMUI). I can also imagine that I get a lot of negative feedback from Apple users here, but I can only say that over 15 years Apple use it, that I think the product is good, but it just lost its unique selling point and also the Starting price of EUR 1,149, - absolutely was not justified. And I just give all long-time Apple users the tip to think outside the box (I did it too). Try a current Android device. The best Huawei, as this with the in-house EMUI surface is very similar to the iPhone. It was not hard for me to change and I changed my habit on the first day and did not regret the decision to change. On the contrary, I'm glad that I finally got rid of the Apple universe with all its limitations on data transfer. Eventually, I will eventually switch to the iPhone again. But Apple really has to come up with something, develop new innovations and also work on the price and company policy !!!
6739	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	U. Marten	5	In use from December 2017 to today (October 2018)	2018-10-13	de	After almost a year, I can say a lot about the revolutionary iPhone X. First, the negative: 1. Price: Without Zeifel the device was initially very expensive. Nevertheless, I have decided to do so, because I use my phone much more frequently than, for example, a laptop. The latter was much cheaper to buy for it.2. Fear of breakage and high costs: As recommended, I have wrapped my iPhone and provided with a glass sheet. Minor falls tolerated the device already. A short fright was nevertheless there regularly. However, I still assume that if the device falls from a certain height, the repair costs could be well over half of the purchase price. That would be a disaster! So far, everything is fine! 3. Waterproof: This property I challenged in the last vacation. For videos and photos below the water surface in the pool. Partly deeper than 1 m. Everything went fine the first time. Last time I was under water for a bit longer and maybe even deeper. After this fun, the speaker did not work properly anymore. Only with the download of an app that generates a sound in a certain frequency, the speaker recovered. The device works again without problems. Here, too, the shock was deep. Portrait pictures: Depending on the incidence of light, the portrait function may partly lead to deformations of the persons depicted in the photos. Basically, the photos are very nice, but the portraits work only with the right lighting conditions. Now the positives: 1. Bindschirm The picture quality is very good. I also quickly got used to the format. The recess for the camera and face recognition is no obstacle for me! The design: Perfectly processed and optically a trendsetter. You could see competitors stepping on this bandwagon. You can tell, Apple has always been a small step ahead.3. Camera: Photos, even under difficult conditions, succeed perfectly! The possibilities are also really practical and contemporary. Actually, almost like a photographer, you can quickly take great pictures of yourself. Even under difficult conditions, it works great! The possibilities are also really practical and contemporary. Videos are also good. Also the sound recording. For me, an additional camera with this device has become completely unnecessary.4. PerformanceThe performance is enormous. You can use AirPlay to transfer eg GoogleEarth on the TV and to rotate and zoom the world smoothly.5. FaceID works very well in most cases. Even with dirty hands eg when cooking is in my opinion the better technique compared to the fingerprint. Operation / comfortAlso here the user has the regular feeling that a premium smartphone to use. For small hands, the size of the screen might be a bit more cumbersome.Other / Conclusion: As neutral, I would consider the battery life. You come through the day. All in all, I can say that the device is very expensive and there are certain risks, such as the break down, but the comfort and technical possibilities are very good and jumpy progressive. The quality is very high quality, photos and videos succeed well and you can see a lot on the big screen what you want to see - the edge is almost gone. Who uses the smartphone extensively and the features are important, has everything you need - if also for a proud price. Purchase recommendation: Yes!

Unfortunately, I then discovered a very visible scratch on the iPhone display. The hope that this is hopefully only on the protective film disappeared after removing it. I'll send the phone back. What's this for? Why are there quality controls if they do not find obvious defects or mistakes on such an expensive product?

6748	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Niczilla	3	Too expensive	2019-01-26	de	I'm actually an iPhone fanatic. I have been able to try many brands & models so far. The first thing that struck me as negative about the iPhone X: there is no longer the small needle with which you can open the SIM compartment. Yes, says the colleague, I'll do it with the paperclip. Because of: it requires a paper clip with tact, you do not want to scrap such an expensive part, because you fool around it. Well, Apple saves, despite the high price of a cent article. Not good. It is striking: the headphones are in a cardboard part, not as usual in a fixed box. Saved again! I have set up two devices again. One wanted an update before you could set it up, setup only went with Apple ID login, which was not possible because the update was needed. I guess 9 out of 10 buyers in the situation would be desperate. I'm really not used to this from Apple. High price = luxury.What can the X do more than the 6s? It's damn fast.No finger press, Zack, unlocked: iPhone has recognized you.Otherwise ... if you're not a techie: sorry, then it still does 6s , Everything else is cool, my iPhone is cooler than yours. Nevertheless, the iPhones are simply great. Two points deduction for price in combination with the mentioned savings and the complicated initial setup.

6750	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Sascha Drochen	5	Very good, original devices	2018-09-17	de	Everything went very fast. Very good device. However, Apple has now removed the iPhone X from its store because the XR, XS and XS Max are coming. The prices for an X should therefore loose below 700, - fall from the 21.09 when the new models come, everything else does not pay off, since a XR 849, - costs and is equipped with the latest features. Everything else the display, this is LCD, what you do not mind. So dear providers, goes with the times, down with the price
6751	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Mingo2000	5	iPhone X	2018-09-08	de	Got today my IPhone X and could test it extensively .... Granted I was a bit skeptical because of the missing Home Button! But long story short. It is the best IPhone that I ever had! Just great, good IOS was I already known, but now the screen over the entire screen and the handling just great .... Thanks to Apple even if the price is grossly overdrawn, but the loss of value is not as big as Android and by a contract extension will be synonymous payable.
6752	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	TeaLow	1	No more Apple innovation and way too expensive!	2018-10-03	de	I have now switched back to Android with a larger display. The only two positive things I liked about the iPhone X were the look and feel and the ability to sync with my other Apple devices like Mac and iPad. Otherwise, the device is just snot. Battery life is not intoxicating, I do not like the operation synonymous, the camera is not better than other, much cheaper devices. In some situations, it is even worse. I find it absolutely ridiculous, why Apple does not finally extend the camera mode times ... professional mode, new filters, etc. All wrong. At IOS, I miss so many opportunities and simplifications that I have with Android, such as Always on display, splitsreen, mirror-share or mirror-screen, fast closing of all apps, etc. For Android, my device connects to e.g. directly after switching on e.g. with my Bluetooth speaker, the iPhone can not do that and I always have to connect the device manually. What bothers me so animal is that always Bluetooth automatically turns on ... what is this shit? I would like to determine if and when I turn on Bluetooth. Did I already mention the missing fast-loading part ?! Since Steve Jobs is no longer with us, it's not really progressing any more and the new iPhones confirm that absolutely. Since one wants to let now the last loyal Apple customers bleed properly, with up to 1600 € for the new devices. Absolutely ill. I do not need to write about the endless problems with IOS and Apple hardware, you can read about it almost every week on the net. So I can only advise anyone from Apple, who would like to do something more than phone calls ... oh yes, there was not something with the reception problem ;-) And if there is now the argument ... at Apple, you get yes for years updates ... may be, but with the blatant weaknesses, I prefer to buy every 2-3 years a new Android Phone for half or a third of the price and then always have the latest software and the latest technology.
6753	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Marsupilami	2	Totally behind the competition. Viewpoints that drive you crazy - I give up!	2018-11-28	de	Autumn 2018. After my iPhone 6s, I had painfully switched to a Galaxy S8 (got the S8 for free). Terrible conversion from iOS to Android. And yes, even after about 5 weeks now I'm still cursing now and then on Android. A step back to the 6s was no longer possible; I was used to the big OLED display of the S8. However, after I really go off some iPhone features, I recently got myself an iPhone X 256m. Comparable surface S8 and X. Both from 2018 BJ. Both OLED from the house Samsung.- S8 has the sharper display. You can see it. Despite all the "" from xy ppi one sees no difference .. "" BUT! Looks man.- S8 has the harsher colors (I do not like myself, here is the iPhone better) - S8 has the sharper camera with the harsher colors (not realistic, but sharper and brighter) .- S8 with Android is customizable, iOS Static is always static. For this, iOS always and everywhere runs with all compatible devices (eg in the car, on the hi-fi system, etc.) - ... etc. In principle, there are nuances and thus differences to be forgiven. The reason why I still hand over the iPhone X.- Prices / Performance is subterraneous compared to the S8- The viewing angles are quite stable in S8, the iPhone X discolored with minimal movement, the display so strong that it annoys me animal (pictures, etc. are simply distorted by the "" handling "". Here, the "" Farbadjustment "" does not help, it is the Blickwinkel.Und before anyone asks ... I have sent it and (today) get the "" repaired "" Phone with a new display (Therefore, today the unnerved review. Finally, have my proof before and after the repair.) Minimal improvement, a few tiny degrees more are now in. It is not enough Here, the S8 is so much better, and only costs 1/3 of the iPhone X. both phones side by side and moves the devices synchronously, you can see quite quickly the difference. What brings me the "" better "" Color / Brightness / ... Appearance of the iPhone X when the colors / presentation in the "handling" of the phone so deteriorate that it annoys you?! Apple, maybe the end of 2019 or the end of 2020 again. If any.

6755	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	O. Guenther	5	Everything fits here ...	2019-01-04	de	After many years of use of Windows phones, it was initially reluctantly back to Android, after the Windows devices have unfortunately done in the market. A good phone of the main competitor of Apple made initially a lot of joy. After about a year, however, there were more problems with the top model of the previous year and the phone hung on a regular basis. Before the usual rapid decline in the price of Android devices, this was also in the price range of an iPhone. I've been using the iPhone X for several months now and it's going fantastic like the first day. In addition comes the long-term update care of Apple, which in principle promises a much longer full use compared to Android. I've struggled a bit longer to buy an iPhone because of the price. But I think not least of the previous use, that the certain extra charge for corresponding top smartphones from Android pays off (at least if you do not need the latest model for each model change). A smartphone with great feel and features. All in all, definitely five stars.
6756	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Yassin	2	I would not recommend anyone !!!	2019-02-11	de	I have had many devices from Samsung to Apple to Huawei, the device is one of the biggest flops I ever had! Of course there are also positive sides such as eg. the camera or the really noble design but after I had the device in my hand I just thought my god how could I spend so much money on such a cell phone which honestly could not really convince me .. Let's get started the design itself is all very well, but of course the price is too exaggerated, because you only pay the logo .. the device I had some days of course in use it runs in the end quite fluently and has no jerks or such, apps open and close incredibly fast and the power quality is great, too, but you would have the price of about 150 to 200 ¬ set so that the device corresponds to its price, there are other Android devices that definitely for 450 to 500 ¬ as much and usually even have a better display .. An iPhone I would never buy back then the devices were still okay for the price but today is there s all GeldmagereiFor absolute Apple fans, the device is of course a highlight! And I say so the device ansich I liked quite okay but the price is what I am a thorn in the eye .. If my recession in the purchase decision helped him further, I would be happy about a helpful vote

6758	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	mixdevil	3	no longer perfect	2018-10-25	de	First I would like to say what bothers me and what I've experienced so far (iPhone owners are iPhone 2). The iPhone crashes regularly at regular intervals, often you do not notice it because it looks normal again after booting, you just have to enter the pin because the face ID does not work then. Most often, the error occurs in long-term use, eg via bluetooth in the car listening to music over the car radio. It happens that it crashes every 20 minutes. What then helps is a shutdown and start again, then I'm lucky that it runs over an hour. I have normal day use that happens to me only 2-3 times a day. As I have learned in forums, this is not uncommon. This has never happened to me before. Otherwise, I find the quantum leap from iPhone 8 to iPhone X just succeeded and long overdue, the operation is intuitive and face Id works mostly very well. The price, on the other hand, is an absolute impudence, how many billions will apple still want to gain. 1000 euro for the 256 Gb device would have been absolutely sufficient, especially since the memory costs nothing more. For this reason, I will again downgrade the next model and take the cheaper even if I then have to do without OLED and the second camera

6760	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Anders	4	Super Smartphone!	2019-02-22	de	First of all I did not buy my iPhone X over Amazon and can say nothing about delivery and origin. To the iPhone itself: Was always an Apple fan and one says Apple always Apple. That's why I will not see everything positive here. Because only the price is certainly far too high for this Handy.Aber you pay not only for the logo or design. You also pay for the perfect for me! No jerks no hangers or other it runs smoothly! This can be said by android maybe 2-3 months but then the first problems come. And no not a cheap Android smartphone. In addition, you get a long time for a new update for IOS! The battery is amazing ... I'm unfortunately a total cellphone junkie ... and hung sogut as always every day from morning to evening before certainly with minimal interruptions but already very dependent , And I'm fine with the day! If I'm on the go, the battery will last for 1 1/2 days! For Apple top that I never thought.You must certainly be a fan of a Notch and that's me! Inside of the phone, the camera is really great, I like to take pictures. There are beautiful pictures in out just in the Potraitmodus.Außerlich the iPhone, of course, looks super classy and is super processed! However, I think that the louder and quieter keys are very slightly sharp-edged. But that does not bother or hurt. And with sheath schonmal garnicht.I'm absolutely satisfied but as I said I love Apple! Had an android transition before ... It was not bad but I quickly missed Apple. I would buy it again and again. I love the phone!

6762	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Dirk G.	3	With one hand, unfortunately, no longer in the upright format to use	2018-11-01	de	The iPhone 10 is unfortunately bad in one hand and the control panels are no longer reachable with the thumb. The now "virtual" homebutton is located at the bottom of the iPhone. In order to achieve this, the iPhone has to be gripped at the bottom, which then, due to the extended design, unfortunately leads to the one tilting the iPhone backwards out of his hand. The control center is now stored at the top right of the display, so far away from the homebutton. Both functions can only be reached via constant embrace. This is complicated and annoying. If the iPhone is turned from high to across, the screen rotates as usual. Unfortunately, it is now the case that due to the camera list in the upper part of the display, it looks like the display is defective in this area. Not nice either. With shocked I have now heard that the new iPhone 10 r is even longer, so the upright operation with one hand even less is possible. Face ID is stupid in the car: Previously could simply be pressed the homebutton to unlock the iPhone now must While driving, the iPhone will be properly aligned for faceid to work. This is actually impossible if the phone is in a rigid mobile phone car holder ... Otherwise, it should be mentioned here, the display, the camera, the photo software and the performance is breathtakingly good.
6763	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	h.sotha	5	Once iPhone always iPhone	2018-08-12	de	I'm not about to apply iPhone as a showpiece dick. I want a smartphone that (1.) both hardware and software is stable (2.) fast (3.) looks good (4.) makes good photos, videos, etc. It may be that Apple products in the price-performance ratio by far more expensive than the competition. But if one considers that the resale value is also correspondingly high, the argument "too expensive" is unnecessary in my view. Compared to predecessor models (up to i7) are in each of the above. Points partly significant increases to recognize. In addition, the super oled display and the very successful face recognition. Therefore from me clear purchase recommendation. The only thing you have to get used to is that before you know what key combination for "off" is provided, first make some unwanted screenshots and the not to be missed, missing home button.
6764	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Lasek	4	In fact a great device, but ...	2019-03-17	de	Have the iPhone X now 2 months. The feel and the look are great, of course. The camera is second to none ........ But honestly ..... I miss Touch ID. Face ID works fine, but I personally liked Touch ID. With Face ID the Lockscreen still has to be searched up to land on the homescreen. One should not be too far away from the camera so that it is unlocked at all. These 2 points meanwhile go to the biscuit and lead to a point deduction in the review. Everything else works perfectly.

Buy recommendation if the price is reduced to a healthy level ... eg by half
6769	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Amazon Kunde	5	Between IPhone X and 8 Plus only the prices compete	2018-07-25	de	The iPhone X is the new star in the iPhone universe: For the first time since the iPhone 6, there is a new design. The new high-contrast XXL screen covers almost the entire front and is THE highlight of the X. The innovative face recognition works well and faster after some habituation than the iris scan of the competition. The processor is as turbo-fast as the iPhone 8, the tele zoom of the second camera lens hardly noticeably improved. The biggest disappointment: The battery does not even make ten hours of intensive use, as is especially the 8 Plus more enduring.

The form factor is perfect on a larger display, in my opinion. It is great in the hand. However, a shell is a must because it is very smooth and can slip easily out of hand. The operation of the iOS without the home button is slightly different, but quickly internalized. The price is without a doubt steep and everyone should decide for themselves. If & shipping through the dealer was perfect.

6783	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	XXX	5	upper class	2018-08-06	de	The conclusion in advance: For me, the best overall package, which exists on the market. Professional camera with great results looking the same. Great sound experience with music & phone calls. Sufficient battery capacity for two days. Design-technically appealing and a stable construction complete the package. The only downside is the Preis.Bericht: Since the iPhone 4, I've had pretty much every iPhone. Later came a MacBook, an iPad and now an Apple Watch and HomePod. Compatibility and functionality are second to none. The integrity of the software as well. I have always changed. The longest I had the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 / G7.Android could not convince me on several levels. Why IOS and iPhone: 1. CompatibilityI synced all photos on the Mac and with my devices. Easy to handle and, above all, safe. The iPhone X in portrait mode lets the layman think a professional camera would have been at work. Simply great. The X replaces my digital camera to 100% and the results can be seen. Also video recordings are absolutely great. What is particularly convincing is lifelike recording. It just looks like real. Not oversaturated, no brighter colors usw..Auch after years, I even like the pictures of the iPhone 5.2. From the sound could only keep up with the G7, where the differences but in some songs within some songs seemed too artificial. With Apple music, the overall package works much better. The player is also simple but functional. Playlists are quickly created and accessible from any of my devices. As an advocate of discrete data, I was not initially a friend of Cloud and the like. However, those who are concerned with the topic know that IOS is safer than Android and even tampering with the authorities. For the money, I trust Apple.3. Device clean, stable and best handling despite display size. Thanks to Apple that there are still handy devices. I do not know why the delusion of size and at the same time a tablet to do so. In sports, with children, at work or on the road, the input operation is fundamental. Not only for the quick snapshot, but also for telephone or music control is so much better. The quality is excellent. No button wobbles. After almost a year, only the Alurahmwn is scratched. However, a protective cover was rarely worn.4. ConnectionsMakes everything clean and without problems. I am often surprised how the system keeps all the components apart and still works cleanly. Conclusion: Recommended to anyone who attaches great importance to photos, music and telephony.
6784	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	House-Freak1988	5	Super Smartphone	2018-02-07	de	I switched from the SE to the X. Display is really great, very bright and top of the colors. I have turned off True Tone, because the colors are otherwise too reddish. For me personally important point is the camera: In low light conditions are worlds between the two cameras. In bright daylight, the SE has already delivered good pictures, here is the improvement not soooo clearly visible. Super is also the 10x zoom. The changeover (no homebutton, Face ID) is not really an act. I got used to it very quickly. I am (so far) very satisfied with the smartphone. The only criticism is the high price.
6785	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Kurti	5	the best smartphone "" where there are	2018-05-02	de	I'm probably not the default user. For me, the iPhone is 100% a working tool. Professionally, I have put together a workable system for the job. Macbook Air, Mac Mini, Airport Extreme and the 3 GB Time Capsule. The smartphone is just a part of it. I started with the iPhone 3, then iPhone 4s, iPhone 5s and finally 6s. I did not hold on to the latter until the end. So far, I thought it was not better. But I'll tell you - it goes. Some advantages of the iPhone X briefly noted: - Camera - super, just the new portrait mode I use for taking pictures of technical details, - nice big screen, - Face ID - class and even works diagonally on the Dashboard in the vehicle, - speed in the apps - noticeably faster, and, and, and .... The back is unfortunately very slippery through the glass. Since I always use a transparent silicone case for the iPhone's, this small problem is also solved. So does not bother the sublime design of the camera on the back absolutely nicht.Die so-called "" notch "" is actually gone from day two. The fanfare in the media around this thing can be forgotten. It is really only someone who looks up for the first time. A bit I miss but the percentage of state of charge rechts.Also above all, to be recommended.

The large display, the speed and the operation are simply first class! In addition, the low weight, the OLED display and the camera are amazing! Would buy it again at any time and can only recommend it to anyone who wavers between the plus and the X. The price difference is a bit steep, but it's worth it!

6789	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Kerstin	5	I'm excited	2018-02-21	de	The shipping and selling of A-Montain was smooth. In the beginning, I was a bit skeptical as to whether this phone is for me (especially at the price) but I have to say it's worth the money. I love the camera, the battery life (compared to my old Iphone 6s) and the design. The display is superior in comparison to the Iphone 6s, also the processor speed. FaceID works a lot better, even in the dark, as I imagined , Of course, one can now argue about whether it really is worth so much money. However, my experience shows that I have the Apple devices just longer in my possession, because they are not immature after a year and still work well.So I am completely satisfied and do not regret the purchase!
6790	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Tarran David	5	Really fast	2018-02-20	de	As fast as ever. I came from the latest Samsung. I love how fast it is and how good the camera is. Use it a lot, battery could still be better.
6791	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Tobias	5	Super Smartphone	2018-02-20	de	I bought the iPhone only very hesitant, because I was afraid that it is not processed high quality, because it was just under 150 ¬ cheaper than Apple directly. Finally, I decided to do it and do not regret it to this day. So far no problems with the iPhone had. I can only recommend it to buy.
6792	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Max M	5	Jubilee Iphone	2018-01-28	de	First of all: I did not buy the iPhone X via Amazon but rather via an electronic market that was not mentioned by name. I had previously an iPhone SE and I was always very satisfied with it. The IPhone X, I have now been in use for a good two weeks and would like to dwell on some points.-) Design-) Display-) Face ID-) Camera) Battery -) Voice quality (that's first and foremost a telephone) Design: The look of the iPhone Ten is great. It is great in the hand and just feels extremely valuable. Everything is rock solid and nothing wobbles or creaks. The size is just so suitable for your one-handed operation. (Although I have big hands) But from time to time you have to embrace. I had the iPhone SE before and thought that was the perfect smartphone size. When I look at the old part now, it seems almost tiny. ;) About the purchase of a case you should think, because the phone is very slippery by the two glass sides and tends to glass breakage in a fall.Display: The display is great and very sharp. The OLED panel comes from Samsung, but was calibrated by Apple. Colors are not too gaudy, white and black are in a nutshell. The "True Tone" (the colors are shown warmer) feature is very useful and protects the eyes. If you tilt the iPhone to the side, the display quickly gets a blue cast, which I do not feel annoying. The much scolded notch at the top of the display, the "notch" I do not feel annoying. Face ID Touch ID never used, so I can not say much. The new technique: Face ID works very reliable in 98% of cases. Sometimes it hooks up and you have to unlock Manuel by code entry. For example, if the phone is on the table or shortly after getting up;) All in all, Face ID but a successful innovation! Camera: The camera I have so far used little, but what I have found so far is brutally good and makes endless have fun. Extremely sharp and detailed images, even in bad light. The portrait mode is still in its infancy (officially beta) and the filters are not always right.Sometimes too much is cut, sometimes a border stops. But yes-beta. The camera shoots 4K video at 60 fps and 1080p video at 240 fps, eliminating the need for a compact camera. You do not have to understand Apple's decision to let the camera lenses feel 2 meters out of the case, which means that the iPhone X on a table could function loosely as a rocker ... With an optional but recommendable case that can be easily remedied.Battery : The battery of the iPhone X is sufficiently dimensioned and you can easily get it over the day. Even 1.5 - 2 days are possible with little use. Nice is that the iPhone X finally supports wireless charging via Qi standard. But I have not tried it yet. Charging, and for me that is the only real criticism of the iPhone X, takes almost 4h !!! (Unfortunately, Apple lays down only a standard 5W power supply, which is a pity at the price! Voice quality: The IPhone X is a great digital camera, a great camcorder, a reliable sat nav, etc. In short, a great companion in everyday life That's why I want to rate the voice quality separately.The voice quality is very good and clear.The background noise is filtered out and suppressed.And my interlocutors have always understood me clearly.Feeling the best voice quality I ever had with a phone Conclusion: The iPhone X is a great device and for me the best Iphone ever - a worthy anniversary Iphone! I would not miss it anymore. I would rate it with 4.7 stars because I find it annoying the Apple itself Almost 4 hours to recharge with the standard power supply, I feel as too long, but since I can not give 4.7 stars and I am 4 stars for such a great device too little, I give 5 stars! Whether you're ready to spend so much money on a smartphone, everyone has to decide for themselves! I regret nothing!!! ;)

6795	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Leicki	5	You got what you pay for	2018-01-27	de	What should I say great about the product, I think it should be self-evident. PERFECT!!! Well-known Apple quality. In mobile phones or laptops or TVs, etc., one decides at some point for a manufacturer. The decision of which manufacturer likes one better or not always lies in the eye of the user. Although Apple pays a lot of money ... for the products, but gets a very good product with a better service I think in the background, which then justifies the price somewhere again. It does not always have to be the latest technology you have, it has to work. And that's what Apple has achieved with this product again. It can be operated like all other iOS devices previously, ie. the "" conversion "" was not present. If the device is configured correctly, then you have a battery life of about 2 - 3 days (at the beginning, of course not, because you have to test everything extensively, for example, Animoji ;-P). From my side, top product, which you have to afford first, but if you can be very satisfied.

For me, the best iPhone I've ever had. (Am years of iPhone users). The graphics are great and I like the new features. The Notch personally bothers me not at all.

6804	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	☀️Sunny²	4	iPhone X - Xtra expensive	2018-06-22	de	Finally I have dared and have changed from the iPhone 8 to the iPhone X. It immediately strikes the 5.8-inch OLED display with the NOTCH, the back is made of glass and it has become a little heavier, so it is a bit grippier The new A11 processor promises a higher performance and the camera has been improved once again. Cable-free charging now works with a corresponding Qi charger, because the Iphone X has different dimensions, you unfortunately need new covers and covers , Here again the news in detail: Face IDThe biometric unlocking function called Face ID does not rely on fingerprints, but on face recognition. It works extremely reliable: The system recognizes me at night, with and without glasses. However, this could be a tick faster. That will be the case with the upcoming IOS 12 update. I do not want to miss Face ID anymore. The camera has improved Apple: A new image signal processor and a LED flash and a bright maximum aperture get the best out of the photos raus.Hier was optimized to the right place. A special highlight is the portrait mode, which makes beautiful photos on the front and main camera. The camera offers: • 12 megapixel main camera / 7 megapixel front camera • portrait mode • slow motion videos • optical image stabilization • body and face recognition • HDR, continuous shooting, panoramic pictures etc. Selfie HD camera has automatic image stabilization. The front camera can now also photos with blur effect in the background record. If necessary, you can also activate various art filters (Portrait Lighting). If you compare the pictures with older iPhones are the pictures a little better Especially the portrait mode that is still in beta, I do not want to miss anymore. Display with True ToneNew is "True Tone" known from the iPad Pro. The display adjusts the display automatically to the color temperature of the ambient light.Stereo speakersWhen playing games or even watching a YouTube video, you can now fully enjoy its costs.From the lower speakers as well as from the outer ear comes a nice stereo sound that I would not want to miss anymore. That the jack plug has disappeared does not really bother me. I have been using Bluetooth headphones for a long time or listening to loudspeakers as I saidThe battery life is 2,716 mAh, the iPhone X has 2 batteries installed, I could not find a very large difference to my iPhone 8, these are minimal. But what has changed is the charging time , this has deteriorated noticeably, since the battery is much larger. New IOS concept No homebutton anymore and I do not miss it.After 2 days you forgot it. The new gestures are new and intuitive. The habituation goes straight into the flesh, it seems somehow more modern and works perfectly. Something I miss the gesture that you can wipe the individual apps, but in IOS 12 makes this feature available again. The Taptic Engine gives feedback to the user in several areas: if you pull the control center from bottom to top, the iPhone vibrates slightly as soon as the window "hits" ". Just like the alarm clock: it rings and shakes the alarm. These are playful little things, but exactly this love to detail I like at Apple and the iPhone X. Bluetooth 5.0 The new low-energy standard doubles the transmission rate compared to Bluetooth 4.2.Bluetooth 5.0 has an approximately 4 times higher range, ideal for all Apple Watch user.Language quality / InternetThe iPhone X leaves a good impression as a mobile phone and surf machine.The voice quality is excellent, especially if you have an HD voice connection and the Internet is available swift as an arrow. Pro great camera with good image quality in low light & portrait mode Waterproof case High speed thanks to Apple A11 processor Stereo speaker Face ID functions day and night nice bright and large OLED display with True Tone good battery life thanks to 2.716 mAh Bluetooth 5.0 wireless charging Contra no Power charger, therefore longer load times Face ID could be a tick faster No memory expansion XTRA - expensive►►►►► CONCLUSION: My personal highlights are the large OLED display, Touch ID, wireless charging and the improved camera with the various new modes.In terms of performance Apple has once again gone a step further: The new A11 Fusion processor does a great job here and the new IOS operating concept for the iPhone X is intuitive. Bluetooth 5.0 is new and just for Apple Watch user a nice thing. Who should now on the iPhone X Update? People who can afford it, because the iPhone X is not cheap. I notice the difference to my iPhone 8, it's just the next generation iPhone. It is a whole new feeling and it has become the iPhone that I have been waiting for 2 years. Unnoticeable to me, however, is the scary delivery. Why a power charger is not there, is incomprehensible.Who attaches a device for such a high price, should make sure that the overall package is really perfect. Hence a star deduction from me.

6809	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Postillleaks.de	5	About a great smartphone and less great prosperity discussions ...	2017-11-05	de	We hold the device since Friday in the hands and give here first impressions again, which may be supplemented later. But first: It is as safe as the amen in the church, that in a new iPhone presentation, the critics come out of their holes , Sometimes the technology is not innovative enough, sometimes it is complained that the new features have been copied and are now installed in other devices. This year is massively working off the price that Apple calls for its new flagship and in advance: yes, 1,319 euros for a smartphone are a damn lot of money. Apart from the fact that even this price is always a subjective benchmark, which can vary depending on the usage behavior of each purchase, the hidden behind it criticism of the affluent society is meant nicely, but often enough rather hypocritical therefore. Why the guilty conscience just supposed to be present on iPhone users, but not on Samsung TV peepholes or Jack Wolfskin jacket straps, nobody could tell us conclusively until today. Fair trade is all that is not and is produced as good as always inexpensive in third countries. But back to the price: Smartphones nowadays function as useful helpers in everyday life. For 1.319 euros, the buyer of the iPhone X gets a phone (surprise!), A camera, which makes now portrait pictures, the SLR level reached (of course, not in the same resolution), a camcorder that records in 60FPS in 4K, a Navigation device, a calendar, a voice recorder ... what we want to say: a smartphone unites in itself meanwhile quite a lot of devices. And that the competition at the same level does not sell for half, has hopefully meanwhile rumgesprochen.Sei it. The discussion Apple vs everyone else will continue. A strange ritual. But even people who get an iPhone as a status symbol (which is silly, since status symbols are more likely to be found in the watch / car / yacht segment) do that out of their very own drive and ultimately it is not up to anyone to judge The incredibly compact design of the iPhone X makes it just a few millimeters larger than an iPhone 8, but due to the rimlessness it has a bigger screen than the Plus model. Thus, the approximately 36 grams lighter (compared to our predecessor phone 6s Plus) cell phone just wonderfully in the hand. Due to the glass surface on the back of a case, however, is highly recommended, especially since the repair should also be extremely expensive. With a case or an enclosing case but also the problem of the protruding camera solved. The display itself, Apple has not promised too much, as one bragged with naked values: it is crisp, has bright colors and the fonts see on the " Super Retina "really like carved. If you scroll over some web pages, a minimal (!) Nachschlieren the font falls on.No idea if you get the software under control, it does not bother. The notch and the rounded corners also do not bother, on the contrary. You look great on apps designed for that, when almost the entire screen is filled. With not yet optimized apps, however, something is missing directly, but most developers pull it quickly (Huhu, Spotify) .- The camera in video mode is stored as a standard HD with 30 FPS, which can be changed in the settings, but should. There were a few jerks at 30 FPS for moving people in daylight. At 60 FPS in HD that is no longer noticeable and at 4K, the image is then outstanding. Disadvantage: 1 minute 4K equals 400 MB. Otherwise, we've experimented a lot with the portrait mode, which puts people (and objects) in focus and blurs the background. Looks great and fun. For users like us, who did not know that from the 6s, almost a reason to buy. Also normal photos look great, but as I said: the portrait mode is just the most fun (see pictures attached) .- Face-ID and the new gestures: here we were the most skeptical. Over the course of time, the homebutton has finally become dear to the heart, the fingerprint has been recognized quickly. How should Face ID come along? Answer: pretty fantastic. Setting up was fast, unlocking the screen is very fast and intuitive (you do not think you have to stare at your smartphone to unlock it). Even in completely dark rooms Face-ID works perfectly. The new wiping gestures are so internalized after a day that one thinks one would never have used the iPhone otherwise.- The software: here we only have to say that apps or websites are loaded with an impressive speed. In addition to the usability of iPhones you fly through the Telefon.Wir we can after this first weekend no major criticisms (except for the subtle streak while scrolling). Apple has managed a great iPhone and adopted the design of its predecessor. We really enjoyed it. And yes with the Animojis (which you can also save in the Fotoapp and then send via WhatsApp). Thank you for reading.
6810	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	ECR	4	Customs not included - my mistake	2017-11-15	de	Goods arrived on time. But what was my mistake. I have not looked from where I order and have again paid extra duty for 2 devices 400 euros you have to then as plus plus einberechnen.
6811	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Josef Z	5	The latest generation Iphone	2017-11-27	de	The iPhone X is already different from its predecessors. Of particular note is of course the almost borderless display with the characteristic recess on the upper edge of the display, where the camera and sensors for the Face ID are housed. At the same time, Apple's typical home button is missing. But the display extends almost to the lower edge of the case. The side edges are about as wide as the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Although the display is not completely borderless, as it is known from Samsung's Galaxy S8. Apple uses the iPhone X for the first time an OLED display. It is sharp and bright enough, but when compared with the LCDs of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, it is noticeable that it looks noticeably darker at the highest brightness level than the conventional iPhone displays. In portrait mode, the two tabs on the right and left of the front camera are mostly used used to display time, wireless connections and battery level, backed by the background color of the respective app. Even with apps that use the entire display in landscape mode, the "notch" has not attracted attention so far. More conspicuous is that many apps in landscape mode (still) do not even use the entire display of the iPhone X. Instead, black bars are displayed on the right and left. When using the iPhone X, Apple users have to get used to it. The home button as a central control falls away. But as big as initially feared the change is not. Instead of pressing the home button to return to the start page, you now wipe the bottom of the display. The message center can be reached at the same place as before by wiping in the middle from top to bottom. Only the control center has found a new home. You have to swipe from the top right into the display. The only handle that may need some practice is the app changer. To open it, you have to swipe up, hold on the screen and release. If you continue wiping at the wrong moment, you end up back on the homescreen. But after a few attempts you have the hang of it here. The iPhone X has a lot of new features, most notably the almost borderless 5.8-inch display, which packs Apple in a just handy case. The margins leave a little margin, it would be even borderless. The change, which brings the missing home button with it, does not turn out as serious as feared. Above all, the unlocking by Face ID is really fast. The iPhone X makes a good first impression in any case. Apple delivers a high-quality smartphone, which in spite of the many changes is ultimately a typical iPhone, but for which one must also really dig deep into the bag. Look also on my blog: isartest enIf you think my rating is good, I would happy about a "" helpful "".

6816	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Stev	5	Once iPhone, always iPhone!	2018-04-29	de	Apple has done a great job again! Face ID is a force, the new gesture control without homebutton as intuitive as if you had never used anything else. All apps back in place, okay, check some passwords and settings, but that's peanuts! I switched from the iPhone 6 and it's worth it!
6817	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Lars Wisotzky	2	Phone is okay, iOS for me an absurdity	2018-08-19	de	My first IPhone, provided by the company. With, it was clear that it would be a change. But I did not expect that much regression. After 4 months, my impression does not improve. Especially since the operating system is inflexible, inconsistent and not very user friendly. And that's what most Apple users did. The keyboard of Apple zb. Is inaccurate, makes less clever correction suggestions, special characters only with switch. This can be done better. Siri, well. Acts somehow like beginnings of assistance. Back Button is on the top left, often swipes (but not always) and other apps is built back down somewhere. Experience with Amazon Music: Music download in the app is blocked by Apple. Well, congratulations. Furthermore, I notice that inapp purchases are often more expensive than Android. Myibidder costs nothing on Android per bid, with Apple 50 cents !!! To the phone: basically the hardware succeeded. Display good, camera very good (the shots with weak light are bad). Face recognition good, annoying in the car holder. Banking release with face recognition great. Battery okay to very good. Sometimes empty, sometimes it lasts forever. Wireless charging works great and is convenient. My conclusion: who uses and likes assistance systems is wrong here. There are many restrictions associated with the phone. If you like the Apple world is certainly well served with the hardware.
6818	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	HoKe	4	iPhone X - the first impressions	2017-11-09	de	My expectations were huge after all this media hype ... First of all, it cuts a very fine figure, is extremely high-quality and stands out completely from old iPhones. Actually, you do not identify it as an iPhone right now, so it's very futuristic. Unfortunately, it also looks extremely fragile, which of course is due to the design. Reasonable protective covers are thus appropriate. The display is large, unusually shaped and impressive, although in my estimation the distance between the 8er LCD and the X OLED is not so large. Both technologies represent a sharp picture, unfortunately clouding the X a not insignificant disadvantage of the picture. Even with a slight inclination, the display is bluish and I found it annoying. Apple has special quality requirements, which unfortunately were not fully met in this case. The recess in the display, on the other hand, did not bother me much, the "" Notch "" is just one of them. Another problem is the green line bug (green line on the edge of the display), which did not occur on my review unit, but on some other devices. The usability is very good, the omission of the home button was a good idea and used to the intuitive gesture control you look very fast. Fast is also the hardware, very fast. The iPhone flies only through the controls and apps, the cheaper 8er there but no difference. At the end of the bill comes. Personally, I find the X interesting and nice but overpriced. A technology leap that Apple can pay very well. Annoying also the currently long delivery times, as Apple has clearly missed the train. This opens the doors to rogue traders. I was impressed by the X but it did not blow me away and in 2018 comes a new iPhone, hopefully with no blue cast and a bit more resilient and then I like to pay the bill. Until then, I will gladly continue testing it ...
6819	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	alexander	5	Face ID, a dream	2018-03-19	de	I bought the Xer in the Apple Store. In addition a leather case and a protective foil via Amazon. Although the iPhone has crashed a few times from about 1m, it still has no damage. So if you are careful, the fragility is kept within limits or no longer a problem. When I first set up the iPhone, I found it incredibly ugly and especially the silver stainless steel frame looked very cheap for me. I got used to it quickly and now I think it's the most beautiful iPhone. For me an absolute plus is Face ID. The iPhone opens the preview of the news on eye contact. Never again enter any passwords at the App Store or online banking. No back and forth on the fingerprint sensor.

6822	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Daniel Brendel	5	First IPhone X	2017-12-18	de	I have now bought the iPhone X. Ahead of time said that I had an iPhone 7Plus and an iPhone 8 Plus before. And I have to say really - WOW! This is the first iPhone, where the price is really justified. Everyone else always say that the Notch should be disturbing, but I just think the Notch damn "sexy". Performance and design are really great together. Real class Habdy and 1000% recommended
6823	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	LosSantosGamer	4	An almost perfect smartphone	2017-11-19	de	Apple launched the mobile phone revolution in 2007. The iPhone. Every year since 2007, new iPhones have come on the market every year, but Apple eventually lost the innovation and brought a completely outdated design with some technology from the middle class on the market. This year, however, Apple celebrates the 10-year iPhone anniversary and the MUST be something special! And it was something special. First the iPhone 8 came out, which relies on the well-known design of the iPhone 6 and the much interesting device, the iPhone X, with which Apple dares a complete new beginning. Could the iPhone X convince me? The design of the iPhone X has been completely redesigned. Instead of thick edges on the front one sees almost only display. On the one hand, that's really good, as the iPhone X is definitely future-proof. On the other hand, Apple has opted for a recess at the top of the display, the so-called "Notch". Many are bothered, I'm honest too. Especially with videos and games, the Notch is simply bad, as evt important areas are lost. On the back we see a dual camera, which instead of vertical now horizontally arranged and I like so much better. However, I do not understand why Apple has put on so much in this day and age, causing the iPhone X to wobble on the table. Otherwise we only find the Apple logo. The material is set on both sides of glass, which ensures an extremely high-quality feeling in the hands. The frame is made of stainless steel and is in glossy, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8 (Plus) and Note 8. Unfortunately, was renounced on a headphone jack and Apple continues to rely on a Lightninganschluss, instead, as any other, on USB C. The design I can only say: There are many very good ideas, but in the iPhone XI, Apple could certainly revise something. The display dissolves with 2436x1125p and is thus sharper than that of the iPhone 8 Plus. The panel measures 5.8 inches and covers almost the entire front. In addition, Apple installed here for the first time an OLED panel. This panel comes from Samsung, but Apple took over the calibration. This also explains why the iPhone X Display is slightly worse than the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.Although you can see a difference in sharpness between 1125p and 1440p only with direct comparison, however, the viewing angles for an at least 1119 ¬ expensive smartphone do not really convince. It quickly comes to a blue cast that did not have to be. In addition, the colors are not quite as good as Samsung. That is a purely subjective opinion. I'm just more the friend of a little bit more gaudy displays. However, black levels are OLED-typical on point and the sharpness is also convincing. Whether 1125p or 1440p is really obsulät. The brightness is great. Here, the iPhone X can definitely beat the Galaxy S8 (Plus). Compared to the Note 8, the iPhone X has to fight though. For the average user: The display will satisfy everyone, unless you expect absolute perfection. However, the workmanship is perfect. It wobbles or creaks nothing, the keys are excellent press and the device is pleasantly large and leicht.Das system is iOS 11. iOS 11 has been specially adapted for the iPhone X, so there are many innovations. On the one hand, the home button falls away and is replaced by gestures. If you wipe from the bottom up, the app is closed. If you wipe from the bottom up and go slightly to the right, so the "" app field "" as I call it and so you can close background apps. I like gesture control much better than the old Homebutton approach. Generally, iOS 11 is even easier and tidier. If you swipe down from the top right corner, the Control Center will open, where you can turn the WLAN on and off, enable / disable GPS and do some other things. The concept is the same as Android, but the overview is completely different. If you swipe down from the top left, the notification field opens. For this I can say practically nothing, that it works practically identical, as with Android.The fact that iOS 11 again looks tidier and is so, the iPhone X runs without slowing down. The overall operating speed is excellent and just as I expect from a 1119 € smartphone. But Apple has always been able to! The iPhone X has completely forgotten one thing: There is no fingerprint sensor anymore. The feature, which has always worked very well at Apple, has been abolished and the box is free for Face ID! Face-ID was developed so well that it could replace Touch ID in the long run, if Apple changes one thing: the swipe from the bottom up to unlock the device. Setting up Face ID is really easy. Just turn the face 2 times in a circle until the registration is complete. After a short training phase Face ID also reacts wonderfully .... even in the dark! A recognizability I guarantee to 98%. However, Apple could have intigrated the fingerprint sensor into the Apple logo, which would have simply brought the certain Coolnes factor with it. Pity! But Face ID works wonderfully. And with Face ID come the Animojis, which are actually pointless but fun. However, I have only used this feature 2-3x. The dual camera has been improved in my opinion by the iPhone 8 Plus again. The main sensor dissolves in 12 MP and can record videos in 4K60 FPS! At 1080p even 240 FPS are in it, which is incredibly good! In addition, the dual camera with OIS, so an optical image stabilization therefore, making photos and videos look even better. And even though the main bezel is at F1.8 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 at F1.7, the iPhone X delivers the best pictures at night. The second camera also resolves with 12 MP, but has only one F2.4 aperture, which is accordingly weaker light. In the interplay, the images are wonderful and the optical zoom provides even the maximum zoom still decent results.Here, Apple has definitely caught up! However, I would have liked a few more settings options. Especially with the ISO value, I would have wanted to screw a little more. Since Android is more open. The battery has a capacity of 2716 mAh. Sounds a little, but in everyday life, the battery delivers solid results. 1 to 1.5 days, I come with active use easily, 2 days, but I make it more difficult. At 12-13 hours working days, I had to hang the iPhone X in the evening at just 3% battery power back to the mains and had to wait relatively long, until the battery was full again, because Apple, despite the imen high price, no Fast Charging power supply mitliefert , Sad! And wireless charging was synonymous with my S8 charging cradle somehow not. Have it then tested again with the S8 of my sister and it worked out. Pity! The battery itself but at least 1 day durch.Alels all I can recommend the iPhone X. It's a great smartphone with a strong display, a super processor (A11 Bionic), a great camera, excellent Face ID in various other things. However, the Notch bothered me again and again, a fingerprint sensor would have been quite possible and why Apple mitliefert no Fast Charging power supply, is me Schleierhaft. And then the price. For an iPhone X with 64 GB, I pay 1119 €! For my model with 256 GB of memory, I pay 1319 € !!! That's too much. 800-900 € would have done it. And for the fact that it does not learn Apple, finally to install a memory extension with, it is the money almost too bad. If so much money is not too bad, you should buy the iPhone X. But if that's too much money and you want the frameless design, I recommend the S8, Note 8, Oneplus 5T, Huawei Mate 10 Pro etc ... the selection is now extremely large! However, if you can not or do not want to go without iOS, you should grab the iPhone X, or if you do not want to disturb thick display edges, iPhone 8 will be the answer. If you have any questions, please write. Otherwise, thanks for reading and a positive review, I would be happy :)
6824	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	JO72	5	The best iphone, of course	2017-12-20	de	Hello everybody, I share my experiences with this iphone. I had previously Iphone 7 Plus. - Home Button missing I found this "" Button "" really good Fingerprint was detected to 99%. Central point to control the device which I miss personally. Minus gets the X here because FaceID takes much longer than TouchId and the gesture control is not as robust as the Home Button. But now the big improvements: + image is slightly larger than / Plus, OLED shows for me the best picture ever. + Camera, pictures are very good Feels even better than on the 7 Plus, but also represented by the better display contrast. Small criticism in both devices is the format of the photos. That should fill out the HandyDisplay. It does not do it. Is probably small picture format. ++ I can now call and surf at the same time. Who could afford it and Apple lovers, should definitely buy the X. + BatteryWas I noticed that the battery, although similar in size as 7Plus holds much longer , Despite heavy use I come to more than 2 days, if need be, probably even 3 days. For older iPhones, especially the Mobile Hotspot emptied the battery (my 4S was even sucked out in the long run, although connected to power, even the 7 Plus had there still problems), since Apple seems to have improved a lot on the energy management.
6825	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Freak	5	iPhone X (real review)	2017-11-23	de	I would like to write a review here, since I follow this iPhone since the first rumors. The phone lies perfectly in his hand with its stainless steel frame. I am absolutely excited and definitely want it. Unfortunately, it is not my own ^ ^ The sound is clear, no matter if I hear music or call with handsfree. The display is incredibly bright and very colorful. OLED sends greetings! I'm just thrilled and on the other hand, my 8 Plus is very dull:) But now to the "notch problem" which in my opinion is not one. The display is just as big across the image width as the 8 Plus. Then only the rest comes next to the notch. So overall the display is even wider across !!! So no restriction! How to use it later is reserved for the programmers. Edging up is narrower than an 8 Plus, but it is also much better in the hand, in addition to the really handy frame. This is no longer so slippery and the phone is hanging well in the hand. The battery is very strong and holds in my opinion longer than the 8 Plus. But that will bring the next days and hours! So everything I've tested so far, even Face ID works as expected, perfectly! Except for the price, there is nothing to complain about this phone :) but who likes a reliable phone who is also willing to pay;)
6826	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Christian	5	Best Iphone!	2017-11-23	de	I have the Iphone X on 3.11. ordered and on 16.11. I definitely had luck to get one so soon. I had the iphone 4, 5 and 6s and then I waited for something new, since in principle Apple did not really change much. I have to say with the X is definitely I think the design is great, the workmanship is immaculate and for me the most beautiful Iphone. The camera makes very good pictures, the display is great and I do not miss the homebutton at all, on the contrary, I find the wiping gestures a lot better. Face ID also works perfectly. The only thing I think is a pity that you no wireless headphone mitliefert and no Induktionsladegerät.Das the price would have to be already.Absolute Buy recommendation on my part.All other permanent Apple rumhacken should stop buy another phone, there is no compulsion to buy an "overpriced" Iphone. I think other smartphones synonymous good, Samsung and Huawei also make good phones However, I just like the operating system and the performance at Apple simply the best. Therefore, I do not spend the whole day so that I have to bag and have against Samsung ... ;-)
6827	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Fatman	4	Significant progress	2017-12-12	de	I did not want to - but a good offer made me weak then. I have no regrets. Hardly bigger than the 7 Series, it can be operated much better due to the larger screen. The Home Button is missed after a few hours and no longer enjoys the new Bedienlogik.Der screen is incredible. The music player sounds better (just made the direct comparison) and the camera is great. Yes - it is very expensive. But then: I get a great music player, a great digital camera, a sharp Navi and just a lot more. In sum, much more than an Audi MMI, a BMW iDrive or similar offer for significantly more money. So it's almost a bargain. A star goes away - because somehow Apple could at least have a large charger to pack. With the included it loads felt the whole day.

6829	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Jeremy	1	Worst cell phone in the world	2018-10-02	de	Device baptized, tried and thrown directly into the bin! Just dump and spend so much money. Never again iPhone
6830	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	demeister	5	If you want the latest technology, here is well served despite the high price	2017-11-22	de	First of all: This review concerns the device in general, it describes my alltag experience in the last days. I have been using the device for 10 days, a display error or other problems that have been read in the press, I happily did not occur. Closing several app should be optimized in my opinion. Unlocking via Face-ID worked better and better, had first problem with unlocking while wearing glasses. Apple had been right here, the device gradually learns to know its user, so the face ID function smoothly after 3-4 days, even in very poor lighting conditions. Only the battery charging time bothers me a little. My previous Iphone 6s (battery about 1700mAh was fully charged after about 2h, the Iphone X (battery about 2700mAh) needed about 3.5h so soon twice as long Apple would have been able to place a quick charger at this price instead of a standard charger. All the negative reviews regarding wealth and the very high price in my opinion have nothing to look for. Clearly, the price of this device is very high, but should also the innovations of the device and One should also keep in mind the Preisstabiltät the Iphones in comparison to other providers. Therefore, I can say with absolute certainty that this device currently under no circumstances reviews under 3 stars has earned. How the device next months, years interspersed will show up.
6831	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Amazon Kunde	1	No IP67 waterproofing	2018-07-06	de	I'm thrilled by this product but only until I tried the waterproofness IP67 (30 minutes in 0.5 m depth) declared by Apple. After 3 minutes in depth about 30 cm, the phone is broken and I get no guarantee from Apple, because Apple sells to you Waterproof phone but he does not guarantee that the phone is waterproof. I am absolutely disappointing and never buy anything from Apple. 1.100, - EUR I threw away !!!
6832	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Sebastian	5	Top Bounty for those who want it	2017-12-11	de	Absolutely solid smartphone with good new technology, as it should be. The problems that some describe here I can not confirm. The new features are well-developed, nothing that has errors somewhere or anything, I'm happy with it. That's better than the old one is probably the prerequisite if I get such a device, because I think I need not think about it, that should be clear to everyone here. On the plus side, of course, it is at a high level where I would think it scares off customers. I myself got it from the employer, but I would refrain from spending over 1000 ¬ spend. There is really more important in life where you spend your money on than for things that are written off after 2 years. I do not want to influence anyone now, that everyone should decide for themselves. I am since the 3er, users of the devices of Apple and are therefore already obsessively bound to have to take each new but which should not be a shortcoming. All in all, but good device, with which you can work properly.
6833	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Gerhard	1	Very disappointed ...!!!	2018-02-24	de	Despite very fast delivery (Prime customer), the disappointment came promptly when I unpacked the phone and took off the protective film and lifted the display against the light: - ((in the lower section SCRATCHED.
6834	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Enrico	4	Modern, high quality and expensive ...	2017-11-05	de	I can understand that you are upset that this phone is too expensive for the average consumer. I myself can not afford it, but have tested it in an Apple Store and must say: awesome feeling, nice extras and top design. Only the camera, I think not so good. I much prefer this classic camera at Apple. Then there is no "normal" home button like the iPhone 6 (which I own). That's good because the button does not relax after some time like "normal" phones. And the function with dr face recognition is especially handy when driving, but let's face it, who needs it? When driving one should not anyway to the mobile phone! Otherwise, but very cool. But I would not buy it myself because I am satisfied with my good old iPhone 6.
6835	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Nico	1	liquid damage	2018-05-08	de	Irreparable damage due to fluid damage. Device was about 10cm under water for a few seconds. Zero goodwill through Apple. Unfortunately, other vendors in the service scope clearly pick up here. Apple flops. 599 € for the replacement of the device. Display damage remains.
6836	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	S. D.	5	The status symbol	2017-11-20	de	Right at the beginning, I have the Iphone x not yet, it is ordered, the delivery times should also be known here. Of course, I read everything on the net that could be found. And that's a lot like any new iphone. Such interest can not be found on any Android mobile phone. By contrast, the media hype is gigantic and also leads to the fact that the iphones can be sold at all. Whatever and here on Amazon is to read as the biggest criticism of the price is called. If the price hurts so much, why are these people buying the iphone anyway? I myself have always indulged in every new iphone, whether that makes sense, everyone must decide for themselves. Today's mobile phone is no longer just a phone, on the contrary, the phone function is moving more and more into the background. Rather, it has become a toy (see Animojis etc.), more or less like a game console or something. It can also be classified as a mobile PC, of ​​course, the design plays a major role. It was always the same and so it will be synonymous with the X, the highly praised innovations such as super display, Hombutton yes or no, FaceID, A11 processor, etc. If you look at it completely sober, the so-called improvements are not so noticeable and as great as announced. Marktstratiegie !!! People just talk about it. With each new iphone, it is always a new, supposedly sharper display, but if you look closely, the difference to its predecessor is never so great. Sharp are and were all. In addition, you get used to it too fast and then it does not notice anyway. The strategy of Apple is quite clear: An iphone is no longer a luxury item, but it has become a mass product. But with devices like the X in this price range, the iphones will once again become luxury items and thus be satire symbols, as is proven by the constant price discussions. And in the present time, status symbols are more important than many think. However, people also afford the X, which is actually hard to raise these amounts for an iphone, after the delivery then often begins the whining, which is reflected in all the forums. No new iphone will ever be as innovative as the 1.iPhone, the topic is completely exhausted. I'm sure the next iphone generations will be even more expensive and it will now be m.E. always run so that there will be iphones in different price ranges, including an overpriced top model. But if you look at it closely, an iphone 8 plus costs more than 900 ¬, since the difference to X with 64 GB and 1149 ¬ ​​is actually not so big as to take the outdated design, but with current technology. The price is so relativiert.Und if I still have to read that even not included wireless airpods or missing a wireless charging station, I can only laugh. The apple airpods cost around 180 €, who can seriously ask for that a manufacturer of so expensive earphones can settle just so, I do not know the calculation for an iphone, but with such fun, apple will not come on the production costs and the cost of development here knows no, low will certainly not be. I also do not want to know how many employees Apple employs, which are horrendous personnel costs, something like that is quickly forgotten. Of course, it's clear that Apple makes a profit, that must be the goal of every company. These are completely childish ways of thinking and have nothing to do with commercial behavior. I personally did not even want the airpods, I only use beats wireless like studio or powerbeats, but only incidentally. What good is Airpods, if they are not my wish headphones, somehow they would pay me anyway. Then many would say, why the Airpods, better would be a lesser Preis.Man can often read on the net, a cell phone is a commodity: Wrong! An iphone for at least 1149 € is no longer a commodity, it is a valuable item! comparable to more expensive watches or similar .... and so you have to look at it and treat it. As you can tell, this is not a review, it's an attempt to explain how the iphone x can be seen, namely as a design-wise very nice, interesting smartphone with some, but not earth-shattering innovations. I will buy it, but I think it's not a must have, especially if you have other iphones.
6837	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Robert	5	Best iPhone ever!	2018-03-29	de	For a change, I'll keep it short: the iPhone X is by far the best smartphone. Samsung and Android are far behind this premium product and this nagging about Apple is just annoying!

6839	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Tobias Schäfer	3	The truth	2017-11-07	de	Some people here really write a measure or are not real reviews .. "" The iPhone X sets new standards "" "" Best Smartphone "" Etc ... As if there is no other (better) smartphone these days and Apple the first A company that makes a cell phone with the "super new" features like 4K recording, a borderless display, wireless charging or face recognition (FaceID) "- ridiculous these statements here. It's a great phone and looks great maybe it is a great innovation for iPhone lovers, but now just a much too expensive smartphone compared to the equivalent or better competition. It must each decide for themselves what he spends his money. Only a Weltneuheut, like here is often described and associated, it is not, if you look a bit outside the Apple world
6840	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Daniel dB	5	Very good device!	2017-11-02	de	Apple sets new standards with its new battleship IPhone X with the razor-thin OLED display and the double camera, the recordings up to 4K. Of course, one can argue about whether a 4K camera in a mobile phone is necessary.Auch nothing can stutter, that the price of 1319 € is a new record and not from bad parents! So the full score concerns the iPhone XAber quite honestly what has ridden here this third party suppliers or what have you smoked 200-700 ¬ charge more than the manufacturer Apple itself? - by the way I can write this review with a clear conscience, since I am the day of Idea was there and it could test! @ Duke if you are not clear with his financial or not in the pay grade with you should just keep your hands off it. It is not a slap to the consumer, as no one is obliged to buy the IPhone X! @ MoBloS and rubber boss: As I said there are people who could test the iPhone X already and therefore can submit a review! First think and then talk / write!
6841	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	mario	3	matter of taste	2017-11-28	de	Three starsWhy? Technique, equipment and the certain step to be ahead of the others earn 5 points. I have been an iPhone user for several years now and I am thrilled with that. However, I like to leave the exact test reports to people who seem to have their own test lab at home. For the price ...... Wienn I buy at launch the top mobile phone of the competition and to a top memory card with 256 GB, then I am on an equal footing financially. If I sell a cell phone of the competition after two years, then maybe I get 200 euros. I sell an iPhone after two years, then I get half and more. Now that ..... and that's my own tasteThe missing home button and the display are for me an absolute nogo.Beim display I do not mean the technology , Rather, I mean the look. The display looks like a screen protector. On the left and right higher than in the middle, I personally do not like that at all. That's why I decided against the x and the 8plus.
6842	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Frank Haack	1	Bad customer service - expensive repair	2018-03-08	de	Since everything has already been said about the Iphone x, I would like to write something about the "" after "". After my Iphone x fell to the floor and the display jumped, I was in the GRAVIS store. A friendly colleague told me that he has not seen many Iphone X yet and he can not tell me if maybe a sensor or something similar has broken down and recommended that I go elsewhere! I then got the Apple Care Number (0800 ...) called, there they tell me for 4 days now that within a radius of 150 km around my place of residence in the next 8 days no more appointments are free. For more than 8 days, employees can not schedule appointments (in 2018). I was therefore advised to call early each morning and hope that I get an appointment somewhere. The repair of the display costs the way 320.00 €, which should be considered when buying synonymous! I will now sell my broken Iphone X on Ebay and buy a SAMSUNG phone again. Unfortunately my move to Apple was not a good idea.
6843	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	1	Bad	2018-09-17	de	Bad
6844	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Kman	2	Produktionsengpässe? Fail.	2017-11-04	de	The alleged production bottlenecks are rich marketing tricks to make this overpriced price seem normal. Only the 1st batch may be a bit tight. If you could not pre-order one at 3.11 on the 27.10, you'll get one. 21.11 delivered. If you order now after 1 week or after the release only at Apple, it also gets from 21.11.It is the first time that the user experience has deteriorated significantly in an iPhone, because the removal of Home Button brings significantly more disadvantages with the omission of the jack connector. The 5.8 "" display on the paper is even larger than 8plus with 5.5 "". In practice, most apps / videos are not adapted to this stretched ratio. Anyone who has become accustomed to Plus devices, the X-display would be much too small, because areas at upper and lower edges can be hardly used effectively. In the area 5G (if 5g as planned from the end of 2018 standard) X is far behind Note 8 and Huawei mate 10, future-proof in 1 or 2 years, the device is not. With such a 1149-1319 euro device it is already a bit poor. Clearly many problems can be eliminated in the future via software update, if the app developers are already, extra time for a single device variant to invest, nevertheless X is in actual form really no mature product. In China, reseller prices are already just below OVP. It will not be long before the customers come to their senses again and realize how overpriced this Protype is and can not even sell for 500 euros in half a year.
6845	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	elbarto	5	Top	2017-11-06	de	The best thing about the iPhone 10 is the price. Yes, that's right. It is still too cheap. I buy the x just because it's expensive. There is no better mobile phone than the iPhone x.
6846	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Amazon Kunde	1	Totally overpriced	2017-12-16	de	I bought the iPhone outside of Amazon and was previously unsure that it will meet its price. When I got the phone then I thought at first that I will never get my old s8 out of the drawer again but after a short time with the iPhone I did not find it satisfying quite the contrary even I was rather disappointed what I was there for over Had bought 1100 €. Design: The iPhone has a nice and very finished design with the display off. The metal ramen feels very good (better than, for example, the iPhone 8) and gives the device a certain stability. However, if the display is on the whole phone seems somehow immediately cheap rather like a not yet finished and not yet finished covered prototype as a finished iPhone x.Performance -) Display: The display is really good because Apple has done a good job it is on the level of a galaxy s8. Oh yes, the display is not from Apple itself but from Samsung. Apart from the fact that I do not think it's good that Apple praises itself for the display and it was not produced by them at the end, it offers good if not the best black was in a mobile phone. However, it is not as razor sharp as Samsung (and that is one if you have been half a year ago, a galaxy s8 would immediately on) also it is not as bright as the competition. Software: The software is good and clear, but where is the homebutton, which would simply be replaced by a bar that you have to swipe up to get back to the home menu. This is not a big problem at the first moment but it annoys easily even after weeks of use I would immediately exchange it for the homebutton again. Much better this problem would be solved (no more room for the homebutten) with Samsung here there is similar to the iPhone 7 a homebutten without a button. That is the s8 namely by a deceptively real vibrate adjusted. The rest of the software is Apple typical. Personally I would prefer Android with the launcher of the s8 but that's just a joke. Battery: You come through the day and I do not need more. Other: What strikes first (if you take the device in hand) is next to the missing homebutten the missing fingerprint sensor. He was replaced by Face id. This is in good German just a face scanner unlocked your phone. Face id is not bad but I would prefer a fingerprint sensor. The new iPhone :-) possession of the finally wireless charging.Fazid: The iPhone x is not a bad phone and it would be for a price of 400 to 500 euros really ok but for 1100 euros Einstigs price really times overpriced. Especially because with the iPhone x, as with any other iPhone, I always have the feeling of saving the apple at every point - no SD card slot because otherwise you would not be able to demand so much extra storage money - just a display with full HD resolution - Unbelievably small delivery for 1100 € no adapters you have to buy for a lot of money anyway. For Samsung that is different.- cheap China headphone and so on. Because of the above mentioned things and because I have become aware of the purchase of the iPhone x once again how good the Samsung Galaxy S8 is, I have decided to s8 against the drawer If you need a status symbol where he can say wonderful with the iPhone should pick x but who probably have the best and invariant phone should definitely the Samsung galaxy s8, s8 plus or Note 8 because these phones are just better.

6854	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Malabulaba	1	Excessively overrated product with many disadvantages	2019-01-01	de	For iPhone new customers and changeover from Android to Apple with many own files IOS is not usable. Moving from Android is complex and difficult. The app "move to ios" offered by Apple on the Google Playstore on Android often causes problems and does not do what it should. For me it has not worked at all despite the current Google Pixel Phone with Android 9. Also, in the Playstore of some users attached tip to change the aircraft mode has brought nothing. The app is not maintained and updated on Android, last update was Apple in March 2016, accordingly poor with only 2.9 stars, the app is also rated. File System: Umsteiger with its own extensive file collection of images, videos and music I can from Apple just advise against. I have e.g. Over 7200 images, sorted in over 100 folders. When transferring to the iPhone, it is not possible to copy individual folders, but instead iTunes is all diced together in a single folder, it can be in the iPhone only create links of photos. Folders can be transferred, if at all, only manually and individually Folder for folders with a lot of time and only with additional software, with iTunes this is generally not possible. For videos and music, the problem is the same. Furthermore, pictures, videos, etc. can not be stored in their own desired order, e.g. Sort by name or size on the iPhone. Subsequent editing of your own copied photos or videos, changing or deleting names is not possible on the iPhone itself. This works only on PC / Mac with iTunes or alternative software. If you later want to copy more pictures or files you have to be careful that the previous ones are not synchronized. If you then have all your pictures and videos on the iPhone on it and want to switch to iCloud, the system indicates that the existing own photos can not be transferred to the iCloud and everything is deleted. Instead, you have to transfer all of your photos and videos from the PC / Mac back to the iCloud, from there it all comes to the iPhone, there is no other option! Who in the people of Apple is thinking of such a crap?! Incidentally, only 5 gigabyte free on iCloud, who wants more or needs to pay. Browser: The Safari browser (even with Chrome & Firefox!) It is generally not possible to change the view or the font size for texts in the display because Apple does not allow this in the browser. Sure you can zoom with your fingers, only the text is then cut off at the edge and only by eternal back and forth to read.Although there is a special "" reading mode "" but you have to activate cumbersome and only on certain pages and not generally works. For people with less good eyes so not useful! Operation: The operating concept is not thought out and not very mature. The control with the "" side key "" is even criticized by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Press 1x, 3x times, in short press, long press, in combination with the volume buttons, depending on the mode even more or other functions, who should still see through? The control generally without home button, navigation only by gestures, with normal or firm pressure on the display Is that really innovative? On the left side there is a small slider with which one can mute the iPhone. It is recognizable after activation only on a tiny red mark on this switch. There are no visual cues in the display, if you forget to turn the sound back on. Since the very first iPhone, Apple does not think it necessary, a small LED, which informs you about new messages, for example. Instead, you can activate the flash LED on the back. Only good if the phone with the display is up on the table! Warranty / Guarantee: Although the iPhone X is really high quality and very well made, but very fragile due to the many glass. Stiftung Warentest rated the iPhone X even as "the most fragile iPhone ever". "Apple generally gives its products only 12 months of manufacturer's warranty (Apple Care), in view of the pricing policy almost outrageous. From the 13th month you have only the legal guarantee and must be able to prove that a possible defect was already present from the beginning, which is practically impossible. Who full 24 months warranty, including two-way exchange and telephone assistance would like to deep in the bag and book the Apple Care + insurance coverage within 60 days of purchase.Cost: 229.00 eurosExtra 29 euros each for damage to the display, or 99 euros for any other damage.Conclusion: I have my iPhone X from the my assessment of a star refers exclusively to the criticisms mentioned above.Note: factual comments I am happy to answer, but please no policy discussions according to the motto "" Android or Apple "" and no fanboys the Apple simply because it is Apple to praise the sky and nicely with criticism ht can handle! Also on comments like "" was already known before the purchase "" (for example, no separate LED, warranty conditions, etc.) I will not respond, because I consider these things to be relevant. For the rest, there are certainly interested parties and customers who might not know one or the other. I hope that I could clarify something with my review and help with a purchase decision.
6855	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Kai S.	5	Great iPhone	2018-09-21	de	I bought the iPhone X after the product launch of the successor model (XS). The higher price of the new model, I was not worth it because the new features of me certainly not needed werden.Mit the X I am very satisfied. Clearly to the conventional iPhones the operating concept is clearly different in some points but you get used to it quickly. FaceID I find great. As a somewhat older person, I already need reading glasses, but I can still clearly recognize the navigation and displayed information when driving. A nice added value to the previous iPhone 6+
6856	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Bene	5	Smartphone at the highest level	2018-10-31	de	The iPhone X was purchased through the Marketplace at A-Montain. The article was new and sealed. Whether it is 100% virgin, I can not judge, however, because in the sealed packaging dust in the columns around the camera has accumulated. Perhaps also normal for a longer storage or re-sealed refurbished Ware.Ansonsten I can connect to the actual product only the good reviews. Have long wondered if I zulege a Galaxy Note 9, Pixel 3 XL or just an iPhone X. Since I'm still in the Apple ecosystem, the choice fell on the iPhone X for 900 € at the Amazon Marketplace. The display is a dream. Finally OLED and big, without losing the compactness of the small iPhones. For OLED typical viewing angle-dependent color changes. The cameras and speakers are good as expected. Face ID works with me 100% reliable and fast, even in the dark. iOS 12 is expected to be super fast and at the same time super boring. Absolutely recommended for existing Apple customers or those looking for a change from Android.
6857	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	iPhone	5	The "best" iPhone even better.	2018-10-06	de	The iPhone X as premium smartphone in the upper price segment has completely convinced me. My thanks, FaceID would not work reliably, the screen is too impractical, etc. were all unjustified. The smartphone works as an iPhone almost always smoothly and the interaction of software and hardware is awesome. The price is the only drawback with this device, which, however, was never considered a bargain. Apple was always more expensive than the competition, but (in my experience) always reliable (he). So who is looking for a smartphone with a TOP display, a really good camera and a fast processor is definitely right here! I can not complain about the battery life, for me it is as good as always more than a day with normal use. From me, the device gets an absolute buy recommendation for all those looking for a TOP smartphone, if not even the best. I wish all the fun that this device can call their own!

It's also beautiful to look at if you did not put it in a case. Face ID works great with me. Picture quality is outstanding in daylight at night shots can be improved. Video recordings are the best I have ever seen in a smartphone. (2018) The display is a feast for the eyes, but it could be a bit brighter but the colors and the resolution is extremely good.
6859	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Drinking Glue	1	The last dirt	2019-04-09	de	I was always very happy with the previous iPhones, so I put up with the damn high price for the 256 GB model. The iPhone X is just garbage. The touchscreen is not responding properly. At the edge, movements with the finger are not recognized or not recognized correctly. Zooming with the 2-finger gesture works in Safari only randomly, because as soon as you take your fingers off the screen, the zoom effect is back to standard back. Apart from the incredibly poor operation, not even Apple works since the last iOS update Carplay right. There are always disconnections and Apple support does not help you. There are only "" you have already tried another cable or iPhone "" standard answers. If you throw € 1,000 in the garbage bin, that's better than buying this phone. At least you will not have any trouble after the purchase.

Had the iPhone 6 6s 7 before and was very satisfied. The x finally has a different design which is why I skipped the iPhone 8. Also handy is that you can charge it wirelessly. I would never buy anything other than an iPhone. Apple simply has the best service with which the Android competition can not match.

Delivery took a few days, but then arrived 3 days before the announcement. Sold by smart tech electronics, really everything flawless! Brand new OVP iPhone also checked at Apple and receive activation mail. I'm very happy with the phone, the only drawback, the battery .... I would have liked here, that you can endure a day well with a load. Unfortunately, one day is a little short for me, partly the battery is empty for the afternoon and has to be recharged. But in my experience has always been an Apple problem. Everything else is top, finally a working cell phone, before a still obsessed 6 which was really no longer usable, because simply too slow and faulty. Would buy the Xer again!
6863	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Niemand	5	Wonderful toy	2019-01-12	de	Years ago, I switched from IOS to Android (Sony and Samsung), as the limitations of the IOS were too stupid for me. Now I am back, because IOS has developed a bit and with the current limitations I can live, especially since there are huge internal memory. And in addition, you can now also external storage anschliessen.IOS is compared to Android by far better, also come bug fixes and innovations quickly. In particular, Samsung's policies are utterly idiotic, and months are waiting for new versions of Android to be made available. And after 2 years at the latest it is over. What is this? The iPhone has been repeatedly criticized the battery. The question arises, what and how is measured. My experience shows - especially in comparison to Samsung 7, which I had before - that the battery, although much smaller holds much longer, since the energy budget is much better controlled. The screen is great, the photos are very good, the memory is sufficient the speaker quality is much better. Cost twice as much, but you also have almost twice as much. And if you are content with the conventional format (iphone 7 and 8) you are not far from the Samsung price and at the height of Sony and recently Huawei.

6879	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Pusheen	4	Apple Iphone X - detailed review	2018-02-15	de	Welcome to my review of the Apple Iphone X. As a small warning to those who do not want to read a detailed review -> Please scroll to the conclusion. Foreword: -------------------- ------------------------ Since I changed my contract to another brand (please leave the stones), because of the high price, me but before I always had an apple in use, I could not get around to take a closer look at the new flagship of Apple. I would not like to make any comparisons to other manufacturers or cell phones, purely objective advantages and disadvantages of the Iphone X. Enjoy reading. Scope of delivery: ------------------------------------------- - iPhone with iOS 11- EarPods with Lightning Connector- Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter- Lightning to USB Cable- USB Power Adapter (Power Adapter) - DocumentationTop Features: -------------- ------------------------------ iOS 115.8 inches Super Retina Display1125x2436 PixelDua l Camera with OIS4K video at 60 fpsA11 Bionic ChipCable charging (Qi standard) iPhone X ------------------------------- ------------- Nowadays, an important experience that open, so I would like to go into more detail here. The packaging of the iPhone X differs at first glance barely from that of its predecessor: The prevailing color of the packaging of the iPhone X is also white. It can be found on the box, which as always consists of two parts and is made of thick cardboard, a product photo of the iPhone X with its Super Retina Display in full glory. The contours of the iPhone has given Apple a high imprint and gives the design plasticity. The paper feels velvety, an impression that also applies to the insides of the cardboard lid. On the short sides is the Apple logo, on the long sides of the manufacturer has the word iPhone applied in the device color. When you open the box, you will first encounter a depositor with the familiar words "" Designed by Apple in California "" is printed. It contains quick start guide and warranty information in different languages ​​as well as the SIM card tool and mandatory stickers. Below the insert is the iPhone X, which is embedded on white cardboard. Below the device Apple has stowed additional accessories. Here is the power adapter and the USB to Lightning cable, which is also needed to charge the smartphone. Here, Apple also adds a headset with Lightning connector, as well as an adapter to connect already existing accessories with the connection of the iPhone X.Iphone X Hands-On (design and workmanship) ---------- ---------------------------------- After years of uniformity, Apple came to the present with the iPhone X, finally there are changes! Instead of the ever-wide margins above and below the display in the predecessor generations of the iPhone, there is now a whole display front, on which the events take place. Almost at least. Apple integrates a bridge on the upper edge of the display, which houses the front camera and the sensors for the Face ID system as well as the upper speaker. Left and right of it - that's why the comparison with a bridge offers - is even more display.Thus, the display of the iPhone X is not really rectangular. The back of the iPhone X is similar to that of the iPhone 8 - here comes back to family resemblance into play. As with the conservative brother, a 2.5D glass surface with depth effect makes for an eye-catcher. Also on the back: the bitten apple, the word iPhone and the iconic phrase "Designed by Apple in California". The proverbial flip side of the flip side: The glass surface is susceptible to fingerprints and other soiling of all kinds. Moreover, there is acute danger of slipping if you have sweaty fingers. The dual camera of the iPhone X protrudes from the back directly. The module is in a silver frame bordered and has a black base area, stands out therefore particularly in the white iPhone X clearly. Unlike the iPhone 8 Plus, the two lenses are not side by side but arranged one below the other, between them is the LED flash. Apple arranges the camera module as usual in the upper left corner of the back. (But unfortunately it stands out again on the case surface ... too bad) The two glass sides are held together by a metal frame. This Apple has polished to a high gloss and thus sets a counterpoint to the design of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. In contrast to the previous iPhones, the frame is a bit more rounded, which makes the device even better in the hand. Overall, the processing of the iPhone X is absolutely high-quality, just as one would expect from an Apple device. Even with heavier loads, the housing does not warp or makes about a muck of itself. Clearances are also not to be discovered. The material selection of the 143,6x70,9x7,7 mm large housing does the rest for the high-quality overall impression of the smartphone, which is rounded off by the pleasant weight of 174 g. In short: noble and successful, makes me almost jealous ;-) this 5/5 stars.Display: ------------------------------------------- - The Super Retina Display, as Apple calls the screen of the iPhone X, is big.In the diagonal measures the display of the iPhone X 5.8 inches, but the aspect ratio of around 19.5: 9, the noble phone still looks very compact. The display area away from the bridge surrounds a uniformly thick border around, making the device in the hand completely in the background - the screen deserves the big stage. Especially when enjoying video content, this is a pleasant and desirable effect. The edge is just as thick that the device can be kept comfortable, without having to worry about accidentally doing unwanted actions with the palm of your hand. The display is based on OLED technology. An OLED display has luminescent pixels, whereas an IPS display must also be backlit. Often, black on these screens seems washed out while it appears clear and dark on OLED displays, because the pixels are simply out in this case - and consume so little Energie.Mit 1,125 x 2,436 pixels, the iPhone X has the highest resolution, the ever had an iPhone. The pixel density is correspondingly high at 463 ppi and makes individual pixels disappear easily. The display is also very bright with 625 cm / m², which results in a good readability even in sunlight. That's why an automatic brightness control, which is preset and for the deactivation of which you have to navigate deeply through the settings, takes care of it. Thanks to the so-called true-tone technology, the iPhone X also adapts the color output to changing lighting conditions. In a cold light, for example, colors are colder and warmer in warm light. This optical compensation is to ensure a uniform reproduction of colors, no matter what light you are in. Technical need, idiosyncratic sign - at the bridge in the display of the iPhone X divide the ghosts. Either one hates the design or one finds it practically (I find actually quite nicely). In the niches, the iPhone X displays information such as status icons (right) or the network operator name (left). The network ID even appears as ticker when needed, because while "" o2-de "" can easily fit in the niche, there is not enough space for "" Vodafone.de "".In the unlocked state, however, instead of the name of the network is the time, which is much more practical, because most users should already be known in any network in which Telefonieren.Die opportunity in which the display really shows what it can, is the reputation of video content. The app by Netflix, for example, is already optimized for the new Apple smartphone and can display content that is already created for a super wide-screen format, even on the entire display. The mystery series "Stranger Things" is a good example. But as impressive as the video on the AMOLED display of the new iPhone generation may look like - it simply lacks a piece of content. Sometimes a head is cut away, sometimes an actor falls into the void, because the control console of the elevator is in the "" blind spot "" of the smartphone. You may get used to it, but just when you have the feeling that you miss something, you are bothered by the jetty (which is a pity and could have been better resolved, but where shavings are known to be shaved) .Steg or not .man does not want to be more papal than the pope, all in all, the display class is 5/5 stars. Equipment and Performance: ----------------------- --------------------- In the iPhone X, the A11 Bionic chip is used, which the manufacturer has also processed in the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. This is much more efficient than the previous generations of A-chips, even as the direct predecessor A10. Apple has equipped the Hexa-core chip with two performance cores and four lower clocked cores that consume less power. So the six-core is to get a better utilization than was the case with the previous model. For the first time, the A11 chip also has an Apple-developed GPU on board, which should also contribute to increased efficiency. To support the computing units are 3 GB of RAM on board. The most important question, you notice something? - but yes, everything is again a bit smoother than the predecessors, but also not as earth-shattering as one might expect. Nevertheless, no interface-element hooks and apps are loaded extremely fast. Unlock with a smile: For a fingerprint sensor, the front-filling display left no room, even on the back Apple waives the Touch ID module. If you do not want to enter a six-digit PIN when activating your iPhone, you will need to use Face ID.An interesting renewal, but somehow strange and strange, I personally missing my fingerprint scanner, until now I was cut off yet no finger ;-) As for the equipment, the iPhone X is a round thing, because maximum performance meets innovation. With the RAM was unfortunately a little annoying, pity. 4,5 / 5 Punkte.Kamera: ------------------------------- ------------- The iPhone X's dual-camera module consists of a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera with an aperture of ƒ / 1.8 and another 12-megapixel camera with a telephoto lens allows a double optical zoom; digital can be enlarged up to 10 times. However, this camera has a different light sensitivity, Apple indicates the f-number here with ƒ / 2.4. Also, the optical image stabilizer is duplicated and should provide for quiet pictures even with a restless hand. In short: terrific pictures, almost like a SLR camera ... so we come right to the supposedly negative point of the camera software ... but only on The first look, here's a little trick: By default, the iPhone takes X photos in HEIF format. Anyone who is frowning on this abbreviation is certainly not alone, why are the photos no longer JPEG files? HEIF stands for High Efficiency Image File Format, for example, highly efficient image file format. However, Apple does not cook its own soup here, as you might think, but takes over a standard from the Moving Picture Experts Group, or MPEG for short. Apple compresses the images according to the H.265 standard, also known as High Efficiency Video Coding, or HEVC for short. This achieves smaller files with less compression loss, but the resulting files can not be opened anywhere. In the settings of the camera, the file format can be changed back to JPEG. Those who want to save space in the highly efficient storage, should pay attention to how he sends the images. Thus, the iPhone automatically converts to JPEG format when uploading the cloud or when sending by e-mail. The Iphone X has a lot of what I expect from a smartphone camera, the "" professional "" features are lacking again, but that one is meanwhile already used by the predecessors ... 4,5 / 5 Sterne.Software and Multimedia: -------------------------- ------------------ The Iphone X comes with the iOS 11 therefore, the control center was redesigned from scratch and the notification area is summarized with the lock screen. Apple has also donated its dark color mode to its operating system. If you like to send screenshots, you can look forward to new editing tools on iOS 11 that also make handwritten annotations on screenshots easy. The function "" outsource apps "" should make full iPhone memory the end. The system will simply delete unused apps, or offload them to the cloud. Personal data and attitudes are preserved and are available with a new installation as if nothing would have been. Also on board and ever more important is the digital assistant Siri, who comes up either in female or male with an even better sounding speech output. But sometimes I feel uncomfortable talking to a smartphone. Class that you can now chat with the wizard. The included apps are getting better. Notes, calendars and memories have become practical tools that help to organize your own everyday life. For example, the calendar can now look for events in emails, sms, and safari, and suggest them at the appropriate location. Also, the app now uses Apple maps to give information about the optimal time to break up. Quite a bit after all these years ...The iPhone X does not have a home button anymore. The functions, which held this, takes over with Apple's new flagship on the one hand the "" side key "" called power button. On the other hand, Apple has come up with swipe gestures to make functions such as the return to the home screen or switching between different running apps as intuitive as possible. So on the iPhone X at the bottom of the screen is usually a horizontal line to discover. To get back to the start screen, this is pulled up briefly. To get the view of the background apps, the line is drawn approximately to the middle of the screen and slightly to the left or right - voilà! The swipe gestures are very intuitive to use after a short familiarization, the homebutton I missed after a short time no longer. A nice gimmick are the Animojis, a collection of 3D emojis that record their own facial expressions and give a voice recording a face without the station has to show its own face. The TrueDepth camera recognizes facial features and can allow the software to mimic the user. Although it's great fun to play around with the feature, the practical benefit is limited because Animojis can currently only be created using iMessage - in addition to the transmitter, which requires an iPhone X with TrueDepth camera, so does the receiver at least once an iPhone with iOS 11, to play the Emoji. I really looked in vain for innovations in iOS 11 - but the operating system of the iPhone X has gained solid new features. A nice update for a nice Smartphone.4 / 5 Stars.Akku: ----------------------------------- --------- Here I would like to go back to my little test that I have performed on any smartphone so far, 8 hours in use (Whatsapp, phone, Youtube, games, music ...) and then 16 hours in stand-by mode (here it is connected to Wi-Fi) .- After 8 hours of intensive use: 64% Restakku- After another 16 hours in stand-by: 57% Total can be said to have lost the Iphone X to 24 hours 43% Battery, which of course varies depending on the use. What I want to note here, a 3D game, in my case Asphalt Extreme, consumed in 30 minutes 10% Akku.Solide power in energy management, pit stops on a charging cable, there are rare. 4.5 / 5 Punkte.Fazit 5 / 5- Display: 5 / 5- Equipment and Performance: 4.5 / 5- Camera 4.5 / 5- Software and Multimedia: 4 / 5- Battery: 4.5 / 5 - Overall: I give 4 stars (why do I explain in detail) So ... after much data and details, the conclusion is ... for me personally a little difficult ... I would not say the Iphone X is the best Iphone ever. It is a successful franchise reboot, a reinvention of the Iphones , Apple has finally arrived in the present with its new flagship. The Iphone X is a powerful piece of technology, it's all interlocking perfectly with each other, as you would expect from Apple. To put it in a nutshell, it just feels "right". "But why only 4 stars will be the one or the other? Other questions that Iphone X is a great smartphone, without question. If not the extremely high price, some would certainly stony me because of that, but still the price / performance ratio for me also plays a role and here it convinces me unfortunately not quite. The Iphone X does not reinvent the wheel, it now arrives in the present and does everything that made up the Iphone series as well as its predecessors and even better. Nevertheless, here's something more ingenuity that justifies this price Nevertheless, I would like to say again: Anyone who plans this year to buy a new iPhone is well advised with the iPhone X. So ... after an endless text, I can only thank for the time and reading sincerely ! :-)
6880	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	JasminSchröder	5	class	2018-08-17	de	I am very pleased the iPhone is new as described and welded the delivery has even been a day less. More is not possible.
6881	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Felicia Sommer	5	Although expensive, but worth the money	2018-08-17	de	This is my first iPhone. I had an LG4 before. I'm glad about my purchase decision. Great phone.
6882	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Christian Vetter	1	Despite throttling outrageously expensive	2018-11-07	de	Considering that the iPhone X is already throttled by software ... Thus Appel itself attests insufficient performance ... the phone is ultimately still a middle class device. To the current courses one must be pretty simple as a user of the now after throttling the X buys already. Definitely never an iPhone again .. as long as the performance of the devices is not even worth half of the purchase price.
6883	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Daniel F.	4	From the Iphone X over all devices back to the X	2019-06-03	de	Yes, at first glance you might think I was a little sick or had too much money, the problem was that what Apple delivers. I had previously the Iphone X and wanted to get me the XS Max. I was one of the first to run around with big devices (note 2,3,4) (Iphone 6,6S, 7 Plus, X) Here I have to say the XS Max was just too big for me. I could not possibly handle it with one hand. Therefore I got the XS. The battery life of the XS is despite 7nm A12 underground and partly worse than the Iphone 8 of my sister. Minimum 20% less battery than the X.Also off to the XR. So I was really happy the battery life is awesome and there were hardly any cuts for me. But after 4 months of using the XR, I'm back to X. After some time, I just missed OLED, DualCam and the thin edges before the X is the better alternative for me. I find that Apple has done everything wrong with this series 2018. Why 6.5 inches and not 6.3 / 6.2. Somewhat smaller stop?! Why not a larger battery for the XS? And why such a neutered XR what also just 849/909/1019 costs depending on the memory?! Everywhere there are compromises and not the right device. Shame! I'm back to the X and miss the runtime from the XR, and the DualCam from the XS.Aber I find the best compromise price and the other criteria is simply the Iphone X and I'll stay synonymous erstmal erstmal.Wenn Apple refills here and not one worthy successor, I will not buy any more products. Despite Ipad Apple Watch and Apple TV.Steve Jobs product policy would never durchgewunken .... 1 star deduction because my device is often very warm and the runtime of the XR despite smaller screen and Oled is worse. The hope lies in a dark fashion in IOS 13.
6884	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Matts	5	Apple, I'm excited again!	2019-04-01	de	Apple iOS or Google Android, I had to answer this question for me first. For this purpose, there was only one thing: I had half an year now an Android Phone from the house Xiaomi, admittedly in a much lower price range. That was enough for me but to answer the question: for me personally (!) IOS is simply the system for smartphones. This for the following reason: actually I find the pricing policy of the company from California quite questionable, say the products (too) expensive. Now the iPhone X itself. I've been thinking back and forth about whether it should be an iPhone with a classic home button or an X. My consideration: I get a handy smartphone with more actual display area at the X and that's an absolute plus you just have to mention , For News Apps, I see more of the text. More from the video on YouTube, more in photos of this, top! FaceID was a necessary innovation and this just works 1A. Whether in daylight or lowlight, with or without sunglasses, behind it is a sophisticated algorithm that obviously only a few key features of the face correctly needed to recognize the respective user. What was particularly important to me? The camera, battery life and the display. Let's start from the back: the display (OLED) is "premium" for me. The resolution (ppi) is very high, so it stands out against the Xr, which I did not buy for exactly this reason. The color space is without measurement already felt larger than other smartphones I had in the hand, the contrast as well. I think on relevant websites there are also according to measurements. Also noteworthy: zero "streaking" (Ghosting, clouding is what I think). Of course you can expect the price. But it must also be mentioned that then everything really fits. The battery life is simply very good. The battery itself has 2700 mAh, if I'm informed correctly. That alone is just a component, a smartphone must also have a reasonable energy management. In short: the battery life is great. Yesterday I navigated for two hours continuously with gmaps, photos and videos made all day surfing the internet and had about.30%. Especially when you consider that navigation is a pretty energy-intensive app (processor, GPS and display consistently active) I think that's very good. With normal daily use I get about 30-40% of the capacity over the day, which is why I charge the iPhone usually only to 80%, which spares the battery! Now finally to the camera, for me a top aspect when buying a smartphone. The main camera (s) delivers fantastic pictures. Here I also notice a major difference to Android on: since Apple developed the camera app itself, the pictures are synonymous top and I do not need to mess around with settings, so I expect that, otherwise I can take a DSLR in the hand. For Android, at least I had the impression that the result depends very much on the app used and their own settings. The portrait mode delivers pictures like from a DSLR, of course with lower resolution, the panorama mode is as I already knew it to top level. Of course, "normal" pictures are great as well. All in all, the camera is for me on a premium level, as I expect. I think there's something going on in the next smartphone generations but when I see what manufacturers are already getting out of such a puny lens, I think that's a technical feat in general. The front camera also delivers great pictures for the reduced resolution that it brings with it. Again, the portrait mode is available and really delivers even with selfies amazing results. All other aspects that I have not mentioned now at least for me are not negative. The only thing that could possibly be mentioned is maybe the weight, it could be a bit lighter. But hey, somehow it is clear that all the technology, battery and the high-quality housing weigh something or "I can recommend the iPhone X until now, have it for about 1.5 months. I also recommend it before the Xr because of the display (OLED vs LCD, resolution ppi) and the camera and compared to the Xs because of the slightly better price. If you treat the phone well, you should not forget that iPhones also have a good resale price i.d.R. A TOP smartphone that convinced me that there is still innovation in Apple.
6885	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Tech-Noir	5	Again and again...	2019-02-12	de	Have the X, coincidentally, since it is on the market, so for quite a long time. It's still THE phone for me. Everything works like the first day. Maybe that's why. Initially, in addition to the seven-euro case was still a screen protector on it, but I have removed after a week again. It does not really fit, because of the arched glass. Dust and dirt then collects between the case and screen protector - so no eye-catcher. The sheath protrudes over the edge and that's enough for me. I would like the original from Apple, the leather is already cool, but I do not like the bulge for the speakers. But this is now a minor matter ... The X can be operated super, the home button was never missing, on the contrary, the intuitive wiping I already knew of Nokia's N9 and it was time that other phones have this feature. Face recognition is great , but I would wish that this also works in the car (holder). From thirty centimeters is over. I think that's because the eyes can not be captured properly anymore. (The phone can not unlock even if I'm sleeping). Videos look better than photos. The display is excellent. Even after hours, my eyes are not annoyed. That's probably the OLED. As a Navy (etc.) offers the size of the display in relation to the size of the phone real advantages, even if I think of iPhone 7 (also a super mobile phone) or 8. A battery has my phone too. When it's empty I charge it up. Goes almost everywhere. IOS is pretty good. Unfortunately, Apple does not call me to ask what could be improved. The price was and is insane - but would buy it again anytime. If it's too expensive, buy a Simson. At the moment, however, the phone is almost 300 euros cheaper than the market launch - I think that makes the X a snap. And if I can do without a navy on the way, I still have the SE. That's it. With original Apple case.
6886	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Jan-Hendrik Kock	4	Basically very satisfied	2018-11-23	de	Last year bought in December, my first Apple device, before that I had a Galaxy S7 edge. One year later I'm still completely satisfied. I miss a homebutton absolutely 0 and I do not want to miss the gesture control and face ID anymore, one got used to it and it is absolutely intuitive to use. After 11 months of intensive use still a battery state of 94%, great value. The device is currently running smoothly with iOS 12 this year, better than with iOS11. The only shortcoming I would cite the camera, which is certainly not bad, but I could last year, in my opinion, not keep up with the competition. But as I said, it is anything but bad. For the price absolutely top in 2018, you should ask yourself as a user only the question iPhone X or Xr if you want an iOS device and do not want to spend "" so much "".
6887	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Marc Noack	2	Good but bad ...	2019-01-02	de	A good device, but I still forgive only two stars. I bought the iPhone in December 2017, so it has now "tested" a good one year. I think on the basic materials and on the software, I do not have eingehen.Was the quality Furthermore, the fact that iPhone scratched extremely fast, especially the frame, which is why I use an armored film and a protective cover, does not look sooo good, but otherwise the iPhone would not look good long. What the price / delivery / quality concernsThe iPhone cost 1,149 Euro and that's really hard. The package is nothing special included, I would have liked an alternative to the wired headphones in particular. In Decmeber 2018 it was time, the touch screen made great problems, hardly responded. From the next Apple authorized dealer, matching the problem, Apple has just launched a recall, waiting for the repair 1 month, there is no loaner. So you buy a premium product and then the service is, well ... If you now compare the iPhone with the Huawei P20 Pro (which costs less than half), the question is "what exactly is so much better on the iPhone now, what makes the enormous higher price? ". I can not answer this question, because other phones are at least as good. So the iPhone X is a good phone, but it is not better than others and it is worth the extra price by no means. For me it is therefore the last Apple product I bought, because I do not want to support this exaggeration.
6888	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	TM	1	Design, Weight, iOS Bugs	2019-05-22	de	The design is beautiful, no question. Unfortunately, it needs to be protected, ideally immediately. Thus, the iPhone X looks with shell, like any other phone. Without a cover, this phone loves to slide down everywhere, because glass is smooth. And glass is heavy too. The iPhone X is very heavy compared to other smartphones. This annoys especially with prolonged use and in your pocket. Furthermore, iOS 12 is full of bugs. FaceID suddenly stops working. Screentime names of the devices do not match. Websites can not be scrolled. Text flickers. The quality of the camera is nothing special. Without additional apps, photos can not even equalize. The operation without Homebutton annoying. Again and again nan unintentionally triggers screenshots. Installation of apps with a double-click is cumbersome. If problems, the Apple support arrogance is hard to beat. In summary, no innovation for the inflated price.
6889	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Amazon Customer	5	Does not produce true H.265 files	2018-12-02	de	Even if you have Adobe Premiere Pro CC installed (which has hitherto processed any H.265 file up to 8k resolution without any problems), any attempt to open the not completely compatible Apple MOV container of the iPhone X, together with the HEVC files of other manufacturers, will result in to a crash of the program. And that, as soon as one clicks on the Apple files in the library only! Unfortunately, one has no choice but to post-process the videos before offering them to other websites for sale. For while even a simple 4K camcorder like the Panasonic HC-VXF11 makes the night practically the day and you can still see the blue sky over the city at 2 o'clock in the morning, the iPhone X videos show only deep black areas in the same places. If you then move the exposure control upwards, not more details will appear. The black areas just turn into rushing gray! Maybe Apple should disassemble a Huawei phone and find out how they turn their videos at night. There are real worlds in between on dark streets and neon-lit clubs. High tech scrap is everywhere. But for the price you really expect something else.
6890	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Xoxo	5	A piece of high-end!	2019-03-16	de	Have the iPhone X with 64 Gb for 1 year in the possession and I'm quite satisfied! The display is amazing! You get used to working without the HomeButten very fast. Crisp pictures and the madness 4K at 60 frames per second is awesome! Processing is noble and high quality. Ergonomic housing and is super comfortable in the hand. Due to the glass back it is slightly slippery, but in combination with the original Apple Leather Case the whole is super finished! The price is of course pretty high .. I decided to get 64 Gb and upgrade iCloud to 200 Gb. I am very satisfied and can only recommend the device!
6891	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Fraenky	1	Sorry, I was very hot !!!	2019-03-22	de	Did not buy the iPhone x here but at another provider. Unfortunately, I realized that my new iPhone has always become very hot. The battery then empties from 100% to empty within an hour. There were no apps or anything open during this time. It was from now on the same hot, have been buying other models for some time. But I did not know that problem. Often it was not even used when it got hot. Already sad for this price. My went back to the seller after a few days.
6892	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Bernhard Konrad	5	Has everything flipped perfectly	2018-08-08	de	I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone X. There were several natural options to buy the device. Ultimately, I decided for the first time to buy me a mobile phone on Amazon. The phone was packed very well. It was in an original packaging, which was also sealed. Thus, I can not understand some feedback here, that should be used here cell phones. All the best, I'm satisfied.
6893	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Hallo	1	The phone comes from Italy	2018-11-22	de	Unfortunately, I'm not so happy because the phone is sent from Italy. Unfortunately, I have to send it back because an Apple employee advised me to do so
6894	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	traeumer24	5	It's been said so much ...	2018-04-23	de	... about this noble part, and professional-competent reviews are certainly a better guide. But I want to highlight an aspect that is not naturally so much in the center of interest, but for me as a hearing impaired was the key argument, which is why I have now "switched from Android to IOS" "and just me for this perfect device ( Design, appearance and functionality): The direct streaming of telephone (call and conversation) and all other audio services on compatible modern hearing aids via Bluetooth means a gain in quality of life, for me in addition to everything that still offers such a mobile phone , is enormous. In contrast to Android, this direct audio streaming is integrated directly into the menu at IOS and in my opinion testifies to a committed developer horizons. The full functionality of the hearing aids is also displayed, so that the mobile phone serves as a complete control unit for the hearing aids (this is available for my hearing aid brand via app, in contrast to the use as wireless headphones for selected Android devices). Yes, and in my device, everything works great ... Maybe for others, another great purchase argument?
6895	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Glotrex	5	A great device!	2018-03-08	de	Have now been a week the Space Gray with 64 Gb and I'm totally excited! The display is amazing! FaceID is easily detected with scarf, hat, glasses, baseball cap etc .. Sharp sharp pictures and the hammer 4K recording with 60 frames per second !!! The design and finish typical Apple high quality and feels like a high end top device in the hand. Due to the glass back it is slightly slippery, but with the original Apple leather case nicely finished, so that the device is protected and gets a great grip. The price is high ... 64 Gb is really too lean for such a device, which alone requires the iOS a lot of gigabytes apart from then synonymous of the 4K recordings. Have it but nice with iCloud upgrade to 200 Gb solved! A great piece and absolutely to be recommended!
6896	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Raiden	5	Great phone!	2018-03-22	de	I switched from the 6s to the X and very satisfied Face ID works fast and easy, I have the feeling that the more often you unlock the cellphone it goes the faster. The mailed by the dealer from Barcelona was also absolutely smooth. The phone was versiegetl delivered to me without SIM lock. And I still trust Apple more with my personality date than a cheaper manufacturer.
6897	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	David	5	Very convincing device	2018-01-28	de	I switched from an iPhone 6s to the iPhone X, apart from the price I'm really blown away. Face ID works 98% of the time, as good if not better than Touch ID. Since I work as a car mechatronic Touch ID often times did not work, because I had very dry hands or had a scar from time to time or scratched Finger.Haptik, look and quality is of course Apple typical non plus ultra in my eyes. The new Camera and the OLED display are just terrific! The price is of course very high, but everyone has to know whether it is a value or not. Since I need my smartphone very often due to a quick change in my job and also need it more often, I was well worth the price.
6898	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Sonja A.	5	new Apple users	2018-05-09	de	I do not know if I'm the right person to review such a product. The Iphone x is the first Apple product I own. Previously, I was a self-confessed supporter of Samsung. Am still synonymous. Small vorgesichte how it came to my Samsung Galaxy S8 has a massive display damage and the repair would have cost me just 300 ¬. Since I wanted to get me a good travel camera (which is synonymous with just under 700/800 €) both was unfortunately not an option. With a broken display to walk through the area but unfortunately not. So started the search for a cell phone with a great camera. Since I had exactly 3 devices to choose from. Iphone 8 plus (which is too big and unwieldy for me), The Samsung Glaxy S9 (unfortunately at the time only 4 weeks on the market and as new phones mostly bugs have much synonymous out this) and then last but not least the Iphone X. .  What can I say. I am more than happy. And that says a bislnag Apple supporter. I am frog that I have chosen this device. Due to the fact that it has no button any more, the handling is similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8. The photo quality (which is important to me), I think for a cell phone really outstanding. It will now be put to the test in the upcoming holiday, but I'm really looking forward to trying it out. The operation is easier than I thought (but I'm convinced that it's because the phone has no homebutton anymore). The display sharpness and color scheme, I think synonymous really good. Unfortunately, I can not score with so much technical knowledge. I can only say that the battery lasts longer than my Samsung Galaxy S8. The only disadvantage compared to the Samsung is actually that no fast charging cable from Werkauf is here. This is sometimes a bit annoying and I had to get used to something. But otherwise it covers almost all areas of the Samsung. I'm really excited about the Iphone X: D
6899	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Andreas	4	An almost perfect smartphone for technology enthusiasts	2017-11-21	de	Since unfortunately there are a lot of fake reviews written here or it is in part to no real reviews but rather I have pre-ordered my iPhone X on October 27 and received last week and could therefore make me a few days of it. The exact technical data, etc. can indeed be taken from the Apple page, so I would rather go into the actual user experience and show what I noticed in the everyday use positively or negatively. To the device: The smartphone itself is - as to this Price but also to be expected - absolutely immaculate and looks like a piece. Haptic makes it a high-quality impression, lies comfortably in the hand and has a nice size as I think. Only the protruding camera unit is a tiny drawback. The speakers provide very powerful and clear sound, the display is razor-sharp and really impressive due to its high contrasts and almost framelessness. The "" notch "", ie the indentation for the front camera or the sensors disturbs in everyday use not at all. Operation: The omission of Homebuttons brings so some peculiarities in the operation with it. Many functions are realized with new gestures, which quickly become flesh and blood. The commands are almost always well recognized and therefore the Missing Homebutton does not bother me at all. As a changeover from Android to iOS, I had to get used to the new operating system. This also worked very quickly, but I have to say there are a few details here and there, which I find suboptimal solved. For example, that the camera app offers no manual mode and also the few settings for the camera are not found in the app, but in the general settings.But the perfect operating system is not there anyway, even Android has its peculiarities. Who already uses an iPhone, will feel at home on the X immediately home. FaceID: The widely advertised new feature, namely the unlocking of the device by means of face recognition is unfortunately a double-edged sword and actually almost the biggest criticism for me. On the one hand, the face recognition works in most cases very reliable, even in complete darkness, on the other hand, such a fingerprint sensor but still faster and, above all, you can unlock the device already while you just pull it out of your pocket. In addition, you can unlock a device with fingerprint sensor times quickly, for example, if it is next to one on a table. With FaceID you have to take the phone each time in the hand and hold in front of the face. It is complaining at a high level, but the classic fingerprint sensor is my personal favorite. Finally, a few positive / negative aspects that I have noticed: + very beautiful, high-contrast and bright display + battery life for my needs more than adequate + cameras allow the layman beautiful and professional-looking shots + the new aspect ratio of Displays are particularly noticeable in websites with text positive, because here again just a few more lines fit + Inductive charging works comparatively fast and comfortable- Unfortunately, only a standard power supply included. Inductive charging station or fast charging section must be purchased separately. Weak performance at the price. - By arranging the keys, when I'm unlocking or invoking Siri I often happen to accidentally take a screenshot (the power key and the opposite volume key must be pressed at the same time) - Many apps are unfortunately not yet adapted to the aspect ratio and the extra space on the display is lost by black bars. The popular apps like Facebook, Whatsapp etc. but already use the full potential.- some gestures are often not recognized correctly or are more complicated to use than with a dedicated home or back button Conclusion: Overall, the new iPhone X is a successful Device that, as expected from Apple in the absolute upper class plays along. Compared to the iPhone 8, it is almost revolutionary, since the latter is almost only a mild development of the iPhone 7. This revolution can be paid well but Apple, the X is without question a luxury item and status symbol and especially for technology enthusiasts and Apple fans. If you would like to save a few hundred euros, you might want to look at the iPhone 8, which is virtually identical in terms of performance, but is much more conventional.
6900	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	C. Lampe	1	Face recognition is an impertinence	2018-09-06	de	First off: Of course, the iPhone X is as good as all the iPhone's before him plus various improvements. The missing button is sometimes really missing, but one has got used to the operation by means of finger gestures quite quickly. Why then 1 star? Because the face (not) recognition drives you to madness. It is already stupid enough that you can not unlock the phone - like the one with finger-touch - directly at the elevation. But that would be bearable, if the facial recognition would work at least at the frontal superiority to 95% plus x. In fact, the rate is below 50%, the immediate detection (as in advertising) even at most 20%. If one can believe the traditions, Steve Jobs would have run in the face of such a worsened product probably in the headquater Amok, so it must be enough that he probably turns permanently in the grave. In any case, I have never owned an Apple product that I had to annoy every hour - to the iPhone X. Apple: Put, 6.
6901	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Pseudonym	5	From the 8th to the 10th	2018-02-01	de	Now I went from the iPhone 8 to the iPhone 10 because I wanted a bigger display, and finally Face ID, and it's really very comfortable! Despite the missing home button I get along very well, it would have expected worse! Already used to it after 1 day. And finally an iPhone that does not look like 6,7,8! Battery life is about the same as the 8er.
6902	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	D. K	5	Super iPhone	2018-02-04	de	Best smartphone so far. Battery lasts for me ~ 2 days! Workmanship is incredibly good. 64 GB are perfectly adequate for me. Highly recommended!
6903	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Henning	5	iPhone X	2018-01-25	de	+ Great smartphone, which runs on IOS and not on Microsoft and therefore has a much improved App Auswahl.Das iPhone has a completely new housing and display. It was important to me that I do not constantly have to learn new functions and know how the mobile phone works. Otherwise, I would have ordered the lower versions.- The biggest minus is the much too high price, while the Samsung 8 is also in the same league and cheaper. The many warnings about Samsung 8 (Android) have made me choose the iPhone without being able to compare the Samsung 8 with it. Performance of the two phones are probably similar only the new iPhone X has given me a higher security for the future
6904	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Sheldon	5	Am thrilled	2017-11-30	de	Have the X for a few days now, and I have to say I'm excited. Switch from the iPhone 7 and it's a huge leap. The display is absolutely sensational, the size, the resolution, the representation of the colors, just perfect! Personally, I find Face ID to be a bit more sophisticated and more comfortable than Touch ID, but that's a matter of taste. At least it works perfectly, face is always reliably detected, even in the dark. The use without Home Button goes quickly into flesh and blood, I do not miss the home button. The only criticism, if you can call it that, is the lack of customization of some apps, but that's just a matter of time. Camera is as expected top, performance is great, even nice little things like the X detects when you actively look at the display and when a message or a call comes is automatically silent. So the price is amazing, but after 1 hour of use I did not think about it anymore. Also, setting up with the quick start feature in iOS 11 and my iCloud backup was really easy and ran smoothly, as makes a change fun, as some manufacturers could take an example. TOP And finally again something to the 1 star reviews "overpriced bla bla". Galaxy Note 8 also costs 1000 €, cars for 80.000 € are sold, watches for thousands, jewelry and handbags for thousands of € ... I use a smartphone daily, so why not, everyone can spend his money for what he wants, that's what you work for.
6905	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Martin Biering	3	Great smartphone - without meaningful innovations - and still expensive	2018-03-02	de	About the pros / cons of the phone has been written enough. If you like technical details read reviews.How, what awaits me as a longtime iPhone (6s) users? Apart from the really extremely high-quality processed body, which one will never see thanks to protective cover, initially not much: The data is transmitted contactlessly from the old iPhone. After a few minutes, the new phone looks like the old one. Everything is there where it already was - which one is happy for me somehow now an expression of pure boredom. The "" Aha "" experience stays off. OK, the screen is larger, through the notch a few icons arranged differently. But that brings little if the new space is hardly used. Many apps (such as Whatsapp) have thick, unused bars where the display is now larger. There is not much of an advantage there. Other apps use the new display better. Also in the image quality, I can not see a jump, yes, OLED is on board. The "" old "" display was also very good. Add to that the changing colors depending on the viewing angle (even without TrueTone). Enthusiasm looks different. Face ID works well, GOOD, but not anymore. Gone are the days when you could unlock the phone "" just "" or half in your pocket with Touch ID. Or next to me on the bedside table could read the last message. From now on you can ALWAYS turn your mobile phone around, which works well in many situations - but not in others. That would not be the problem if you did not have to wipe the screen. The fact is, Face ID works, but is more complicated and (usually) slower - I can not see an advantage here. To the camera: That's good, like the old, with the same features ... The new portrait mode is, well, one nice gimmick - which will probably never be used. If I want to do portraits, I use the DSLR with a portrait lens. A much better solution than any software fix. Here's the list of "" innovations "" actually ending. (Animojis are not an innovation for me, but a useless bauble for me) All this may sound like a bad phone, but no, the device is fast, takes good pictures and can do everything you need. But that could be my old iPhone too. The question of whether investing in an iPhone X is worthwhile I can only emphasize with a clear NO. If you reduced it to the essentials you get the same phone as before with a slightly larger display and more complicated unlocking mechanism. Nothing for which hundreds of euros would be worth the price.
6906	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Irmbra	5	Apple iPhone X	2018-01-30	de	The delivery was fast and punctual. I am very satisfied with this iPhone. The read reviews, I can only confirm. A defect I must nevertheless cite: the flyer for a first guide were unfortunately only in languages ​​incomprehensible to me. Why are not these also settled in German? That would be at least a little customer friendly.
6907	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Bruno	5	Great phone.	2018-04-22	de	Nothing else to say. The price is not worth it. There are many other phones that do the same, but for a lower price.
6908	iPhone X	256GB	Argent 	Chakalaka	5	Apple lovers	2018-04-09	de	Mega good IPhone, beautiful design (ordered in silver / white) reminds a little of the iPhone 4 from behind. At the notch and that there is no homebottom, you get used pretty fast. Of course, the price is exaggerated, but for Appleliebhaber I can only recommend it anyway.
6909	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Geert Meerdink	4	Fully okay!	2018-02-23	de	Good goods, fast delivery. As promised. Manual was not there, but to be found on the internet. The usual apps from Apple were already loaded.
6910	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Eagle	5	The best iPhone yet - but it must be at the price!	2018-03-01	de	I have the iPhone X now three months and have it in continuous use. It's true, yes, it is the best iPhone so far - but it must be at a price of about € 1,000 (depending on the dealer, as of, 1.3.2018) For the sake of simplicity, a short listing follows the Pro / Neutral / Contra- Scheme.Pro: - Display, but Notch is a habit at the beginning, but after a while it does not bother me at all, otherwise it's the OLED panel Perfectly illuminated and the color fidelity is very good Speaker: neat for a smartphone control with gestures works very well, the home button is not missing, all major iOS apps are now optimized for the iPhone X Speed: here it is missing nothing, it is also the fastest smartphone for time-processing: at flagship level, the highest quality materials, processed to the finest detail- size of the housing is also great for one-handed operation- Battery: hä lasts 1-2 days depending on how strong you use the smartphone, in addition, the charging option with wireless Qi standard is finally available and faster charging with a strong power adapter (unfortunately not included) - Cameras: very sharp shots and the front Camera captures very nice details of the eyes in selfies, the two rear cameras are good, with these still up potential is present (but is criticism at a high level), especially when Fokus- Face ID: works fine and learns fast In addition, the iPhone recognizes me now even from unusual positions (eg you lie in bed and looks diagonally on the smartphone), in my opinion, much more practical than Touch ID, especially in winter with gloves superNeutral: - games (Animoji o. Ä.) - Telephone functions, the reception is sufficient, but could better-price: contrary to my opinion, I think this is appropriate, you get exclusive key features that the competition (still) does not offer, v. a. Face ID is undisputedly the best and most secure face unblocking delivery: okay, although a quick charger at the price could be there already - 64 GB of memory are just okay with the priceKontra: - jack connection is missing, I can not imagine that it has failed in the field and I also do not understand why it is already removed, where there are very few really good Bluetooth headphones (the trend currently affects many new smartphones) - now and then some apps crash (eg File manager), software updates often help, but sometimes it's annoying. You get a really great iPhone, whose price-performance ratio is quite ok. The positive features are clear, but I would only 4.5 Awarded stars, because the iPhone X is not perfect. Due to the lack of opportunity on Amazon to evaluate a product with 4.5 stars, the rating is rounded up to 5 stars. Conclusion: Despite the high price, I can highly recommend the iPhone X, I'm really satisfied and currently it is the most original smartphone on the market!
6911	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Felle	5	Finally an iPhone with a new design.	2017-11-04	de	In the following report, I would like to pass on my experience with the new iPhone X. I have chosen the 64GB version in the color Space Gray. *** Packaging *** The packaging is typical as you know it from Apple. On the front is now the front of the iPhone to see X.Ein nice detail is that the stainless steel frame on the packaging is again highlighted. In addition, the box is now wrapped in a plastic wrap, which you can raise quickly by means of a tab *** The scope of supply has also changed this year nothing. In addition to the power plug, Lightning cable and the Lightning headphones is also this time again because of the lack of a jack jack steckelegt.Etwas a shame I think that the headphones (and the adapter) even in the last models only stuck in a cardboard holder and not as it once was in a small plastic box. *** Design *** The design is the biggest innovation of the iPho ne X. Finally, the iPhone has received a new design after the last few years. The display now takes almost the entire front, the corners are rounded and fit very well into the overall picture. The above omission for the camera technology made for I like the design well, others not. You have to say very clearly that it is a pure matter of taste. Flavors are different and that's a good thing. *** Processing *** The iPhone X is really top processed , It feels really high quality and you can tell directly that you have to do it with a premium device. At the high price, it would be bad if it were not so. The transitions from the display to the stainless steel frame to the glass back are really perfect and clean worked. There is nothing to complain about. In addition, all the buttons have a pleasant and crisp pressure point without something wobbling. So that should be synonymous. The glass back is very anf mature for fingerprints, in the dark version you can see this even more clearly. The camera on the back is now arranged vertically and stands out a bit again. This does not look quite as perfect. *** Memory *** The iPhone X is If you like to watch movies offline and often shoot videos, especially in 4K, then you should definitely opt for a larger memory option. I myself manage with 64GB memory very well, because Whenever I rotate videos, I always transfer them to the computer to save memory. Here everyone can decide for themselves how much memory is suitable for the personal user experience. *** Display * ** When the display is Apple first on an OLED display. The colors are great, the contrast is really good, the brightness is also very good, even in a brighter environment or outside i m outdoors. The colors are not quite as gaudy as Samsung, but they are very lively and colorful without being too oversaturated. The viewing angles are very good, but not optimal. In a white background, for example, this is a bit bluish In normal everyday use, this is almost never on, but it must be mentioned. True Tone is there again, but I personally think nothing of it. In the iPhone 7 Plus, I've never used this feature , because I do not like the colors and I will not synonymous with the iPhone X machen.Beim iPhone X change the colors with activated True sound just too strong, so it does not look nice. Despite the criticism of the angle is the new OLED Display for me the most beautiful display which ever existed in an iPhone.*** Loudspeaker *** Also with the iPhone X were installed now 2 loudspeakers which should provide for stereo quality. A loudspeaker is as usual on the lower side, the second loudspeaker gives out the sound over the earpiece. The sound is clearly clear and loud and it is fun to watch videos and listen to music. The quality of the speakers is at the same level as the Plus models. I could not find any differences or hear it better. *** Battery *** The battery is indeed a little bit larger than the Plus models, however, I notice in my user behavior no negative and no positive effects. The running time is about the same. Who also came well with the iPhone 7 Plus through the day, will have no problems here .Two days are also possible if you pay attention when using the battery. For me, the battery life is definitely satisfactory. In addition, the iPhone X also supports wireless Charging. All charging pads that support the QI standard can be used. This is actually atypical for Apple, but for the user all the prettier that a widespread charging technology is used. I use the current Wireless Charging Pad from Samsung. Fast Charging also supports the iPhone X. , but you have to buy a separate power supply for it. I did not and I will not in the future. *** Performance *** The new A11 Bionic processor is used. This is the same processor, which also with the iPhone 8 Everything works very smoothly. Whether switching between apps, opening apps, zooming, wiping and scrolling, everything runs very smoothly and quickly. Ruckler I could not find any. Even very complex games run smoothly. Furthermore, AR apps are running without any problems and very smooth. The overall performance and the interaction between software and hardware is really great. Differences to the iPhone 8 / Plus does not exist. *** Face ID *** Besides the design Face ID is the second major innovation. Because of Face ID, there is now no longer the usual Home Button with Touch ID. Face ID is something completely different and in the run-up you really could not be sure how reliable this new technology works in an iPhone. I must honestly say that I am very very positively surprised. The setup is very fast and simple. After the face has been scanned Face ID can be used. On the lock screen is a small lock to see, this symbolizes whether the iPhone locked or unlocked After successful unlocking, you have to swipe up and you immediately come to the home screen. In the beginning, it is a bit strange, because you are in the last year Everything is new, is always unusual at the beginning. But Face ID works so well that you get used to it very quickly. I really did not expect that getting used to so well. With the Time I missed the home button also not at all, at least that's the case with me. In everyday use, I noticed the following things: -As advertised, Face ID also works with a hat, scarf or sunglasses and the same speed.-If the eyes Face ID does not work, even if you close your eyes behind a pair of sunglasses, it does not work.-Face ID works in normal daylight, in bright lighting, under artificial light and outdoors without any problems.-When the room is completely dark Face ID also works very well. -You do not have to hold the iPhone X exactly in front of the face.Face ID works even if you look from the side or from top to bottom.-Face ID can be unlocked This works even faster than it did with Touch ID. So far, I'm really happy with Face ID and it works really well. In the beginning it is indeed a a little bit unfamiliar but you get used to it very quickly. *** Animojis *** Animojis are a nice gimmick and it shows really well what is possible with the new camera, but nothing more. I have to honestly say that this feature at least I was interested in it and I will probably use it as well as never. The technique behind it I like, but everything else is as I said just a gimmick. *** everyday use *** The iPhone X is about as large as an iPhone 7/8 and the display size is about the same as the iPhone 7/8 Plus, but a little bit narrower. You can tell synonymous. Because the iPhone X is now more compact than a plus device, it is also better in Hand.Man realizes clearly that it is not so clumsy and one-handed operation is also possible again. I have rather small hands and still it works quite well. The form factor is really a very good compromise of compact Size and large Display.Außerdem you get the iPhone X now also better in the trouser pocket.Dadurch that the display is a bit narrower than the Plus models, the keyboard was also a little narrower.When typing with one hand, this is an advantage the new gestures, which are now required because the homebutton is missing, are learned quickly and getting used to is faster than expected.Thus, after a short time, you are quickly used to w I need to close an app. There are not yet all apps for the iPhone X adjusted. Unmatched apps have a black bar at the top and bottom. I hope that all apps will be updated gradually and this will not take too long. The change between the apps with the help of the bar at the bottom of the screen is very very fast and flüssig.Die percentage of the battery can only be seen in the controller center and not at the top of the bar. The top recess for the camera is definitely a matter of taste. Some find it ugly the other likes it well. This recess is not as annoying as the beginning perhaps was suspected. Even with videos in full screen mode you take this recess after a short time no longer true and you pay attention. Ich could in connection therewith no negative problems which disturb me personally. The distance between the keyboard and the bottom of the screen is too large. That does not look really nice and it was given away a lot of space. Siri is now activated by the power button. It works just as well as before with the Homebutton. *** Camera *** The pictures with the new camera make a very good impression. Both the colors and the contrast are even better than the iPhone 7 Plus. In addition, the colors look nice natural. Also at In low-light conditions, the camera now makes much better pictures. One can really take first-class pictures. The second lens of the dual camera b there is now also an image stabilization, this is not the case with the iPhone 8 Plus. The front camera now also has a portrait mode.The quality of selfies has become a little better and even if I'm not a big selfie fan I have to say that you can now synonymous with the front camera really good pictures können.Skypen or make calls via Facetime also works in very good quality Video quality is synonymous positively hervorzuheben.4K with 60 frames per second film is synonymous with the iPhone X möglich.Die quality of the videos is very good. The image is super fluid and sharp. These recordings but also need a lot of space. Like nature photography, Videos from and with friends or videos from the family, the camera gives very good results. Right big differences to the iPhone 8 / Plus but there is not. *** Price *** That the iPhone X is again much more expensive, was actually no Surprise as it was already speculated months before. The price has nothing to do with whether a device is bad or good, but I would like to say a few words Maybe I have a wrong view, but there is one thing that bothers me which I have already criticized the MacBook Pro 2016. I think it's not good in what way the prices are raised. Everything is a bit more expensive is unfortunately It started in my opinion with the iPad. It gave the iPad the name suffix "Pro" to make it even more expensive, although the iPad Pro was actually just a normal annual development of the iPad Air . In the Macbook Pro, the touch bar was the big change. But to make the price even more expensive to have a slimmed down version without Touch Bar published. In the iPhone X, it is in my opinion exactly the same. I think you have it iPhone 8 / Plus with the now old and boring design only released to the iPhone X as a "special model" with a significant surcharge to sell. For me is But it is not a special model but the actual iPhone 8.Trotz but you have to say that Apple has done everything right, because otherwise the demand would not have been so great and many others, as well as me included, would not have bought the iPhone X. * ** Conclusion *** Finally, Apple has released the iPhone in a new design. The anticipation was very great as well as the expectations and until now, it has really been fully worth it. The new iPhone X is really an excellent smartphone, with a very nice design (a matter of taste), a great display and has with Face ID a new technology on board which although a little bit of getting used to, but after a short time becomes a habit and reliable works. The high price is indeed a bitter aftertaste but here Everyone has to decide for themselves whether they are willing to spend so much money on a smartphone or rather not. Regardless of the price, I can open the new iPhone X. recommend each case and I am very satisfied with it. You get a both technically and qualitatively very high quality processed smartphone which is one of the best devices on the market today Supplement: I added some pictures, which the iPhone X compared with a Galaxy Note 8 show.The Kicker App is for example not yet adjusted.All non-customized apps have top and bottom bars.The Bild.de App you can see both displays in direct Größenvergleich.Nachtrag 2: Depending on the device, it may happen that at different angles a white background turns from blue to yellow.This little problem can be solved by yourself.1.True Activate Sound2.When Display Adjustments - Activate Color Filter3. Activate Color Touch4. Set intensity between A and T5. Set the color tone between blue and purple (The pens at the top are the orientation) Then the display is as it should be. True tone can then be deactivated again.
6912	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Dreiundzwanzig Klikk	5	The smartphone from the other star	2018-03-25	de	Have this smartphone already 4 months in operation & must say it is a feast for the eyes the display .. the handling the handling Grandios ..

6913	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Patrick	5	Apple's next big step in the smartphone market	2017-12-03	de	I now have the new smartphone flagship from Apple in use. Enough time to give a small conclusion. I will divide this recession into categories, so every self can read the part that interests him. I will deal with the following points: 1. Design2. Screen3. Kamera4. Face ID5. Software6. Power / battery7. InnovationsFinally a conclusion Let's start.1. DesignThe design of the iPhone X reminds at first glance of a mixture of iPhone 4 and iPhone 6. And basically it is. Like the iPhone 4, two glass panes are framed by a stainless steel frame. The shape comes from the iPhone 6th In this point, Apple remains faithful for 3 years.Das weight has changed significantly. While since the iPhone 5 rather lightweights produced by Apple, the iPhone X is now a heavyweight. This weight always gives you the feeling that I hold a high quality in my hand. In terms of design, Apple has not given anything away. Despite the omission of the typical home button, it still has an iPhone appearance. A big difference, in addition to the mentioned Home Button, is the screen. And I'll go to the next point.2. Screen The biggest difference, and basically the difference everyone else pulls, is the screen. If you look at the first power on the display, you immediately think Apple would have just tried everything in space to provide it with screen. This is true. A thin edge goes around the device, otherwise you only have screen in hand. The presentation is just great, this Apple has increased again. When the black levels Apple "finally" "ran to the competition. But this is only due to the OLED technology. A technology that is so new that Android has only been using it for several years. Because sometimes you do not understand why Apple closes itself to such technologies. As in the predecessors, Apple has also incorporated its 3D Touch on the iPhone X. A nice technology, which, in my opinion, is still underestimated.Very sad. Now I have written this above as if the display had not a single flaw. This is true. If the view goes from the bottom up you only see screen, well, until you arrive at the top. Here, Apple has the new famous Notch. An indentation in a near-perfect screen. While in normal operation (read emails, use Instagram) you do not notice this notch. For videos, but this begins. Here, the user has the choice between black borders on both sides, while the impression of an iPhone 6 is awakened. When watching a video in 2: 1 format, one piece of video is cut away from one edge. Some say that you do not notice, I myself prefer watching videos in the iPhone 6 design. Maybe this will be eliminated in the next generations.3. CameraAfter the screen we come to the camera. This was improved here again. Now videos can be recorded in 4k at 60 frames per second. The photo quality also increased again. Here is shown again, the old Urlaubsknipser cameras have had their day. Like the iPhone 8 Plus (and 7 Plus), the iPhone X has a dual lens camera. Here, another focal length is used for the second lens. This gives you an optical zoom. This is handy in some situations. However, in my eyes, no Kaufgrund.Was rather for the dual lens camera speaks is the portrait mode. This is just a gimmick and according to Apple in the moment still a beta. This one notices when using too. Some pictures are super sharp and the effects are also very nice, others you notice bad Photoshop. The hair is cut off and here and there even area in the face are cut off. This will probably take some development on the part of Apple.Von the quality of the pictures you can not complain, only in the dark, the focus likes times. But that is not tragic.4. Face ID Let's get from the back camera to the front camera. This has also improved Apple. By eliminating the Home Button Apple waives the Touch ID sensor. The new technology is called Face ID.And this works amazingly well and exactly. The added value is already noticeable when setting up. While the finger on the Touch ID has to be put on several times to teach in 1 finger, Face ID requires only two turns of the head. The speed is felt faster than Face ID. A quick look is enough. Very often it happens to me that I just want to see the time and it is unlocked. I think the Face ID Touch ID will be 100% replaced. It is safe and can not be tricked by a simple photo. To the point that South Korean explorer Face ID tricked with a mask. In my eyes, this is just scary. You would have to take several pictures of the face and make the mask with a 3D printer. This takes time. With Touch ID, only one glass with the fingerprint is sufficient.5. Software Apple has its latest software bundled with the iPhone X. iOS 11 runs stable and brings many new features. In my opinion, the functions are just a normal development. The software is not as stable as it should be. With the iPhone X have felt a few new bugs occurred. So some apps on the iPhone X do not run on other devices without problems. Here Apple will probably still have to help by various updates. Feels like the hardware is too modern for the software.6. Performance / Battery Let's get on with the performance. The new iPhone (8, 8 Plus and X) has the new A11 processor. And this is currently the top model in the smartphone market. Several tests show this. This high performance can now be used for app developers to get the most out of their ideas. This power also needs Strom.Beim battery Apple has not improved much. With average use, I can easily create 2 days. There were already 3 days in it. In intensive use one day is easy to master. How it compares to other top models in the smartphone market, I can not say. Here others like to say how the iPhone beats in comparison.Innovations Let us now turn to other small innovations. With the new iPhones Apple has now installed a wireless shop. A practical innovation with the device just needs to be placed on a surface and is charged. Here you have to be very careful which cover you use. I had two in use so far. The first one has led to frequent crashes (1 night loading from 15% -> to 83%). The second case was not a problem. A very good technology that shows how innovative Apple is. This technique is also so new that other manufacturers have only been selling it since 2012. Apple will probably always go quite sure that it will be worthwhile. Due to the new technology, I use the attached Lightning cable currently no longer. Conclusion: Who decides to buy an iPhone X gets a very high quality device for a proud price of over 1000 €. Here the ghosts divorce if the price justifies itself. Allegedly the production costs an iPhone X approx. 300 €. In my opinion, the price is okay. For what you get at least. Whether some people are willing to pay this price is up to you. You get a really sophisticated smartphone for your money which is in all areas on the state 2017/2018. Performance / Screen / Camera / Face ID / Wireless Charging. Everything is now up to date after a few years and at the current time Apple can even outperform their competitors in all respects in the front games and in many areas. The iPhone 8 is a little further back here. With the iPhone X, Apple is ringing their new design line in the smartphones and how it will be in the future to be seen. I can give a buy recommendation, but everyone should go to an Apple Store and take the device in hand. Who has an iPhone 7 should wait in my eyes with the purchase. Anyone who has an iPhone 6s can dare the change without a guilty conscience. One look at Android vs iOS: Both systems are an eternal battle and never will be a winner. If one is an Android fan he will surely only find bugs while an Apple fan will surely find some bugs on Android. Everyone should make their own opinion on this topic. It is the iPhone X is a strong smartphone which has weaknesses and the same would synonymous with a Samsung / HTC, etc. write. In this recession, I deliberately did not compare with other devices because I did not use them. I just want to make it clear that comments on these points can stay away. This concludes my recession. If something changes in the next few months (long-term), I will supplement this here.
6914	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Thomas	5	A-MONTAIN simply top!	2018-03-26	de	Everything has already been said about the iPhone X. I love it myself, because it goes back in the handy direction, in terms of size. Apple from its coolest side :) Since the iPhone 5SE I order my cell phones without exception at A-Montain & has never been disappointed: Top shipping, original goods, original packaging .. Absolute Satisfaction Guarantee! Thank you very much for that :)
6915	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Max Quellbrunn	5	iPhone X as a successor to the iPhone 6s	2017-12-05	de	To make my review here really useful, I write from my special experience as a former iPhone 6s user who now uses the iPhone X. I go into the advantages that the X has compared to the 6s, in which areas you can see no difference or for what reasons a change is worthwhile or not worthwhile.Old model: iPhone 6s, 64 GBNew model: iPhone X, 64 GB ** Screen size or mobile size ** The iPhone X has a slightly larger screen. What strikes immediately is the larger font size. This is a bit uncomfortable at first, but lays relatively fast. When I took my iPhone 6s after a few days in the hand, the font and screen size seemed too small. Although the size was not a change reason, I would now also advise to change. ** Face ID vs.. Fingerprint ** Sure, it's cool that the iPhone X offers facial recognition. However, the changeover is still hard for me. I noticed that in the past I often had the iPhone 6s on the table, and could easily unlock with my fingerprint. Because of the Face ID, I have to pick up the iPhone X or bend over the phone so I can unlock it. That was much easier in the past. The Face ID works just as reliable as the fingerprint that I would wish for. Here was the iPhone 6s better or more pleasant. ** Speed ​​** I can make that short: The iPhone 6s was always super fast and I had no problems with it. Even after 3 years in continuous use, there was no reason to moan. There are no noticeable differences between 6s and X. ** Battery life ** Again, there is no big difference. Despite the larger screen, I have the feeling that I need to load the iPhone X a little less, so that the battery life is a bit longer. ** Camera or photos / videos ** One wonders with each change, whether the camera really can get even better. The photos and videos at 6s were really great. Nevertheless, I naturally hoped that the difference is noticeable or visible. This hope was fulfilled once again. The camera with all the known additional features is an absolute reason to switch. ** Memory ** I have chosen the 64GB version, since the 64GB iPhone 6s were absolutely sufficient. Despite a lot of photos, videos, games and other apps, including a gigantic Whatsapp database, I never got to the limit. That's why I chose the smaller version this time. I hope I will not regret this choice in 1-2 years, but so far I'm confident and happy to have saved a bit of money. ** CONCLUSION ** Switching from iPhone 6s to iPhone X makes sense. Nicer photos, a better and larger display, and some new features that may be better used in the future (such as facial recognition or the frameless screen). If you change, you should ask yourself when choosing the memory, whether in the past with 64GB more frequently became scarce or not. Thank you for reading and hopefully have fun with the iPhone X.
6916	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Nico	5	Full score for the 10s	2018-03-15	de	What should I write great? ... Smartphone as expected top! Super fast delivery, even before the given delivery date. Can you recommend without hesitation.
6917	iPhone X	64GB	Argent 	Rasmus Fuhse	4	A big smartphone for humanity?	2018-05-04	de	The critics will go on, no matter how good work Apple delivers. They say that the iPhone X is too expensive, the Notch would be annoying, the Smartphone would generally lag behind the competition only behind. To Apple products you have to know in general: you can never just in "" can do this and can "" measure up. In fact, Samsung's competitors have had OLED displays or rimless displays in their repertoire for many years. And yet, people only buy an iPhone X at a seemingly overpriced price and are therefore still very satisfied. How can that be? Computers, smartphones, tablets and probably every major technical object as well as cars today are much more than the sum of the individual parts. The parts also have to fit together. And Apple is exactly great in selling a coherent package of hardware and software. The customer unpacks it and is simply thrilled. Point! The fine line between "doing what it should" "and" "yeehaa!" "Is what has made Apple one of the most valuable companies. Since Steve Jobs' death, the Apple products are unfortunately really missing the last whistle. But they are still the same in their philosophy and can still inspire.So I unpack the iPhone X.- The display is the hit of this version! Anyone who has seen an OLED TV and an LCD TV next to one another in televisions simply knows that OLED is better around worlds. You never want to miss this black value anymore. Apple Phones have had pretty good black levels in the past as well, but they're not as good as an OLED display. Personally I thought after a few hours "" perhaps it hangs on the white values? "". My display seemed a bit yellowish somehow. Only subtle, then more and more clear. This was due to Apple's much advertised TrueTone. Apple tries to adapt the display colors to the ambient light. To be honest, I think the display is awesome since I deactivated TrueTone (Settings -> Display & Brightness -> TrueTone). For people who say they sleep worse at night, NightShift is still a special feature to make the screen color redder at night.You can also vary the strength of the coloring. But I have no problems with sleep. I would like to point out the round corners of the display separately. They are really round, you do not see a single pixel. The resulting black border flatters the display. It just looks beautiful. That's just a detail, but I think one often unconsciously pays attention to these little details. You do not perceive them, but they make a good product a very good one. The Notch! This is the wide indentation in the display at the top center. Many who know the iPhone X only from web pages and have never held in their hands, find the notch is a reason not to buy the iPhone. This is nonsense! The notch is almost never negative. Only it is stupid that in the upper right corner is no more room to display the connected BlueTooth devices (and their battery level). This is missing a bit and is indirectly due to the existence of the notch. But otherwise he does not notice. After only half an hour, that feels quite natural.- The camera: It should be the best camera ever installed in a smartphone. Some say that the pixel from Google has a better camera. I think that's all a matter of taste. The camera is good in any case. Her trick is that she takes a lot of pictures and tries to get the best information out of everyone. You can even change the date of the triggering something later. Never again closed eyes in the group photo! Because the iPhone X has two cameras (like the iPhone 7 plus or 8 plus), it can create a 3D profile in the background. It tries to use the 3D profile to defocus the depths in portrait mode. Unfortunately, this does not always work.Especially on sharp edges of a front object, you can see quite clearly that the edge is now and then out of focus. This then seems extremely unnatural. I'm not sure if this can be improved later by a software update or it needs new hardware. One thing is for me: If it works with the portrait mode, the picture is the hammer. If it does not work, you can delete it right away. Have a photo attached, where you can guess what makes this feature great, but where it has its weaknesses (small hair pieces of the dog are blurry, although they would actually be sharp, if the blur would not arise through software). - The size: I had an iPhone 5s before. Many have been angry that there was no iPhone X Plus (so in large). I was glad that Apple installed a large display in a small device, because handiness is important to me. Unfortunately, the iPhone X is still much larger than an iPhone 5 or an iPhone SE, which would have been better for me. If you built the iPhone smaller now, the notch would probably bother you even more. So I'm not reproaching Apple, but me, that I had not researched better before I ordered it. And I do not know if I would not have ordered it, even if I had known. This is simply the point where I am in fact the most dissatisfied with the iPhone X.- FaceID: In principle, FaceID works in my view (hihi, word game) excellent and fast. Even if I sit at the table and the iPhone is in the distance to my cereal bowl, it can still recognize my face. So you do not have to look exactly from the front. FaceID became necessary because you wanted to rationalize the home button. I can understand the decision well. Nevertheless, I think that the home button is missing a bit. I hope, I will get used to the operation even better in the next few weeks. But quite as easy as other iPhone X users describe it, I did not notice the change so far. You can do everything with the gestures. But how do I finish an app without calling an app? I still have to think about it too often. Again, these are the details that I talked about, that make a good one a very good product. I'm still not sure if I'm happy with it or dissatisfied. And all the rest? It is splash-proof. Excellent! I do not have to keep an eye on the rain clouds when jogging or cycling, but I can just keep going. Wireless charging is extremely important, considering that the headphone jack is eliminated. So you can listen to music and music at the same time. That's great, too. Everything you want to do with the iPhone works fast. Nothing jerks. The sound of the speakers has improved. But he is not good for my feeling. There is currently no smartphone, which has hi-fi speakers on board. That's the way it is. I just wanted to write what I noticed. Most of them only ever write "" great "" or make fun of Apple. The price is high, but the smartphone is great. I give a star deduction personally, because it is too broad for me and is not so good in the hand. Nevertheless, I will keep it and appreciate the next years very much. Update 1 - Have a photo attached. The photo looks great at first glance. But if you look closer, you realize that the dog has blurred fur on the edges, which should actually be sharp. These are just the limits of the software in portrait mode. In itself a great feature, but sometimes brings out unnatural results.
6918	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	DrMabuse	5	Great smartphone	2017-12-18	de	I have only been using iPhones for several years, most recently I had the 6S. I have always been very satisfied, updates come regularly and over several years, the operating system is very stable and the whole Apple universe very well thought out and coordinated. Of course you pay more than for an Android phone, but you have much more for your money mMn. Also, the iPhone X is a great device, I got it as part of a contract extension. I usually have at least 60% battery in the evening, despite massive Daddelns, I had that on any cell phone. The performance is great, Face ID works well despite initial concerns, even if Touch ID is sometimes cheaper, especially if the device is on the table. Reception is also good, which was sometimes not so optimal with earlier iPhones. And it has the perfect size for me, a large display with still handy dimensions. I do not regret anything here, only that I would like to operate the X without a shell, but I'm still too big a bowl ...
6919	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	Kunde	4	The best iPhone so far	2017-12-19	de	I switched from iPhone 6 to 10's. Actually, just because I wanted to have a slightly larger display, which I still can handle well one-handed. The Plus models have always been too sparse for me. Ok, if I were over 2m tall, that would work. But, I'm not. So I had to wait for the first almost frameless iPhone. And what can I say, I'm completely thrilled! Only the missing fingerprint sensor makes me in one or the other situation grief z.b at the cash register, in the car, at the desk. Therefore, only 4 Sterne.Ach yes the reception in the LTE band has improved a little, one or the other smaller LTE hole I have not anymore. In comparison with the 6s of course.
6920	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Katze21	5	The best smartphone. Point.	2017-11-30	de	Without a hint of doubt, the iPhone X is the very best phone I've ever owned. My personal highlights: FaceID works perfectly, the display is fantastic, the size perfect and the camera with optical zoom and image stabilization bombastic. But there are also many small details that make using it more fun. The quality of the workmanship is great, which makes the phone very easy to hold, the speakers are not great for the size they are taking, and the TapticEngine (the vibration motor) in combination with 3D Touch make you feel like real buttons also the battery is better than the previous generation, a day is synonymous with absolute continuous use no problem, at least I still charge it every night, which, thanks to wireless charging anyway no effort ist.Zum price is said: Yes, it is incredibly expensive. Just a few years ago nobody would have been willing to spend over € 1,000 on a cell phone. Many people probably still think so today. But some crazy people are actually willing, like me, to invest this money. And it was really worth it for me personally. I use my phone every day for several hours and I want to be confused with hanging apps, a bad camera and security problems caused by missing updates or face recognition that can be tricked by a photo. For that I also like to spend more money. If you also maintain the cell phone well and sell it in one or two years at a reasonable price, the effective cost eh "only" to one to a maximum of two euros per day. Since I prefer to drink a coffee less and buy me a reasonable phone.

6923	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	5	A dream of smartphone	2017-11-25	de	Have received the Iphone X today and am totally excited about the speed of the device! Had before the Iphone 6 and after the last updates of ios 11 you noticed a few jerks what annoys me personally just annoying. Touch ID was great, I would like that in the Iphone x but well of Face ID I'll get used to quickly, so far, it works great even in the dark! Camera is in contrast to the Iphone 6 a quantum leap, in low light conditions, it was still great pictures without too much to rush! I'm completely satisfied! You do not need to talk about the price, but the part will be up and running in 5 years' time, it has a lot of potential for things that are still in its infancy (AR etc). Do not trust the reviews from the people who still use the thing Never had in hand and blaspheme here, as it is in life, but everyone must know whether he spends so much money for a cell phone or not, there are other cell phones from other manufacturers cost around 1000 ¬ but just the Iphone you always have the feeling you have to justify yourself! A pity, well
6924	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Entrail	5	Super Smartphone	2017-11-13	de	Pro portait mode still very mixed (especially on the front camera) - Elimination of TouchID (where FaceID surprised me very positively) Short to me, I already had countless smartphones including the iPhone 4s, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, Samsung Note 2 , Nexus 6P, Galaxy S7 and an Asus Zenfone AR. Specifically, the standby times for the iPhone 6 Plus, but also the battery life in use have set standards for me, since I was never satisfied. The iPhone X has very similar battery life I have so far - I come to about 1 hour use per 10% battery loss. So about 10 hours in total. That's almost the value that my 6 Plus has done and of which I was really positively surprised. Unfortunately, the size of the Plus models was a bit too big for me. The 4.7 "" model, on the other hand, was always minimally too small for the outside dimensions, as well as the edge especially above and below the display, which I already have with the iPhone 3G criticized and which even pulls up to the iPhone 8 from 2017 through. So for me three clear reasons that speak for the iPhone X. It is still very handy similar to the 4.7 "" iPhones, but has a larger display and a battery life comparable to the Plus models, if not even minimal over it. **** Processing **** The mobile phone is Super processed what I expect for the price but definitely. But it also feels relatively difficult. It's about as heavy as my old 6 Plus according to the gram numbers, but probably feels harder because of the more compact design, because you just suspect less weight in size. But for me that is rather positive, as long as I know that the weight comes from high quality materials. **** Operation, FaceID, Homebutton (gesture) **** The omission of the Homebuttons was a big doubt for me before the purchase , I was still annoyed by TouchID in the iPhone 6 Plus because it was slow and often did not work, I've learned to love it since my iPhone 6S. It was fast and reliable. Since the home button on the iPhone X has been removed, now the possibility TouchID on the back or in the power button to bring under. However, Apple seems to be very sure FaceID and completely dispense with it. My concerns regarding FaceID were specifically how quickly does it recognize me, I have a much higher error rate than TouchID and it takes significantly longer to unlock the iPhone effectively, it works in absolute darkness? Now after 10 days I can say that FaceID surprised me more than positively. For one thing, you really need absolutely no light because the front camera is not used at all, only the infrared sensors, which do not need light. I've even covered the camera extra - absolutely no concerns. The error rate of FaceID is also quite low. I do not have any empirical data on that, but it feels that I have a hand on my face that is almost flawless and probably even better than TouchID. What caused me a headache in the run-up was to replace the simplicity of the Homebutton with a gesture. I think everyone knows how often it did not work to wipe up the control center from below. Now the Homebutton gesture works really much better and above all, really intuitive, since the first time wiping you got the hang of it. I often catch myself picking up the old iPhone, trying to swipe up there. All in all, I really like the implementation very well, especially with regard to the new design with the entire display front.There is simply no room for a homebutton and as it was implemented, it is really good, and space-saving. **** Camera / s **** First of all, the main camera. This makes really good pictures and captures in comparison to my 6s especially in the dark much more light. Otherwise the dynamics are really good. Here, however, the Pixel 2 seems to have the nose in front. What I do not like so much is the portrait mode. If it works, you get a nice picture, but in my eyes there are too many situations where either the background is not really pixelated. In addition, the edges are often still very dirty, so that the background or the object in the foreground on the contour is slightly pixelated. All in all, I'm very happy with the camera, but I would still want improvements in portrait mode. The front camera even makes very good pictures. With the iPhone X you can also shoot portrait photos with the front camera. The feature is currently still in beta and you can tell that very clearly. The face often looks like covered with a very strong blur and also the problem of the main camera on the contour often the background is not pixelated, or the object is pixelated in the foreground. The differences to the Google Pixel 2 are here really worlds. Also here I hope that Apple put a lot of work in. **** Conclusion **** I can understand anyone who says that the iPhone X is too expensive, because I personally regret that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus design technically got so little. The iPhone has been to iPhone 3G times as far as the edges are just too much and one of my major criticisms and even if they have minimized (I think) 5s minimally, it was always clear to me too much edge. The Apple now this year brings out an iPhone which feels really modern and then still presented two devices according to the old design is a bit unfavorable in my eyes and not what Apple once had as a philosophy - 1 device that is "perfect" , Well, they have not quite complied with the jump to the 4.7 "" and 5.5 ", because the big one had the better camera. Apart from that and the place larger battery, but they were almost the same. The X, however, is really another house number. A more expensive stainless steel frame compared to aluminum. Better display in terms of resolution and technology - even if the Notch is not necessarily perfect. A camera that is even better than the Plus model (both lenses have an image stabilizer on the plus model, only the 1x camera) and the front camera is better and supports FaceID. I've got it despite the price, since I've been for myself after the iPhone 4s on the Galaxy Note 2 changed a mobile phone in 5 "" format had wished, at the former display edges. Although the iPhone X has 5.8 "" absolutely, minus the Notch and because it is now a borderless display, it has pretty much the size that I think is optimal. In addition, the battery is very important to me and I was really satisfied with any android, even if I had devices that had a larger than average battery (Note 2 and Nexus 6P) .For me, the iPhone X is therefore a really successful smartphone with a really good , although still need to be improved camera for a proud price.
6925	iPhone X	64GB	Space Gray	A. Sanli	2	Absolutely disappointed	2018-01-13	de	I am really disappointed with my order. It has nothing directly to do with the iPhone itself, but with the experience around the order. First of all, the delivery took a full 5 days, although the delivery was made by Amazon itself and usually never takes longer than 2 days. But you can actually ignore that, can happen. Finally, the iPhone arrived and what I was absolutely surprised was that the contents of the package was not protected at all, either with bubble wrap or other "" shock-absorbing "" packaging materials. In view of the price of more than 1000 € it would be more than adequate to secure the goods properly. Especially in view of the fact that the package was even slightly damaged in one place. In my opinion, really not at all. Now we come to the phone itself ... I unpacked it, but let it out for safety because of the cold temperatures outside for 30 minutes lying around, so it warms up to room temperature and the battery is not is charged so heavily. When I wanted to turn the device on, it crashed after about a second. At first I assumed that the battery may be deep discharged. After an hour on the charger still nothing happened. I did a reboot and the iPhone actually went off. After about 30 seconds, however, it crashed again. I suspected a software bug and did a recovery on iTunes. After that, the iPhone finally went and I was able to set it up. After about 5 minutes, the iPhone crashed again and despite all efforts, I could not bring it back to work. All in all, I'm just disappointed. For a purchase price of over € 1000 you can probably ask for a working copy. Above all, I have now waited one week for free. Will not order it again because of this experience. Thanks for nothing. Still a few short notes on the phone itself (if that is possible with a broken device at all). The iPhone X has definitely felt super high quality. The size was great and it was just very good in the hand. As far as the "" exterior "" I was really excited. I also really liked the screen. Personally, for example, Notch did not bother me. The only thing that I found strange is the missing homebutton. You may get used to it, but I personally would not have gotten used to it. Otherwise, the iPhone X has actually not distinguished from its predecessors in the 5 minutes in which I could use it. Therefore, I also come to the conclusion that it is really not worth it, in my view, 300 € more to pay for the iPhone X. In the first few minutes you hold it in your hands you are totally thrilled, but then the euphoria flies relatively quickly and you doubt if it was really a wise decision. You drive with an iPhone 8 (plus) definitely just as good, but significantly cheaper Well, ultimately, everyone must decide for themselves. I was not convinced.
6926	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	4	Benjamin Jackel	2017-11-16	de	I'm more than excited. I, as a shrink-wrapped Samsung user, was really convinced by Apple and IOS. The camera is amazing, AR works really great and I am super surprised by Face ID. Did not think the Face ID works so well. The iPhone is super fast and flashed me everytime. The justification nevertheless not the price. If it had cost at least under 1000 € there would be 5 stars. Although 900 € is still too much for a cell phone: / But have a good contract. I am more than enthusiastic and everyone must know if he can live with the price :)
6927	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	egmbh	2	Nice device, but gestures do not convince	2017-11-03	de	At first, I think the facial recognition issue might be a problem, but it works surprisingly well. The screen is great, but pictures and videos look better on the old iPhone just because they have no dent. What I do not like at all are the new swipe gestures. Thus, the entire operation is now overloaded and error-prone. A button can sometimes be really useful, which already had to learn various car manufacturers who wanted to settle everything only on the iDrive.

When I turned off Face Id it got better, but my eyes continued to seep when reading websites. I entered "eyestrain with Iphone x" at Google and lo and behold: Many users have this problem due to an unobtrusive flickering of the OLED display. In addition, the attention check of the face-id camera ensures that the face is regularly scanned with UV rays. That can not be healthy! Since I own the Iphone 8Plus I have no more problems with it.

6934	iPhone X	256GB	Space Gray	HerrHeerHerr	2	Hach, the good iPhone X;)	2017-11-12	de	Who did not look forward to Apple's new innovation? When I heard about the iPhone X, I stole the order of my iPhone 9S and flew extra to the United States to be one of the first to buy and hold such a gem. I also only had 8 days to go to the Apple Store campen.Zwar I lost my job as Minister of Defense but that was worth it in the end. Because one of the new, innovative features, such as the FaceID, with which Apple has enriched the entire future, was for me the main reason for buying the iPhone X. I'm too lazy to just unlock my phone with my finger. Although you do the phone with your fingers but the sole unlocking me completely aus.Vllt Apple is so innovative and soon developed a new iPhone, which you can control completely only with the eyes, better by telekinesis or thoughts. Would be useful for People who have no hands. Another factor would be the well-known and innovative-bristling OLED display, which is literally soo "cool" that it is sensitive to cold. In order to test this I am even together with NASA and SpaceX traveled to the distant dwarf planet Pluto, where the temperatures are below -600C.- It came out that our spaceship and all supplies froze, the iPhone X, however, ran FAST perfectly. So it was already stable, but it would have at -5 more What to consider as a counterpoint, would be Apple's pricing policy: The phone is me (unemployed) that way too cheap.Denn alone this cool and äuße most useful animation, if you push the widget aside, is in my eyes a fortune of at least € 9999 worth.

Round display on the corners - nothing for gamers and video gobblers!	2017-11-03	de	My colleague is Applefan and has gotten the great IPhoneX. I had the model up to version 5S and then I had to let it stay. Now for the test of the Iphone X: It makes a solid impression, but I have to say the homebutton Apple fans very much miss. Why? Because the facial recognition is very bad. I have to hold the phone as high as if I were using a women's mirror! When driving, that probably everyone sees and the police can equal to the luxury owners at the price once again give a hefty penalty. Have fun with Apple Enthusiasten.Naja, I'm a little disappointed. The camera is once again set to the outside and that has once again very much supported me, even with the model Iphone 6 I was a thorn in the eye and that's why I had used only to Iphone 5, the prestige device. People design looks different. Here would have let me run from the times Karl Lagefeld as a designer should.Was I have probably bought? I stick with Huawei P10 and have to say that here the design for the Apple is much nicer and the camera is not so unprofessional outward. In addition I have to say that the Huawei has installed a GERMAN CAMERA OF LEICA -WAU-- the pictures are as sharp and detail rich as if you were live. OK Apple tries to follow the German with the China or Japan lens. However, from my point of view, this is far too expensive and not justified for the device. Just compare the Huawei device and you'll be amazed why the device is in no way inferior in quality and quality. Even the display was better before than Apple. Now Apple has even installed Samsung as a display technology and even demands more than Samsung! This is sad. Of course you can pay 80% more for the pure name in the name of Apple, but that is over soon, as with the premium car manufacturers or in the shopping markets. :-) So do not make such a hype about a smartphone that will soon cost more than a high-end gaming PC!

The 30 € to save compared to the store price, it was not worth it. Note: For returns on Amazon over 500 ¬ you have to make a sworn statement so you get the credit. That's what hooked me, only after submitting the affidavit I got my money back.

At full volume on the smartphone you just heard something (quietly) of music / video / call. When background noise (city / sports center) you heard even less of what is being played (Spotify, Youtube, iMusic, etc.). Tried different headphones, even other people (friends / family / friends) to try. Could have been that I am suffering from a hearing (acute) fall. I do not have this problem with my iPhone 5s.

Very good commissioning went off, just capture a whirling circle with the camera of the Althandys and already starts the setup of the new phone completely automatically and wirelessly. The prerequisite is, of course, that the old device has a backup in the iCloud. In between, enter the code and the Apple ID a few times. After an hour, everything is done, the latest IOS version is installed and the old phone completely cloned. The delivered Iphone 8 arrived intact as a new product with me. The bigger, but not too big screen, I like, as well as the larger storage space with 64 GB. That should be sufficient for me now. Otherwise, the smartphone works smoothly and quickly. I am happy.

The cellphone takes outstanding photos. Unfortunately, no portrait functions of the sister model iPhone X. Battery lasts at least the whole day. Display also at a high level.

7077	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Marcus Binder	5	Am satisfied	2018-08-21	de	A preliminary - Actually, the iphone 8 is an iphone 7s. Compared to its predecessor falls in the EVERYDAY: Slightly faster performance The photos made by the phone are a little warmer (the colors do not look as pale as the 7). It is noticeably heavier than that iphone 7 - which is for me a disadvantage. In my opinion, it is better Processed than its predecessor (buttons can be more pleasant press etc. = general better feel) The speakers are louder and have a richer sound (very good for a cell phone). Battery: if the phone is not in continuous use (sometimes checking whats app, taking a few pictures, surfing the internet, instagramm ...) the battery is enough for 1 day. I have to go to bed most of the time about 30% battery capacity left. However, I have to say that I use the phone neither to play nor to excessive video consumption. Tip from me: if you already own an iphone 7, the benefits of an iphone 8 are too low d However, if you would like to upgrade from an older model (iphone 6s / SE or older) to a new one, I would recommend buying an iphone 8 directly because the price difference compared to the 7 is not serious. What the seller (A-Mountain): I have checked the serial number on the apple homepage and it is indeed a new device with full warranty. So everything is fine! Unfortunately, I can not answer you as the cheaper price comes. But probably everyone will care as long as the product itself is okay (with full apple warranty + new). I hope I could help you with your purchase decision something.
7078	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Happy	5	iphone 8	2018-08-08	de	super quality of the iphone 8, battery lasts 2 days approx is super with pocket in drr hand, I can only recommend!
7079	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Janick vdS	5	My first Iphone - I am satisfied!	2018-08-30	de	Hi, I also decided to buy an Apple product. How that came, I can not say. In any case here my review to the Iphone came with Prime quickly and easily. Packed in the Amazon package, everything looked normal and commercially - it was. Included in the box is the Iphone, charging cable, power adapter, headphones, AUX adapters and descriptions in all languages. Functionality: I think to Apple products I need not tell anything here. Everything runs super fluently, thanks to IOS 11. The camera on the phone is amazing and the fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. Overall, it was personally unusual for me to hold an IOS device in my hand, because I had been running Android devices. In a direct comparison, the Iphone seems to run smoother compared to my previous devices. The battery life is unfortunately not that convincing. Conclusion Apple products are really great, work flawlessly, have great specifications and details. Unfortunately, the brand can pay well. Nevertheless, a really good smartphone!
7080	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	iPhone 8	5	iPhone 8 - Quality and Design in Perfection	2018-05-01	de	I ordered the iPhone 8, because my iPhone SE was a little too small. With AMAZON PRIME as usual delivered in next to no time the next day. Packed, furnished and look forward to a smartphone, which shines with extraordinary quality and design. About the design can be a lot of discussion, since it is known from the iPhone 6 from the year 2014. However, for anyone who does not want to give up the home button including the very fast Touch ID, the iPhone 8/8 Plus is the perfect solution. Also, you do not have to do without performance here, because the iPhone 8/8 Plus is currently, next to the iPhone X, the most powerful smartphone, which is currently available. Videos in 4K (60fps) are with this smartphone, the absolute insanity. Very smooth playback and true color images are easily possible with the Apple phone. Processing is Apple-typical on a level, which is unparalleled sucht.Und Amazon.de can only say: TOP price! 699 € for the iPhone 8 are unbeatable at the current time. From a reputable provider to get such a price, absolutely great. Next so dear Amazon team -------------------- Experience report after three weeks of use: The iPhone 8 is very much Liquid with iOS 11.Bislang no grounds for complaint with my device. Everything works perfectly. The battery life was initially a bit short, but has made after several charges an improvement in battery life noticeable. I come with the relatively "small" battery easily through a full day with normal use (WhatsApp, Facebook, e-mail, Internet). But if you expect an excessively long battery life, I would be better served with the iPhone 8 Plus. A11 Bionic - That's the built-in processor of the iPhone 8th Games run without jerking and require the A11 chip only a fraction of the possible ab.Der Virtual Homebutton was unusual in the beginning, as I have previously used the iPhone SE with conventional Homebutton. After the three-week use, but I can say now, you miss nothing. On the contrary, a pushable home button does not look contemporary anymore. The interaction of the Taptic engine with the homebutton conveys a very high-quality click feeling which emphasizes the quality again positively. Camera - The camera is definitely one of the best that one can have in a smartphone. Razor-sharp images are no problem thanks to the optical image stabilization. The color-true videos are a clear advantage of the iPhone 8. Processing - Nothing creaks, everything perfect! The glass back looks very noble and gives the iPhone more grip compared to the aluminum housing of the iPhone 7 or iPhone SE. It is safe in the hand without having to fear that it will slide out of your hand at any moment. Since I myself use a sleeve of SPIGEN to optimally protect my iPhone, the grip is even better. Contra: The glass back is very vulnerable for fingerprints! Conclusion: Successful smartphone from the House of Apple, which despite the already known since the iPhone 6 (2014) design is not really recognizable at first glance. The Apple specifically developed iOS runs perfectly. All in all you get a high-end smartphone in a proven design with excellent quality in software, processing and Materialauswahl.Preis / performance is justified, since you get at least 4 years and longer Apple full support in the form of software updates
7081	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	John Doe	5	No German model - and on?	2018-06-27	de	I write this review because here again and again people are upset that the product comes with foreign packaging or papers. I myself have ordered from the vendor A-Montain an iPhone and actually received a Slovak model. I then had the IMEI checked at Apple and it was a completely new device. I signed it in and my warranty is one year according to Apple. I just want to say that all iPhone models are produced in China and therefore do not differ in quality. However, since the price varies from country to country, it is not surprising that if you want a cheap iPhone would like this from a non-German speaking country. I'm quite happy with the device. I've been using an iPhone 5s for over four and a half years now, and since it had some signs of aging, it was time to switch. I can only recommend the iPhone8.
7082	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	1	fire tv stick instead of iPhone 8 received !!	2018-10-17	de	I bought the iPhone to get it as uncomplicated as possible. However, just delay in delivery (was shipped from France) and then no device, but a fire tv stick from Amazon in the package! On the packaging is also another shipping sticker with Italian name .. just a corrosive extra effort! Now I get back the money after returning, but since this is an external seller, not automatically a new device.
7083	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	1	No original packaging!	2018-05-16	de	The price has lured, but the cell phone is not convinced: neither headphones were there, nor was it in its original packaging. The packaging itself contained "Demo - not for resale". On demand as this came about, I was just put off and only on the missing headphones. Apple & Amazon were informed. Please take care!

7086	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Amazon Kunde	5	TOP	2018-08-16	de	Was skeptical at first because of a few reviews and then I also thought about canceling the order. BUT everything was fine!

7088	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	batmom	5	thumbs up	2018-09-01	de	The iPhone was new and welded. Works flawlessly. Got this online for a very reasonable price. Offline, I would have had to pay about 250 euros. The only drawback - the delivery postman just put the phone down in the stairwell. That is not how it works. Not with such an expensive product.
7089	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Amazon Kunde	5	Order is recommended without hesitation	2018-08-11	de	Also I was very skeptical because of the enormously cheaper price, but the mostly very positive reviews encouraged me to buy. Rightly! The product is a flawless and brand new iPhone 8 64GB in the color gold. The shipment was from Spain and the product was completely original packed. All protective films were still attached and all included products (Lightning cable, plug, headphones, manual) were included. Also, the IMEI review revealed that it is a new and original iPhone. Unfortunately, I am not the greatest technology guru, I prefer not to lose the technical data. Since other reviews have very aptly put it in a nutshell anyway. I'm overjoyed to have come across this offer!

Everything is great, can only recommend this way - get great product, quite a bit of what saved, I would do it again
7091	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	MAX	5	Good quality	2018-05-03	de	The Iphone 8 is very good in the hand and visually looks very good. Through the glass back it is much more comfortable in the hand than, for example, the iphone 6. Technically, I could now recognize no serious differences to the Iphone 6. The only "" problem "" is still the camera with the Iphones - there are other manufacturers, some light years ahead of the quality of the pictures.
7092	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Amazon Kunde	5	Top, absolutely flawless!	2018-06-25	de	I was very skeptical at first, but I dared to buy it and am now very happy to have chosen this 'used' product. There was absolutely nothing wrong with that. "" Like new "" was definitely not over the top!

We are very satisfied and can only recommend it.
7096	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Jessica L	1	No words...	2019-03-03	de	I was a neutral mobile phone user from the beginning, I did not care if I would ever use IOS or Android. One day I thought that I could buy a smartphone from Apple for a change. This choice I regretted quickly, just to understand I was previously neither totally excited by one of the other ..... Super part of this part can tell me when I have to move, can me with one or the other hardware from Apple my pulse Announcements, can pay with it & in two years it will probably breathe and revive people. It puts every value on other things, but that Apple sells smartphones for this price, which does not even trivialities (transfer pictures, download one or the other) without the 30 tutorials and 12 apps must load is worthless in my opinion! I am disappointed that this mega-group is going to lift such a hype for something that is not worth a penny more than any other mobile phone! Nice that this thing can play so much future music, but fails with the simplest things! Hopefully some will understand and continue to pump so much money into this brand before not even trying anything else, which is a lot better for less money ...

7100	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Patrick Kaufmann	5	Last great iPhone	2019-01-22	de	Have the iPhone 8 with 64GB to my contract extension and not bought from Amazon. Am with the iPhone (very satisfied and that for about 14 months). The smartphone looks really great, because you do not want to make a protective cover, but unfortunately you have to use the mobile phones nowadays. The screens are getting rounder and very many manufacturers have the screen glass, unfortunately, small curves on the edges, which makes the screen very unstable. This forces an almost to the manufacturer's own insurance, which are not cheap or you get such a glass break insurance, who wants to play it safe. My IPhone 8 has fallen down once and the screen is broken despite the seal, sleeve and screen protector. Called the Apple service immediately and the phone was picked up the next day and it was repaired 3 days later. Do you have to say great and fast service and I already knew how expensive the repair is, that is not the case with other manufacturers. The screen brightness and sharpness is very good, a very clear picture. Fortunately, they have increased memory, which is also necessary because the operating system is already quite large. The hardware is great on the operating system tuned that you have to leave Apple. This keeps the battery very long. Even if I play a lot of videos and games or do something else during the day, the battery lasts all day. The camera is very good for me, there are many little gimmicks, I like it. The picture stabilizes very fast and the pictures are really great. Speakers are alright, I think a cell phone with super speakers does not exist, but the devices are too small and I need not synonymous. I like the iPhone 8 very well and I would buy it again and again. To the newer IPhones I can not say so much, only that the screens should be very unstable. I hope you have helped this review.

7109	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Kolibri	4	Very satisfied with service, only point deduction for photos by the sea.	2019-01-24	de	I've always had iPhones. Because I just love the operation. For the predecessor 7ner, there is not much difference. The only thing I always find something silly with Apple with the guarantee, or even iTunes is a bit inflexible. Not even pc tuned and photos or music without iTunes on it playing. About camera: my husband owns a samsung s8, on vacation by the sea I have to confess unfortunately ... it makes much nicer photos! The sea was super mega turquoise blue in Really, Caribbean and really great, the sky is beautiful blue and the sand is very fine and bright. While my iPhone 8 unfortunately made the sand a lot more yellowish and the sea unspectacular dark turquoise ... the sky just blue but not very like it was .... the Samsung made beautiful Caribbean shots. As it was on site, this amazing turquoise tone of beautiful bright sand, bright blue sky, everything was captured in a great way. I also tried other modes. Radiant and not all, but it wasn'tnicer.So photos on the sea with breathtaking turquoise tones rather with a great camera, which we also had it or a Samsung .... (which unfortunately I have to admit) machen.Es falls really already in the overview on what was done with the iPhone and what with Samsung ... If the operation of Samsung was not so stupid, I would actually consider .. But on iPhone operation Samsung does not ran. For the not so great sea photos a star deduction.

7113	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Der Schreiberling	4	Suitable for the user.	2019-06-08	de	I prefer to buy such devices always in the market. So Media Markt or Expert, Saturn. Apple has so many counterfeiters and products that do not quite work. So what their smartphone is concerned. As far as mine is concerned, I opted for the Apple Iphone 8 because the rest is not really better. Glass, metal ramen, etc. That's it. IoS 12 via update and matching glass case. Very stylish and good. Powerful and no crashes. Mainly I still use the Samsum S9. I will stay that way. It stands the permanent daily use well. The Iphone is equal to that. Basically, I use to work. Whether exaggerated or understated, to telephone, store company data, editing files, etc. It is well done. Bluetooth, pairing, uncoupling, connections with headphones, no problem. And with the pencil it is even better. I can recommend it to work. For general use too. Less for gambling. That's where I stay with the samsum S9. As with other phones, this is the top brand and price. The phone will continue to use but personally only for the gentle use. Glass can get cracked quickly. Nevertheless, it is thicker by the phone thicker than the phones from Samsum. Does not feel like a stone in your pocket. Still too thick for the Gürtelhandytaschen.Googel I made it. Play store as well. Siri stays.I can recommend it

7121	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	jeffrey Chan Schmidt	4	Everything that belongs to a good smartphone!	2018-09-18	de	I got it as a contract with Vodafone for 9.90Euro. I have to say from the iPhone 6s to the iPhone 8 this is a big change. The A11 Bionic processor has a processing power of something else. It's faster than any current Samsung flagship. The camera is good, but one thing is that unlike the iPhone 6s it snaps slower and sometimes looks rather blurry. With the iPhone 6s you can go and the pictures stay sharp. On the iPhone 8 I just go and the pictures are blurred. Is this due to the software? I would like to see iOS 12 still a fix update so that the camera properly stabilized and no longer blurred. I got a wireless port today for 19.99euro at Saturn to charge it wirelessly it works. The brand is SYCELL you can also order. I can recommend it further and hope that I could help you further. Best regards, Jeffrey SchmidtPs. I use the gold model with 64GB.
7122	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	5	Everything in perfect order	2018-05-21	de	The product has been delivered to your home in its original packaging, but the seller has not responded to my request to send the product as soon as possible. 1 week has taken the delivery. I did not check the serial number but somewhere I saw a label that was in a foreign language (Italian or Romanian?), Which does not bother me. The warranty I have checked and the warranty began to run only with the activation. Since the price was cheaper than in retail, I am satisfied, all Apple products are the same, no matter from which country you purchase them.
7123	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	bieniead	3	Split impression	2018-06-27	de	The positives: I think the iPhone 8 is handy, very well made, fast and reliable. The shipping through Amazon was within two days and it was a new, original boxed device that was not previously registered. The disappointment: I was convinced that Apple always installed high-quality cameras. Against this background, I also decided to buy this and hoped to be able to take better pictures with my mobile phone in the future. Unfortunately, the camera of the iPhone 8 proved to be worse than the Oneplus 3T, which is why I sent the phone back. The transaction: The seller A-MONTAIN, for the Amazon sent the phone has turned out to be absolutely serious and my next phone , which will hopefully have a better camera, I will gladly order there again. The shipping as the return was unkopliziert and schnell.Thade that the camera the iPhone so disappointed me. I regretted having to send the phone back.
7124	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	C.	5	Very Satisfied - Original iPhone - good price	2018-05-30	de	At first, I was skeptical that the iPhone is really original Apple. Yes, that's it! I have checked the imei number at Apple and it has not yet been activated. Furthermore, it was still sealed in the plastic film and everything was included with accessories. My iPhone was shipped from Spain. (White / silver) where apparently every color is shipped from another country, that is another dealer. The product name with zd / a has also agreed. An iPhone that was apparently intended for the German market. Fast delivery and value for money also fits. I can only recommend if you want to have an iPhone 8.
7125	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	FD	4	Top Smartphone	2018-05-27	de	The product was bought only after a decent price decline in March 2018, before it was simply too expensive in comparison to the rest of the smartphone market. From the outside: The iPhone is typically processed super appletypically and feels like a one-stop shop, you just like it on. The buttons are tight and press well. The look is not quite as of 2018, because the iPhone 8 has felt the same look as the iPhone 6 from 2014.Display: The display is sufficiently sharp, if you do not consume too much Full HD content. The brightness is good even in sunshine. Speakers: The stereo speakers are sufficiently loud and deliver a good sound quality. From the lower speaker come more volume and woofer than the earpiece speaker. Inside: The coordination between hardware and software is simply great at Apple, however, it has this year with iOS 11 needed a few updates until large bugs were fixed. Today in May 2018, everything runs crisply at a very high operating speed. Even with graphically demanding games, everything runs smoothly and the iPhone back is just a little warmer. As of today, the iPhone 8 has enough hardware power for many more years. The battery will last for up to 8 hours (display on in-room environments) for main browser use (60%) and games (40%), if the remaining "power guzzlers" are kept to a minimum. The camera also makes a good impression so far. Who wants better photos / videos, has to fall back on the iPhone X or the Huawei P20 pro. Price / Performance: Here there is deduction, since the optics are no longer stand 2018 and smartphones in the Android warehouse with comparable performance data more than 100 ¬ less costs.
7126	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Marcel Sowa	1	Scam!!! No NEW iPhone 8	2018-06-25	de	I was lured by the price ... unfortunately that was a mistake! The A-Montain vendor did not send an iPhone 8 for the German market as in the description, but an iPhone for the Czech market. See pictures. Unfortunately, when the call came out at Apple that this iPhone was already logged in and therefore no new product! This is a clear case of fraud for me! Amazon has already received notification and forwards it to the appropriate instance. So people, keep away from such offers, so you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.
7127	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Philipp Rill	1	Scam	2018-07-01	de	Unfortunately, even with this device a wrong barcode, cheap glued over. Instead a model for the German market, I have a receipt for the Czech. Since I did not get what was offered here, there is only one star for fraud.
7128	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	RaiYuu	4	Good phone, but ...	2019-05-21	de	Have the iPhone for 1 year now. The size is really suitable. However, the battery is already at 91% Max. Capacity, which I find a little bit. When making a purchase decision should be noted that the design is no longer up to date and the apps s.die new size of the iPhone X is adjusted. As for the performance and the camera, I'm still totally baff. Since Apple is really not rags
7129	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Claudi_ts	5	Something that takes a long time..	2018-10-15	de	At first I had no idea which rating I should write here .. but again from the beginning .. In September I ordered my IPhone 8, 64GB in gold, after I read all the great reviews. Also important were the delivery times. Everything was shipped with UPS. Initial difficulties on the part of UPS, I still took in the hope to soon hold my IPhone in the hands. UPS let celebrate and on a Monday my package should be delivered. Since I was not home, the re-delivery should be one day later. I immediately called the toll-free hotline and wanted to make an appointment. 2 pm I'm still working. UPS informed me that there is a kiosk nearby where I could pick up my package. Great, I thought and am on the following day immediately after work: closed. The kiosk was open all week even though the opening times said something different. Through the windows I could see my package lying on the ground .. the iPhone so close and yet so far, I called again against charges at UPS. These could not help with. Finally, I was able to establish contact with Amazon and the dealer Eutronics_Germania. Through many phone calls and a really hard-working boss I did not feel left alone. Nevertheless, in the end, I had to go to the police to file an embezzlement complaint so I could get a new IPhone. UPS informed me meanwhile that I should pick up the package in the shop. Hours: closed all day. Such Witzbolde.Am end, everything went well: via DHL, my IPhone arrived within a short time and I could test it now for a week. Overall, I think it's very good. The quality of Apple is great and the service is impeccable. And since I already had an old IPhone SE, the synchronization worked without problems and I was able to telephone, write and research in the usual way. Overall I am very satisfied with the iPhone so far and the customer service of Eutronics_Germania is top. For UPS I would like to give a different rating. That would be beyond the scope here.
7130	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Johann S.	5	Top cell phone	2018-03-08	de	We bought a mobile phone from TBE and are very satisfied with the iPhone 8 and the ordering process. Everything in perfect order.
7131	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Amazon Kunde	5	Top Smartphone	2019-01-28	de	After 2 years of Android, I returned to the tried and tested Apple camp. The iPhone 8 is a top smartphone, both visually and functionally. I have not regretted it for a minute, and android is far from iOS in my opinion. (Speed, stability, safety) That justifies the surcharge for me. Especially since I get again 4-5 years updates.
7132	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	ani	1	Part u. Serial number does not even know Apple.	2018-07-23	de	What can I say that is positive, it actually came an iPhone 8 as ordered. BUT: not intended for the German market as so often (in product description and in response to customer questions) promised by the seller. To camouflage that was "sent "Placed a sticker, I called as a precaution Apple and not even knew the codes on the back. Was then too delicate and I got the phone (still original packaging, therefore no idea if it works or not) sent back. Borderline in my opinion to fraud, especially because here the identity is deliberately veiled and advertised with "mobile phones for the German market." Funny Funfact: I have waited comparatively long for the refund and therefore called Amazon. If you return a higher-quality article - even though it has arrived completely - you have to sign an affidavit first. For every nonsense you get an e-mail. I would be informed about this on demand. Which, of course, the seller now can not do anything, this point affects only Amazon itself.

7137	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Fam. HappyDay	5	iPhone 8 64GB - Test / Comparison / Tips	2017-10-03	de	I personally bought the iPhone8 Space Gray. As a small savings joke I have had my iPhone 5 for 5 years so that means it was time to upgrade :-) Through my job I had and still have contact with younger iPhones and also to many different Samsung smartphones, where I for various company-specific facilities and bug fixes are in charge .------------------------------------------ --------------- Here is my personal review of the iPhone 8 64GB space grayI will always put down small tips / tricks at the bottom, which may be helpful for some. -------------------------------------------------- ------ DIMENSIONS / DESIGN ----- The iPhone 8 has the dimensions H: 138.4 W: 67.3 D: 7.3 mm and is 148g heavy. The size is thus minimal different than the iPhone 7, which is not recognizable. It fit case and protective glasses from its predecessor. For me, the size was the reason to buy. With too big smartphones, I can not do anything and the iPhone 8 is here at my upper limit. Ideal would have been natural if Apple also here (almost) borderless display installs. But what is not can still be in the next few years. Compared to the predecessor, the Iphone 7 was hardly changed here. The back is made of glass looks really classy. Unfortunately, this does not use anything, since a case is used anyway. Otherwise, the pages are still rounded off so the phone is very comfortable in the hand. The camera on the back stands out slightly. This is definitely an important disadvantage for those who want to use the device without a case. It suits me, however. The colors are a matter of taste, but for me only space gray came into question. Looks incredibly noble and I like it very well .----- DISPLAY ----- The display is 4.7 "" and has a resolution of 750 x 1,334 pixels. Thus, the pixel density at 326ppi and a lot less than the PLUS model and also smaller than most competitors. Nevertheless, the picture is extremely sharp and the worse value is not recognizable even for me. In direct comparison with the Samsung Galaxy S8, I only realize that the Galaxy S8 is much stronger colors. This looks better, of course, but the iPhone 8 display looks more natural.----- PROCESSOR / SPEED ----- That's the absolute strength of the iPhone. Here one is ahead of the competition for a long time. That's why I was able to use my old iPhone 5 for a full 5 years without restriction. The iPhone 8 uses the new A11 Bionic chip and it is sensational. There are no waiting times :-) In my comparison to the Galaxy S8, the difference is clearly visible. Opening apps and editing photos is ultra-fast, so Apple is one step ahead. The IOS 11 operating system, as always, is ultra-fast and easy to use. The great thing is that everything comes from one provider and is 100% compatible. - CAMERA ----- The camera has a resolution of 12.2 megapixels. That's enough for pretty much all users anyway, everything about it would be nonsense. Not much has changed compared to the predecessor, the photosensor is bigger and due to the fast chip movement and so on should be easier to handle. These are such small details. I think the cam was already first cream and it is now again. With previous use, I was completely thrilled by the photos. The great change, however, there is the video quality. 4K with 60 frames per second. Awesome :-) The slow motion videos as synonymous with HD quality. I have already done both outdoors and in bad light photos and I'm thrilled :-) The front camera is with 8.3 megapixels quite solid. Here you can see the quality difference to the rear but clearly. Nevertheless, a great front camera ----- BATTERY ----- About the battery, I can write something difficult so far. Depending on usage, the battery life varies greatly. Of course you will never get by a full day at full operation, for me the duration is satisfactory. Okay, now Apple has finally managed that their devices can also be wirelessly loaded by QI standard. This works great, and is eg.very comfortable with me in the workplace .----- COMPARED TO SAMSUNG GALAXY S8 ----- My brother has recently launched the Samsung Galaxy S8. I'm equally excited about its device and wanted to test / compare some things. First I have to say that the Galaxy S8 is larger. And especially at the height. The Galaxy S8 is longer than 1 cm. Otherwise, they are close to the same size. The S8 has much more display relative to the case. (4.7 "" to 5.8 ""). Visually, videos look better on the Galaxy. Stronger colors, shinier, looks awfully great, but maybe they're more genuine and natural on the iPhone. The speed is just as great, yet iPhone 8 is the clear No.1. Samsung has to work with Android, which has many cool features but does not make it perfect. Both are wirelessly rechargeable with QI technology. Camera wise, the two do not take much. Likewise with bad Lichverhältnisse. I like both. With the expandability / connectivity the Samsung is clearly in the advantage. The Galaxy S8 you can use a memory card - the iPhone is not yet what annoys me personally very annoying. The transfer of music, pictures, etc. is also very easy with the Samsung.Weiter speaks also of course the price for Samsung.PRO iPhone 8- extremely fast- hardware and software from a single source, perfect interaction- handy- Siri unbeatablePRO Galaxy S8- large Display / housing ratio extreme display brightness memory expandability good connectivity with other systems ----- CONCLUSION ----- I'm absolutely thrilled with the iPhone 8 and I'm glad to have spent the 799 ¬. But it should also hold like my old again a few years :-) An upgrade from the iPhone 7 on the iPhone 8 I think rather not necessary. The changes are not so big, there would probably be a switch to the iPhone X to consider.I can recommend the iPhone 8 to 100%. Except for a few nasty little things that have always been with Apple is a sensational smartphone. I've recently read a pro test, which has come out that it's the best smartphone yet, but at the same time the most boring: -) ----- TIPS ----- PRICEI would have preferred to buy here, but it was not available. It may take a bit longer to get there. So I bought it directly from Apple. In any case, the iPhone 8 64GB may not be more expensive than € 799, which is the list price and you get it normally everywhere. Everything that looks very cheap here I would do some research and investigate the dealer. Apple has its own pricing policy and would like to offer everyone the same price. Therefore, caution should always be exercised at special prices.3D TouchGibts has been around Apple for some time, but some new users may not know it. Example: A normal click on the app icon will get you into this app. Through a 3D touch (strong click) on the camera icon to get to the quick access of various actions of this app. Just try it :-) BLUETOOTH / WLANWer battery saving would like to be said, switching off Bluetooth or WLAN in the control center means only a temporary interrupt. It is completely deactivated only in the settings.CONTROL CENTERWith a wipe from the lower edge to the top you get as usual in the control center. This can finally be adjusted in the Settings / Control Center FINALLY. PHOTO SEARCH really cool and I like it very much. After opening the app photos there is indeed the search function. Here I just enter the keyword of the photo such as. Water or sport. IOS recognizes the pictures partially and assigns them keywords :-) Works quite well.SIRIViele my friends know you but use but hardly anyone. That's a matter of habit. But Siri just works great. Sometimes I do not need to pick up the iPhone to make calls, write messages or make various searches.
7138	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	SuzieQ	2	Supplied by A-Mountain: Vodafone (!) IPhone 8 with deviating item no. !!!	2018-07-06	de	Offered and ordered was a vendor neutral (!) IPhone MQ6H2ZD / A 8 64 GB silver. After a delivery time of 2 days, I received the device with unofficial glued serial or article numbers. Conspicuous was the conformity guarantee of the company Vodafone (!) In Italian. It may indeed be that the devices for the different EU countries do not differ technically, but no one guarantees me that on the device not pre-installed Vodafone software or apps that you either do not want or may not get off the device. Therefore, I do not necessarily agree with a pre-review on the safety of deviating article numbers.

The item is therefore zurück.Verpackung and delivery time flawless.

Neither the packaging nor the description, which I think is a pity. I had the IMEI checked, because they read here that they were not new phones. That's not true, it is in original packaging and previously not yet logged in. With the iPhone, I'm satisfied, all the best, only the battery does not last as long as expected. I can not say more. Because of the 2 points mentioned, there are only 3 stars :-)

7151	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Amazon Kunde	5	Nobody wants it	2017-10-24	de	but it was acquired as an update to 6s. The device can be seen as a logical continuation of a product line ... Lack of innovation? By no means, rather, continuity and understatement. Against the X has spoken for me missing Touch ID. I do not want a Face ID at the moment because I want to unlock the phone at any time without contact to the face. The processor is the same as in the X and in contrast to the 6s, Siri responds, for example. extremely fast, the rest was synonymous with 6s liquid. The camera is absolutely perfect and make even low light extremely good pictures, at least for my claims absolutely sufficient. Language quality has definitely got better and the stereo sound can be seen and are perfect update to the 6th. The device is "" waterproof "" ... nice addition ... There is no real innovation in any device, if you look at gadgets like borderless displays, as an innovation ... especially if a device falls. I would definitely buy the device again !

Since my old cell phone is broken, I did not take the time to send it back and reorder it!
7155	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Sarah Husslein	5	At first unsettled but now enthusiastic!	2018-02-21	de	I was a little confused at the beginning, since the iPhone was sold here much cheaper (675 €), as for example in the media market (799 €). But it is undoubtedly an original iPhone from Apple.Apple itself offers for the phone 1 year manufacturer's warranty. The IMEI can be found on the SIM card of the phone, if you enter this on the side of Apple, you get the confirmation that it is an original iPhone. Therefore there is no reason to worry:) The delivery went quickly and without defects. Included in the package were headphones (not the Bluetooth headset), an adapter to connect the headphones on the phone and a charging cable. The back of the IPhone (in gold) is not real gold, but rather a rose gold, which I personally like even better technical details to the iPhone I write now nothing, because you can google this easy:) Conclusion: Super great mobile phone, fast problem-free delivery, original goods (!!), no need to worry.

7157	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Bowman	5	Simply veieeel better than the 6s and viiieeel cheaper than the X.	2017-12-29	de	I have replaced my good 2 year old 6s with it and am thrilled. I needed it but bought quasi new / unused for 650 euros here on Amazon and must say: Super fast and with much better battery performance than the 6s. So you can also calmly with 25% charge again go to the fresh (cold) air to run for an hour with GPS App while listening to music (AirPods) and is then still with 18% there. (Fresh example from today). Since the 6s would be already 3x greased. Conclusion: Really good price / performance ratio and clear purchase recommendation.

The cardboard for such a high-quality goods was a simple cardboard box without additional bonding! After immediate complaint and Rückabwicklungswunsch came only after the second request the statement one had to deal with DHL because only complete "" packages " In my opinion, this can not be the task of the buyer in this non-delivery. In addition, now Amazon with switched on and also the DHL process in the way. Nevertheless, no action / Reaction let alone answer of the seller. My advice: Better fingers away ... have now also only Rennerei!

7161	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	☀️Sunny²	4	Fast & powerful iPhone in the old garb	2017-11-17	de	So here is my new iPhone 8, visually has changed little to the 7th: the back is made of glass and it has become a little heavier, so it has become a bit grippier and feels a little more valuable. The new A11 processor promises a higher performance and the camera has been improved once again. Cable-free charging now works with a corresponding Qi charger with 7.5 watts and old iPhone 7 cases fit perfectly. Here again the news in detail: The camera has improved Apple: A new image signal processor and a 4-speed LED flash (True Tone) and a bright maximum aperture of F1.8 get the best out of the photos raus.Hier was optimized to the right place , The camera offers: • 12 megapixel4K video recordingtimesup video • Optical image stabilization • Body and face recognition • HDR, continuous shooting, panoramas etc.The selfie HD camera has automatic image stabilization .The smartphone display acts like a flash. If you use the images with the iPhone 7 compares the colors a bit crispier and more vivid and in low light conditions a little better. The difference to the 7er is very low, a Samsung s8 makes much nicer photos like I think. Display with True ToneNew is "True Tone" known from the iPad Pro. The display automatically adapts the display to the color temperature of the ambient light.Stereo speakers for the iPhoneWhen you play games or even watch a YouTube video, you can now fully enjoy its costs.From the lower speakers and the outer ear, there is now a nice stereo sound I do not want to miss more. The jack plug has disappeared, does not really bother me. I've been using Bluetooth headphones for a while or listen to loudspeakers as I said. The iPhone 8 is waterproof to IP67. Something that is delayed will get the iPhone splash and dust protection. Have I wished for a long time, finally you are on the safe side. For underwater shots the protection is not enough , rainy phone calls or a trip to the beach is nothing in the way.The battery life is supposed to be longer despite a smaller battery of 1,821 mAh, I could not find very big differences to my iPhone 7, these are minimal. Taptic Engine Home Button: The Homebutton is not a mechanical button, but only sensor surfaces, from the Taptic Engine is now given a haptic feedback that gives the user the feeling of actually having something depressed. The habituation goes straight into the flesh, it seems somehow more modern and works perfectly. The Taptic Engine gives the user but also in other areas Feedback: if you pull down the notification center from the top of the screen, the home button will vibrate as soon as the window "hits" ". Just like the alarm clock: he rings and shakes the alarm. These are playful little things, but exactly this love to detail I like at Apple. Bluetooth 5.0 is new: The new low-energy standard doubles the transmission rate compared to Bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5.0 has an approximately 4X higher range, ideal for all Apple Watch users. Pro cool camera with good image quality in low light Waterproof housing High working speed thanks to Apple A11 processor Stereo speaker Force Touch Homebutton nice bright display with True Tone good battery life, despite smaller battery Bluetooth 5.0 Wireless charging (finally!) Cons-no larger display, yet always a thick edge- no major differences to the iPhone 7- no memory expansion- no jack►►►►► CONCLUSION: My personal highlights are of course the wireless charging and the slightly improved camera. In terms of performance, Apple has the iPhone 8 once again a fad The new A11 Fusion processor does a great job here.Bluetooth 5.0 is new and just for Apple Watch user a nice thing. Who should now update to the iPhone 8? IPhone 7 users, should take a closer look at the iPhone X, here is an update nicht.iPhone 6 or 6s users should consider an update, here you can see a real Leistungszuwachs.I'm satisfied with the device, but will be given Update time on the iPhone X.

7169	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Markes	5	The last of his kind? Let's see.	2018-01-28	de	I'm writing here on the iPhone 8 and I love it. I have previously used only Android: Sony, Huawei, Samsung After what did not quite 2 days for all features needed I am now completely in it and excited. IOS is indeed rigid and not great customizable, but it does not bother me a bit. Because everything is clean, coordinated, the phone runs like no other. Apps are open in seconds. Camera is top and also by many as the best smartphone camera ever awarded has a tremor like me but then you hate eh any camera whether big in DSLR or small in the smartphone. (Oh yes, please do not make the mistake to compare the photos of smartphones on the display but take NEN Calculator and puts them across, please thank you) Oh and the AppStore what did I hate it on Android .. vollgemüllt with cheap software that does not need anything synonymous leads to the fact that you can not find anything and with bad luck NEN Vi rus includes because nothing is properly checked. iOS makes it really reasonable software which one also finds that although good and likes money costs but ne reasonable implementation and menu guidance includes. By the way, I'm a fan of the design the glass feels from the feel of valent and makes the device even a piece heavier which I feel for me as a very pleasant. Muffo for some of the battery for me rather ... where is the problem? He keeps 1-1 / 2 days and I edit in the meantime pictures, games and surf in general pretty much. The thick frame, well, but maybe also especially now where the X out is the last in this form. The inner life is definitely the next 2 Muko for some battery or that the image from the display is displayed to neutral and not Samsung Oled style the controls up to stop aufdreht.Ich can only recommend it, but not if you own the iPhone 7 is worth it not necessarily unless you have to have the latest and if you are on the hardware. All the others maybe as well as I am annoyed by the instability of Androids and the non-coordinated components and software, which may be trusted times ran ,

7179	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	sanhchez	4	Very good, but overpriced.	2018-01-23	de	I received the iPhone 8 a few days ago as part of a contract extension. I switched from an iPhone 6s, which is now two years old, to the market in September 2015. The chip is a bit older and also the exterior is different from that of the iPhone 8. But that does not matter to me, since I always have an envelope around my cell phones so that they are also protected in the event of a fall (haha) from falling damage , Has always worked. Oh well. I'm counting now the pros and cons that have struck me so far from the iPhone 8 in comparison to the 6s. I would not have gotten any new, my current would not be so full that a data transfer to my Windows 10 PC is completely impossible, also many apps after a while no longer supported by older models.Another reason for buying was that the bundle with mobile phone was only slightly more expensive than a pure contract without a device (Muttchen is happy, if I leave her my old device) Advantages: + beautiful new glass back, but should be very vulnerable to scratches - therefore maybe only a short time beautiful + pretty gold, a mixture of the ocherstichigen gold tone of the IP6 and the rose gold of IP6s / 7: on Reddit it has even caused a surge of enthusiasm, some have sold their Space Gray model to the The phone back looks different depending on the angle of view and light, on my 1st Photo, made with the IP6s in dark hallway and with flash, it looks, for example, white, on the 2nd rather creamy + comparatively handy ( Nevertheless, the 5s was better for my Winzlingshände suitable) + improved chip + charging through Qi (although you still need to run this charging station via a socket, wodur ch for me the advantage already omitted) + allows Augmented Reality (for me personally not significantly) + Apple manufactures m. E. very valuable equipment, my daughter once poured her milk next to my cell phone - but it is still fine, once had a Samsung Galaxy S2, on the shell of a single small drop of water, the part was over + supplied accessories makes one high-quality impression - in the past, the headsets with me always easily survived two years, which was definitely different with Samsung and Nokia; The AC adapter from the charger (USB to plug) is no longer smooth, but fine "rauhfaserig", it feels so more robust and does not seem to be as hot as the old 6s + iOS GUI is personally appealing to me that of Android, also iOS is less prone to viruses u. Ä., But iOS is but rigid and has little customization options, which I do not care, because I find iOS more understandable than Android, Windows Mobile or - the almost ancient - Symbian ^^^^^ Disadvantages: ^^^^^ - missing headphone jack (jack connector) and still (at least for me) no improved sound due to two speakers at the bottom compared to 6s, you can not charge the phone at the same time while listening to music, because the Lightning connector of the charger no recess for headphones Sony Ericsson has done better since 2007, Apple sells the missing jack again as an innovation, for me that is an immense step into the past - with my use (music, video browsing, image processing, sending messages) I see better Chips no faster reactions, actually the 6s was fast enough for everything, it has never hung, I do not know how much you strain the phone n need to be able to notice a significant improvement over the devices from the last four years (from IP6); with the camera it's the same for me so far: no visible improvements and compared to the camera of my friend's Samsung it still stinks off - True Tone is comparable to the color matching of my Nokia Lumia 925 of 2013, so is not a novelty and sometimes even annoying for the little memory very expensive, 64 GB depending on the areas of use of the phone can be quickly full-bzgl.Apple, not the phone: iTunes compulsion, constant updates, since the last update, you can disable Wi-Fi only in the settings, but not in the control center ("WLAN disabled until tomorrow", who comes up with such stupid ideas ?! required for the Apple Watch and other applications ... but only clones the battery.) - The Apple batteries are generally extremely poor compared to those of other manufacturers, charging twice a day is not uncommon, although the phone is only in standby My conclusion: For the "usual" social network usage and selfie photographers, the predecessor models are still more than adequate and now cheaper to get. The phone is great, it's fast, looks good and will probably last a long time (subjective experience), the display is also acceptable. I am even glad that the same is not frameless, that would get on my nerves and I think the iPhone X, for example, totally ugly. Probably I'm just too spoiled by the 6s, so I do not appreciate the subtle changes to the new device and standard use. For the few, what has changed (meaningful!), I find the price hardly justified (ie the EIA by Apple). My purchase decision was based as I said at the beginning on a contract extension, on full memory of my old device and on the fact that its battery just barely persevere, without being forced to carry a charger in his pocket (despite stagnation and airplane mode). It offers for me compared to the 6s barely noticeable improvements, rather even the impractical deterioration that exists since the 7: The missing jack socket, because Apple beyond iTunes again needed an extra sausage. But there is ultimately just a star deduction, taken together with the short battery life, it has even lowered the mAh value compared to the 7th. I can not understand it. The Apple devices are very resistant, otherwise I would have long since looked for another manufacturer - but I can not imagine that a Huawei, LG or HTC would survive my everyday life as an Apple (because of shell and foil Dents, scratches and "Spider-App" completely alien, the 6s has already survived falls across a platform, if someone has run into my headphones). If you are looking for a mobile phone, because the 5 and the 5s will hardly be usable in the near future, a 6s or 7 is just as well advised, but should compare the prices before. For the normal EIA and without a contract, I would not buy the 8, not to camp because of the opening in front of an Apple Store, as is customary in some places.

That was always nice to me BUT if it is so it is really fun * The finger sensor works SUPER> works from any position and fast.

7181	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Produkt-Tester	5	Many new innovations ... overall a good iPhone	2017-10-04	de	The iPhone 8 is the latest smartphone from the house AppleEs is technically good, but something in the shadow of the hijacked iPhone X I have tested the phone for you and this has resulted in ... Design: Visually, the iPhone 8 reminds something to its predecessor even if the back is made of glass and the smartphone has got a surrounding frame made of aluminum. The glass case looks very classy, ​​but one had great concern that it would not exist as the case of the Samsung Galaxy case test. Apple even claims "it is the most stable glass that has ever existed in a smartphone." In a test that has iPhone 8 survived the 100 drops in the fall drum. However, the devices have not come away with it. Apple claims that the finish is produced in a seven-layer color process, which results in a particularly high color depth. Performance: The technical features are impressive. The iPhone 8 has 3 GB RAM and has the An internal controller controls a total of six cores, and for the first time, a chip integrates an Apple-developed three-core GPU. While the A10 processor of the previous generation could work a maximum of two cores simultaneously, all cores can be active at the same time on the A11. Camera and photos: With the same megapixel number compared to the predecessor, the photo quality should be better. In addition, the iPhone 8 offers a larger and faster sensor, new color filters and lower pixels. In addition, a new image processor guarantees faster autofocus, more advanced pixel processing and wider color capture. My conclusion: The iPhone 8 is definitely worth it. Although there are not much changes visually, but technology has taken a big step forward. If you liked this post, please flag it with "" useful

Of course you should already know that Android apps are not transferable on iOS and that it can not accommodate 2 SIM cards but is synonymous in any description, because some of the here 1 star ratings made this bemängelten.Ich for me am very satisfied for 5 months, it just runs without jerking and twitching and the constant updates are still up to date even after years.

Since then I have sold my apple products and I get a Windows Calculator and Android device. Actually on the iPhone 8: I am positively surprised by the device. The battery life is better than my old Android phones, the reception is much better compared to all the phones I had. The operating system is getting used to but very suitable for business use. The design is very noble. Photo are decent - the camera is one of the best on the market. The disadvantage is of course the price, for my iPhone 8 I have paid almost 1000 euros. But I do not regret a cent of the 1000 euros I spent. 2 weeks after the purchase, I think the iPhone was a good investment (I did not have that feeling many times when I bought electrical appliances). In summary: a good cell phone when you want to spend 1,000 Euros. The iPhone is very suitable for business use. If a value on battery and camera sets, he is well served with the phone.

7193	iPhone 8	256GB	Space Gray	A.D.	1	Not so good.	2018-10-05	de	Not so good! Have the iphone since March and am shocked how sensitive it is against scratches and cracks in the display and housing. Without a protective cover it should probably never be used. Software is also weak, the preinstalled card app ranges e.g. I do not need any additional apps from the competition. Very little compatibility with other products, sometimes even with those that should be made especially for Apple. Photos of the camera are in good light very good, in low light quite bad. With the standard camera app hardly any settings possible. I will hardly buy an expensive second camera app. Why are not photos taken the same size as the display? There are always edges, with videos it fits. In the beginning, wiping across the screen did not always work properly, which only got better after an update. Actually, I like the device only the performance, until now it runs smoothly and fast. There is just one star. There are deductions for the price, which is far too high. Trigger for the sensitivity. Deduction for software errors that the support will fix late or not. Fingerprint sensor does not work on slightly sweaty or wet fingers. I've read the same finger three times, now it's okay. In advertising, the man drove his skateboard through the lawn sprinkler, in reality, he would not get it unlocked ..... I'll stop writing, otherwise it will be too long.
7194	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	ovanix	5	Great iPhone	2019-02-08	de	Since Apple is no longer allowed to sell the iPhone 8 in the store, and Amazon has lowered the price of the black iPhone 8 64GB to 599 €. The decision was easy for me. My old iPhone SE was too small for me and was replaced by an iPhone 8, and I have to say that this decision was the right one. The camera is much better, the display size is finally pleasant. The Touch ID works much more precise, I do not have to make 2-5 attempts until my finger is finally recognized. I was supplied by Amazon a brand new iPhone.
7195	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Michael Herting	2	Problems with the hardware	2019-05-07	de	Even Apple seems to weaken occasionally. So are currently devices from the production period of the middle of the year 2018 called back by the manufacturer. A defect on the motherboard was found. The result showed u.a. In the form of a "" frozen "" display or the separateness of the Touchscreens.Leider I had to give back in March bought IPhone 8 again. Not all devices were affected. On the homepage of Apple is listed in more detail. At least there can be seen (input the serial number) which device is affected. I can only rate the iPhone 8 with 2 stars, although I have always been satisfied with Apple devices. Shame!
7196	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Chris	2	Apple never again	2019-04-28	de	On the phone itself everything is fine. However, I would like to write my disappointment. It's my first and also my last iPhone. The only reason I keep the device is because it allows me to calibrate my Sonos system. In my opinion, according to the current state of technology, a few things are missing on the iPhone or Apple does not consider it necessary to offer the customer a service. In the App Store, it is not possible to test apps. It means, buy it or leave it. I think there is no one who has not yet experienced that an app is not running. In the Google Store every purchase app can be tested 2 hours. It's not possible the iPhone, which has rather a smaller display, with only one hand to operate. Although Apple offers the screen virtually to bring down, but that is awkward in daily use. It simply lacks a back button or short key. The camera: Is good, but simple knit. I miss the feature that front and rear camera simultaneously take a picture and put it together. The panoramic function is only portrait, not landscape! I use SwiftKey, again Apple limits the function of writing. On the iPhone, I write a lot slower because the intuitive features of SwiftKey are limited by Apple, some are missing. Apple is forcing its users to use two-thumb spelling. And Siri is dumb compared to the Google Assistant. I have to narrow down a topic in advance. For example, if I'm looking for a street I have to tell Siri to search the internet because otherwise only the phone will be searched. The Google Assistant uses every opportunity. I do not use Siri any more. There are other things that are annoying, but that's probably my subjective opinion. Two stars, because the design is successful. Maybe that helps one or the other decide, if he wants to change to Apple ,
7197	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	ansich	1	relatively good product except for a limitation	2019-04-05	de	In principle, the device is perfect in almost all respects. However, there are two things that bother me enormously at this price. The speakers are the worst I've ever heard, they can play very loudly, but the sound quality is subterranean, the high notes are too overpresent and drown out the overall very thin sound spectrum, even the s9 felt more "bass" "2. The system performance leaves something to be desired. Noticeable in many situations are micro-stutters that should never exist at such a price.

7199	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Berki	3	Many things are out of date	2019-03-24	de	After some android I wanted to switch to an iPhone again. I deliberately chose the iPhone 8 because I wanted the home button again and a fingerprint sensor instead of Face ID. For optics and processing, you really can not say much, Apple stop and definitely beyond any doubt. What I noticed only in the setup and the test in the first few minutes that much of the IPhone is just not up to date anymore. The display is a really blurry and lifeless, if you before Samsung, Huawei etc. has used. Even the display edges are simply unacceptable for a late 2017 outgoing smartphone. In addition, I noticed that the wireless reception is very weak. With my Galaxy S9 I have some areas of the apartment still had two lines reception, whereas the IPhone has no reception at all and the WLAN does not even find. By contrast, the video camera is very good again. I can not say much about the battery, since I only had it in operation for about 30 minutes and then reset it again. On the whole, unfortunately not what I expected and therefore must return.

However, I got one with the model number xxxxxCN / A. This is probably intended for the Eastern European area. This can be seen on the packaging, since everything is described there in Polish, Romanian, Slovak or similar language. Also, the model and serial number were covered with labels over, so this is not recognizable is without opening the packaging. Basically, this is not a problem, but it should also be clearly stated that you here acquires a device, which is not intended for sale in Germany, but this is a "" Re It is also clear why the iPhone 8 can be offered here for almost 170 € below the retail price provided by Apple.

7237	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	5	Apple just	2018-06-15	de	After I had the iPhone 5 for 4 years and the display did not participate in the end, had a new smartphone ago. As my iPhone 5 convinced me completely, I realized that the next smartphone will be an iPhone again. That's why I opted for the iPhone 8. Delivery went quickly, unpacked and immediately impressed. Visually, the 8 is a real eye-catcher, not too big, not too small and fits well in the hand. The device has started up very damn fast and I was immediately offered the so-called. Quick Start feature, which I could pair the new iPhone with my iPhone 5, provided the old device has iOS 11. Of course you can also start manually, but of the quick start Feature I was pretty excited. She has taken over all apps, settings and more of my old iPhone, so you do not have to spend time with annoying settings. With the manual version, it is even possible to transfer data from an Android smartphone. Impressive! In the end I felt with the iPhone 8 as if I have been around for a while. The Touch-ID function took some getting used to, but it takes the unlocking by code. To avoid misunderstandings: The fingerprint sensor offers no security component here! Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with the iPhone 8 and therefore I will advise in the future to an iPhone purchase.
7238	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	SoCal	5	Outdated design, yet top smartphone	2018-08-03	de	Although the iPhone 8 is not a design revolution, it is still a great and modern smartphone. The glass back makes the now older design but a little more modern look, but in itself does not always have a new design, if the current is simply pertinent and in my opinion also looks good. The processing is, as Apple usual, seamless and excellent If you do not mind the thicker edges and the older design, you can safely grab the 8, instead of the X. The price difference is not justified because of a nearly borderless OLED display on the X mE, so I can recommend the handle to 8 rather , In the end, however, everyone has to decide for themselves.

7247	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Volker Hiller	5	Perfect completion of the classic iPhone series	2019-03-09	de	I own the iPhone 8 now for half a year, previously I had Android and Windows Mobile. For a long time I had reservations about Apple products, mainly because of the prices. But it's just the truth: you get here both hardware and software a quality that is second to none. iOS runs like a Swiss clockwork, so far I had no reason for any complaint. Add to that the excellent workmanship and features of the iPhone. Display, camera, TouchID, processor - all really top. For this adulation, I would not be bribed, it's just my honest conclusion, which I now come after prolonged use. I do not like the new iPhones of the X-series so much anymore, I decided to buy the iPhone 8, precisely because it is the last of the "classic" model series and is still handy with 4.7 ". I hope that Apple still thinks in the future of the friends of compact smartphones, but almost fear that you go along the trend to "bigger and bigger". But the iPhone 8 will continue to receive regular updates, so you can enjoy this smartphone for a long time.

7252	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Steven Böhme	5	Expensive cell phone with good overall impression!	2018-06-16	de	Have the phone now for almost 1 week and I have exezive busy. From the design you do not have much to talk about high quality no sharp edges and an absolutely round overall product! The hardware is usually worse than the competition highly creditable, but everything is much smoother The battery lasts for a long time synonymous with continuous operation, I have a good 10-13h total time reached until the battery was at 0 in standby, it is up to 4 days. The camera is back always perfect. Super quality and in the dark a very good overall product. No noise and no major flaws. The focus is always fast and precise top speakers are better than I expected and sound very good. The headphones also do their job. Well, I think they have an adapter to do so since the 3.5mm connection has disappeared so top! The only drawback is again not expandable memory but with 64gb, I think trzd. All in one is it again a great product as you expect it from Apple! Anyone who wants to have an all-rounder who looks very stylish and good and to do everything and still has a little money I would recommend the phone For those with a small budget rather not because there are comparatively good phones for less money!
7253	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Michelle	5	My first Iphone	2018-11-06	de	Have the iphone for about 8 months and I love it. The Iphone 8 is my first iPhone or Apple product. Sure, cheap it certainly is not but the typical other problems that my previous smartphone had (hanging the screen, crash of apps, broken micro etc) I could not yet determine. Of course, everything can change after 2 years but so far I do not regret the purchase a bit.
7254	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Peter Assfalg	1	No help, just rip off	2019-06-13	de	Unfortunately, I have had very disappointing and bad experiences: After a few years and two android phones, I decided again for an Apple iPhone and bought me in September 2018, a new iPhone 8 for around 650 ¬. I was completely satisfied and fell in love again with the surface, the handling, the operation and the shape. I could not have imagined a better phone ... Until in May 2019 suddenly my outdoor camera stopped responding, my flashlight stopped working and the mobile phone often reported a simcard error. Over a three-quarters of a year, I was very careful and handled the phone carefully. I never fell down and was protected all the time with a solid case and a protective glass. So I thought: A clear guarantee. After a short phone call with the AppleSupport the phone was picked up for repair at my home and was already in the repair center at Apple 2 days after the phone call. In the phone call, I was told that Apple repaired any damage or repaired no damage at all. After a few days, I got feedback from Apple: On my phone, another defect was found, which does not include the warranty and thus expire. There were pictures of the corresponding "defect" attached. These were my loudspeakers, in which was dirt, lint, etc. of my trouser pocket. I already knew that. Anyway, Apple declared this as a defect and demanded for the total repair of my eight month old iPhone a contribution of 317,02 € + tax (!!!!). I feel pulled over the table and unrestrained abgezockt.Warum I pay 650 ¬ for a telephone, which has eight months after technical failures, then I'll even crappy for my warranty and on top of that also roughly ¬ 350 as repair costs for damage that is not in my responsibility is to pay? Why should one still buy Apple products there? For 350 ¬ there are now android phones that have at least as good a performance as the iPhone 8. What I find almost saddest: not a coworker has my actually problem, the defective camera or the flashlight ever accepted. Neither at the 'repair' nor on the phone. It was always about the speaker "defect" and about the fact that I alone have to pay for the repair. I have the cell phone returned unrepaired and have visited a local mobile workshop. I have during the Apple "repair" almost 14 days to give up my mobile phone. An indictment of a company like Apple. Here, as a customer as I have now found, just ripped off. To offer the customer help stands at Apple probably now at the bottom. That would never have been in the sense of the inventor. I am very disappointed.

7265	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	volox	5	A very good iPhone (but the battery could be better)	2018-01-13	de	Hello, I think I do not have to comment on the technical details, because there is enough information on the internet. Overall, I am very satisfied with the technique. If you have an iPhone that is not many years old, you do not have to buy the iPhone 8. For example, I had the iPhone 5c before and now I switched to the iPhone 8. This was definitely worth it. That design is great. Especially with the glass back. I bought the space gray model. Inductive charging works well. It only takes about half an hour longer for the device to be charged (estimated). I recommend everyone here to charge the iPhone 8 with an iPad power supply, for example, 12W. This is much faster than inductive charging and faster than normal charging via the included power supply. Plus, you do not have to spend a lot of money on a MacBook power adapter for the fast-charging function. In addition, I recommend that you buy a case for the phone, because the glass back is certainly very sensitive. The only big negative aspect of the iPhone eight is, in my opinion, that the battery could be better. In my opinion, this keeps much too short. All in all, it's a good smartphone. The shipping did not work well with me, although I had selected the premium shipping. The device took four days instead of three, but I think that this is not Amazon's fault, but Hermes. For example, if you ship your device through DHL, I do not need to worry about the product arriving too late.
7266	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Alexander Winter	5	An iPhone remains an iPhone	2018-02-23	de	You can or you have to summarize this review. Except for a new chipset, a slightly better camera, as with the 7er already the IP certification and new colors, there is nothing spectacular new here And that's a good thing. It's just as usual since there are iPhones. The operating system is the main point here. All in all, you get the hardware passive with the hardware. My 5er ran smoothly, my 5s also, 6 and 6s as well. My wife has a 7 plus and that too runs and runs. I notice now the 8er no difference. If you compare the 4 and the 8, that will of course be noticed. But in the way you got used to it bit by bit. I can not do without Face-ID and borderless displays without Homebutton. Good system, good hardware, feel and look are just as great, no matter if iPad, iPod or whatever. Whether you want to spend the money, you have to decide for yourself. No one builds bad phones anymore.
7267	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Liislaa95	4	Great price, great phone	2018-04-10	de	I love the phone. It is super packed and it is certainly an original. Unbeatable for the price.

It is much faster in really all areas (unlocked by fingerprint now in a split second). The photos have a great quality and live photos are now finally possible. Why should I pay 100 Euro more to order it at A ... or to buy it at the store? Shipping and packaging in the usual Amazon quality. 1A goods !!!
7269	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	JoeCool	5	Moving from iPhone 6 to 8	2017-11-27	de	Have now completed a personal move from the Iphone 6 on the current Iphone 8. The size of both devices is identical, only the faster CPU and the larger RAM are in everyday life very positive auf.The back of the 8er is now completely made of glass, so Being somewhat more sensitive like the 6-series. Through the glass backside the charge via induction (QI standard) is now possible, but have not yet tried it. All in all, I am very satisfied with the iPhone 8

7271	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Yona	5	After 5 years Android	2018-03-22	de	After 5 years of Android usage I did not want anymore and decided to buy an iPhone 8 from Apple. I have to say: It's not perfect, but miles better than the competition from Android! The performance, the integration of the apps and iOS in general is simply much better prepared than with e.g. Samsung.I can only recommend it to anyone!
7272	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	M. L.	4	Almost perfect smartphone according to today's standard	2017-10-19	de	Hello, First of all, I switched from an iPhone 5S to the iPhone 8, which of course is a quantum leap. In addition to many new features, wireless charging, water-repellent or waterproof, larger display have the usual abilities such as camera, touch ID, processor, speakers, Unfortunately, the iPhone also has some "smaller" disadvantages. First, let's take a look at the "" highlights "" - the camera is absolute cream, the iPhone shoots classy photos in good light conditions Users are completely sufficient. In poor lighting conditions, you just realize that it is a smartphone and not a real camera. The photos are indeed usable, for a smartphone certainly synonymous with the top 3 smartphone cameras but just not suitable for a glossy magazine.- The display is sufficiently sharp and offers very natural colors. The brightness is also great. The viewing angle is not distorted the good presentation.- The processor is fast, nothing hooked, I think here you are well stocked for 3-4 years.- The processing on the iPhone is impeccable.Otherwise, it has all the typical Apple advantages, the largest is iOS 11, a clear, varied and I think secure operating system with about 4-5 years support for updates. This is an absolute unique selling point which I do not want to miss. Now the negative characteristics - the battery is enough for 1 day of intensive use, 2 days of normal use, that's a pity since it would have been more feasible. - The design is indeed timelessly beautiful, Nevertheless, the edges are too thick by today's standard, you could have built the iPhone with the same screen size certainly more compact. I assume Apple does not do that for production reasons, as it will be cheaper to continue using the almost old dimensions. But that's just a guess. The dual camera would have earned the iPhone 8 at this price, the PLUS model is simply too big for many. It's a pity that the Apple is still different. Neutral, I see the price, everyone can decide how much he spends. Class I think that Apple also older models (iPhone 7), etc. in the program reserves, so there is actually an iPhone for every budget. That's why I do not understand the price discussions, whoever wants to have the latest, fastest, best just has to put notes on the table. Punkt.Ebenso I refer to the very good resale value of iPhones, if you treat them reasonably you can even after 2-3 years still require several hundred euros for it. This does not work for Samsung and Co. These are somehow verramscht.Ich hope that I could help some with this review.

And I wanted the latest technology. Camera is still bisssl better, true tone display very neat, wireless load perfect, fastest processor awesome, the new haptics in the system great. Image stabilization on board now. New home button. And in addition waterproofness, it was worth the change! I recommend front and back ne protection film from scratches. Alternative to the X is it. * Edit * I have now changed to the xx size and new fresher design *
7275	iPhone 8	256GB	Argent 	Kindle-Kunde	5	Buy recommendation! iPhone 8 (Silver / 256GB)	2018-02-10	de	I bought the iPhone somewhere else, but that's not relevant. I had a 6s before and had to choose between the iPhone X and the 8. Due to the love for the Homebutton, the mostly same technology and the extra charge, I have now for the 8 decided .... And it does not regret. The speed is great and I would not indulge the inductive charging! The glass back makes a very high quality impression. The camera and the display are as usual sharp (the LCD display is the OLED display in no way)! Even if the iPhone is not cheap, in my opinion worth the extra price for the larger Speicherervariante.Der jump from 64 to 256 GB is quite large. I also agree with other previous speakers, once iPhone always iPhone.I already had the 3G, the 4, the 5s, the 6s and now the 8.I think it will not be the last ...
7276	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Arne T.	5	Better, as always!	2018-01-27	de	Since the iPhone X has finally broken my pain threshold in the price, I actually felt the iPhone 8 as a very good deal. Just over 4 years ago I paid € 799,00 for a 32GB iPhone 5s and today I get an iPhone 8 with at least 64GB.Now the iPhone 8. You get exactly what you expect. A valuable lightning fast phone with a nice camera and a cable store and yes, the Qi charger must of course to the socket, where else should the power come from? The display is good, for an IPS even very good, but can not with the Amoled of Keep up with X or Galaxy S8. The latter I had before the 8 and thus the display in the iPhone 8 does not seem so outstanding. There is no help for Truetone. But, clearly, worlds are better than Samsung's is the standby consumption on iOS and that's just Apple. On weekdays, I get so loose about two with a battery charge, that was almost impossible with the S8. Next, it is that since the iPhone 7 stereo speakers, which are really okay, depending on the sound source, sometimes even excellent and again a comparison to Find, many times better than the monaural speaker of the Galaxy S8. Conclusion, the iPhone 8 is a total of a top device.
7277	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Sarah704	5	The change was worthwhile	2018-01-28	de	For 8 years I had mostly Android smartphones and of course was very happy with it. But now - 2018 - I finally wanted something "different". I decided after a short time for the iPhone 8. Before the purchase, I have been informed about this device intensively. And I can say - yes, it was worth it, I am very enthusiastic and never thought how many options you have with Apple. First impression: The phone looks totally chic and high quality, just by the glass facade and the display. But I have to say, compared to my S7 Edge it's quite "" heavy "", but you get used to it. Operation: Of course you have to get used to the functions of iOS. Often "" touche "" I still on the nonexistent "" back button "", but of course that's pure habit. Still, I'm fascinated how fast and smooth the phone works and at the same time it's still "" quiet "" , I would prefer not to put it away, even if the battery is less than 2000 mAh, it currently lasts longer than my S7 Edge (which is in my possession for 1.5 years) The integrated fingerprint sensor works perfectly and smoothly. I saved my two thumbs and just used the index finger to test it. My phone could not be unlocked and that shows me how accurate the sensor works. Camera: Selfies and normal photos are now razor-sharp and catch much more details. The color is very intense. Photos with flash are no longer totally overexposed, but of course. In addition, some pretty filters were installed, which give the photo again a bit of individuality. Microphone + Speaker: Meanwhile, so many voice messages are made and listened to by many. The microphone of the iPhone is great, many already said that my voice is much clearer and clearer with less background noise (compared to the S7 Edge). But also the voice messages of others are no longer like "" noise "", but pleasant. Music or other sounds seem to me as if I had high quality speakers connected to the iPhone, although it is only the speakers of the phone itself. Additional recommendation: Since the device is made of glass, I recommend everyone a bulletproof glass (cheap to find here on Amazon) and a protective cover, so that the protection and the value is maintained long! Conclusion: I do not regret this purchase and me recommend this device to all people who would like to experience something different than Android!
7278	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	rumpelstielchen	3	My first I Phone ... maybe the last one ...	2018-02-03	de	To prehistory: I have previously used a Microsoft Lumia 950 Dual Sim phone. That was just convenient because I only had to lug around a cell phone with me and was separated professionally and privately just clean. In addition, the compatibility with the company software was given, which then animated me to buy Lumia. Meanwhile, my company switched to I Phones. Since there are no Apple Dual SIM variants (why probably only Apple) and an Android phone for me was out of the question (very bad experience from the past), so I decided to buy the I Phone 8.The first surprises I experienced while transferring the data from the old phone to the I Phone. Without I Tunes or I Cloud nothing works ... Whats App Backups from Windows transferred ... Pustekuchen. That was a lot easier with Windows ... The operating system seems a lot more complicated than WIN10 mobile. Example: I tried to write a mail and in parallel to look in another mail what ... does not work ... or I'm too stupid for who knows ... But there are of course also positive to report: The feel, the speed, the camera and the stability of the operating system as well as the hardware processing are really great. But you may also ask for a price of over 700, - €. Overall, I understand the hype about Apple products but not quite. For my part, I feel already bothered by the compulsive defaults that Apple partially makes (software use, memory upgrades, battery, etc ...). Whether I will stay with Apple will show the time. Too bad that it has not understood the leadership of Microsoft, to gain a foothold in the mobile phone market ... From the handling was my WIN10 mobile by far the most ...
7279	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	wilfried56	5	reliable delivery at a low price	2018-02-05	de	The delivery of the iPhone 8 was as announced already after a few days, the goods were originally packed and corresponded exactly to my wishes, elegant in design and intuitive to use.
7280	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	P.M.	5	Mellow iPhone 6	2017-12-30	de	I'm very satisfied. The iPhone 8 can also be regarded as the second major facelift of the iPhone 6 (except for the 6s). The degree of maturity is therefore very high. The design has been further perfected. The form factor is almost perfect for me. In addition, there is the possibility of inductive charging. I deliberately decided against the X, even though I was about to buy it. Face ID (slower than Touch ID and sometimes awkward) and OLED (risk of burn-in is still present - especially in applications such as Google Maps) are simply not yet mature for me. Especially in view of a price of over € 1000. The new A11 Bionic is incredibly fast. There are virtually no delays. Above all, surfing the Internet is felt partly faster than a current Notebook.Auch the camera system has been further optimized. The noise behavior in the low light range is even better than in my five-year-old SLR camera. The dynamic range is also very good. The bottle neck is here still the small lens. Picture details are still relatively blurred. This can be seen only in greatly enlarged images. Overall, for a smartphone but a very considerable Bildqualität.Ich can recommend the iPhone 8 so much!

7282	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Pusheen	4	Apple Iphone 8 - detailed review	2018-02-05	de	Welcome to my review of the Iphone 8 from Apple. As a small warning to those who do not want to read a detailed review -> to the conclusion scroll. Foreword: ------------------------------ -------------- I do not own an Iphone 8, I could test it extensively only within the family for a week. I was a long time owner of an Iphone 6s and would like to compare a bit to this. Technical data 4.7 inches with 750 x 1,334 pixelsProcessor: Apple A11 Bionic (Hexa-Core) 64 GB memory (depending on version, approx. 51 GB available, not expandable) Camera 1.8 operating system 1,821 mAh (iFixit value) Design and processing: --- ----------------------------------------- The design has not much to the Iphone 6s done on the front, there are always the same bars, both above and below. On the back, but has changed a lot, the aluminum that extended at 6s over the entire back, was now limited to the edges and replaced with glass .The logo was embedded in the glass and can no longer be felt , the transition from the aluminum frame to the glass surface is perfect, the only difference you can tell is the temperature difference. The only negative point here, which has already bothered me in the Iphone 6s, the camera protrudes on the housing out. The processing of the iPhone 8 shows At the highest level, as has been the tradition at Apple for years. No burr or gap disturbs the haptic. The processing of the device is as always at the highest level, the design can be up to the glass back after so many generations to be desired ... for this 4.5 / 5 stars.Display: - ------------------------------------------- The Iphone 8 has a 4, 7 inches display with a resolution of 750x1334 pixels, a similar or even the same was installed in the Iphone 6s, but that is by no means negative. The sharpness leaves nothing to be desired and the secondary services convince as already familiar from the previous models. Thus, the readability in flat plan view is excellent and the colors and sharpness remains stable when turning in front of the eye for a very long time. The 3D touch function was already at 6s, here it is even more mature, it can, for example, even before opening Once you get used to the function, it accelerates the use of some apps and the access, for example, to the settings a lot. Unfortunately, there is nothing new from the display, everything was somehow available in older models ... so it is not bad ... I give 4.5 / 5 Sterne.Ausstattung and performance: -------------------- ------------------------ In the Iphone 8 is an A11 Bionic chip installed which should work much more efficient than its predecessors, but is that true? Yes, the computing power is bombastic, the Iphone 6s had a good performance, this is where the Iphone 8 again Apple has equipped the Hexa core chip with two high-performance cores and four lower-clocked cores that consume less power. The control of the smartphone is always very fluent and parallel operation as well as complex apps and applications are very quickly executed or operated .Heating the Iphone 8 is noticeable, but is still far from overheating. The performance of the Iphone 8 is bombastic, here Apple has again done first-class work, as it is already used by Apple. Here you can only 5/5 Awarded star.Telephone and call quality: -------------------------------------------- The main task of a mobile phone is, as you can imagine, the phone calls. This succeeds with the Apple iPhone 8 also great, which was not surprising and was to be expected. The sound quality is at a good level. Talks conducted on the ear sound clear, are loud enough on both sides, and can be conducted without delays. When handsfree mode is used, it becomes clear that the loudspeaker can not quite keep up with the rest of the sound quality. At moderate volume, there's nothing to complain about, but turn the knob up and overdrive the speaker over and over again. Nevertheless, the performance in this area is absolutely sufficient. Here I give 4.5 / 5 Sterne.Kamera: --------------------------- ----------------- The 12 megapixel camera makes very good pictures, here there is also, as with its predecessors, nothing to complain about. Nevertheless, the setting options leave something to be desired, No portrait effects, zooms or similar. Other smartphones in this price range already offer dual cameras with far more functionality. Even with selfies, there are not really features to optimize the images, neither filters nor cosmetics settings. Unfortunately, the evolution of the camera since the Iphone 6s somewhat faltering, the camera is for me the biggest negative point of the Iphone 8, this makes other providers much better. For this I give 4/5 Sterne.Software and multimedia: -------------------------------------- ------ Equipped with the new operating system iOS 11, there were some innovations on the Apple front, that control center was completely redesigned, the notification area was summarized with the lock screen and a darker hue was also missed the operating system. Who likes screenshots iOS 11 can be updated with new editing tools, which also make handwritten annotations on screenshots easy. The function "" outsource apps "" should make full iPhone memory the end.The system will simply delete unused apps, or offload them to the cloud. In the process, personal data and settings are retained and are available for reinstallation as if nothing had happened. Thus, the question when buying "" What memory size do I have to grow? "" The voice quality of Siri was in contrast to the 6s It's now also possible to chat with the language assistant. Apple has not set a milestone with iOS11 or reinvented the wheel, everything is running smoothly and harmoniously. For this I give 4.5 / 5 Sterne.Akku: -------------------------------------- ------ In my battery test, which I have done with the iPhone 6s so I come to the following figures in the 24-hour test 52% - After another 16 hours in standby: 37% It can be said, after 8 hours intensive use (videos, whatsapp, telephony, etc.), the battery stood still 52%. The remaining 16 hours spent the device in standby mode and went after 24 hours with 37% battery from the test, this is not bad, but also not outstanding ... it may well be that you have to insert a "pit stop" on the charging cable during intensive use. For this I give 4/5 stars. Conclusion 4,5 / 5Display: 4,5 / 5Ausstattung und Leistung: 5 / 5Phone and call quality: 4.5 / 5Camera: 4 / 5Software and Multimedia: 4.5 / 5Total: 4 / 5The Apple iPhone 8 is no bad phone. With the fast computer, the unique selling point iOS and the outstanding workmanship as well as a simple and never hooking user feeling it brings the classical strengths Apple with itself. But one thing Apple has set for the iPhone 8: the pursuit of "" one more thing "" or less cluttered, the urge for innovation. Compared to the Iphone 6s everything seems somehow known and "" old "", it is called "" Never Change a running system "", but a fresh wind at Apple would not hurt me. Nevertheless, I can give a buy recommendation here! I hope my review could help you.
7283	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Sivan A.	3	Either I'm pretty unlucky, or Apple can not build mobile phones anymore!	2018-01-13	de	It's just amazing. At the beginning of December, after three years of using an iPhone 5, I bought the new iPhone 8. I looked forward to it so animalically, and felt emotions during unboxing, which I had never had before! I was completely satisfied and set up the device. As stupid as I was, I did not pay attention to the outside ... Only the next day, I noticed processing errors on the device. The gaps between glass and aluminum frame on the back were quite large. On the sides they were o. K., But above all a clear gap was felt. I then made use of my right of withdrawal and returned the device. Then I ordered it elsewhere, because it was cheaper there ... Also, this device had similar errors. The gap dimensions were not quite as big now. On top of that, however, the mute switch rattled quite a bit when he was in the top position. I sent it to Apple this time because I thought they would know what to do. But then came the disappointment: they simply sent the device back to me unprocessed. Was added a remark that the device is flawless. But that was not it. I then researched the Internet, and found that other iPhone eight models have this gap. However, I also had an iPhone 8 Plus in my hand, which did not have these problems. Also the problems with the mute switch had two devices that I did not have in my hand. I then really tried to live with these annoying problems, and to accept the whole thing. Now comes to the fact that I noticed now after a few weeks of use, that in the video recording with the main camera a crack in the sound can be heard. But this has only occurred now, in the beginning this was not heard in video recordings. I do not know what to think about it. Apple did not do anything, and now I'm sitting here with this faulty device. It's fast and looks fancy. You have to leave that to him, but somehow I wish I had never switched to the iPhone 8.
7284	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Peter	5	Top Smartphone	2017-10-21	de	Top mobile phone. Do not be influenced by tests. I do not know a smartphone which makes better photos. And who wants a compact phone is well advised. Accu is also very good and everything runs smoothly. At all the blasphemers no envy arise.
7285	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Kevin Braun	5	Performance is unbeatable	2017-12-11	de	As the smartphone age began, I always had Android devices, which were slow and therefore useless with time. Therefore, I bought with the 5s the then flagship of Apple and I remained loyal to the model 8. First impression: The iPhones were In my opinion, always the fastest models on the market and that has not changed with the iPhone 8. In the processing Apple has once again done everything right and this time even the back with a glass instead of aluminum versehen.Diese is the device a little better as the predecessors in the hand. Of course, through the glass, the weight of the iPhone has increased a bit. It is great in the hand and you can reach everything without problems. If not (especially for users of the "" Plus "" variant) there is still the possibility with two gentle touches on the home button to pull the current app down to the center of the screen. Of course, this device also has no headphone jack, so you have to work with a Lightning adapter. (This is not enclosed with the device and must be purchased separately. Cost about 10 €) But now something that has me a little disappointed.The Camera: Here Apple uses a new camera sensor. These make excellent images and are among the best that the smartphone range has to offer. In low light, the detail resolution has become a little better and the colors look more natural than before. The Google Pixel, or Samsung Note 8 get in the dim light anyway the exposure better. For details are usually heraus¬ worked better. Therefore, it must be said that both Android devices rather strong colors and the iPhone acts more restrained, but mostly the correct hue hits. Next the known problem, Akku.Akku: Of course, the iPhones were never known for their long runtimes, but the iPhone 8 is slightly better than the predecessor. The battery has shrunk again, but you notice nothing. Of course, it is not enough for top positions. After a working day without much use, the iPhone does not necessarily have to be charged, with moderate use even two days drin.Samsung, LG and Google create here with the top models mehr.Mal again is a 5- Watt power supply to the device. Since the iPhone also supports USB Power Delivery, after 30 min already 50% percent load. The appropriate USB-C to Lightning cable with power adapter costs about 90 € with Apple. If it is a bit cheaper, should be with the wireless charging (Qi). Since the iPhone 8, this feature is given and is cheap to get thanks to widespread standard (about 15 €). Conclusion: A technically excellent smartphone with a cool design. For the next few years it has enough performance, the battery life is good and the display respectable. Thanks to 12 megapixels makes the iPhone great and beautiful pictures. The changes to the predecessor are minimal. The expensive quick charge and wireless charging is slow and rarely practical. That's why I think it's more of a 7s than an 8. For users of an iPhone 7, or 6s worth the transition, because the improvements are hardly noticeable in everyday life.
7286	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Onur D.	3	Well, where is Jack?	2018-02-21	de	iPhone 8 looks like a 6 but is at a slightly better level of performance. But the missing jack connection is still a big issue so that I can use my good headphones only with the enclosed scrap adapter. But a switch to android is unimaginable for me, because in the past I only had problems with android devices.
7287	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	IlikeAmazon	5	Great device, as you are used to ...	2017-12-21	de	iPhone 8 - This is already a great device ... With the iPhone 8, Apple introduces a new generation of smartphones, which convinces by exciting exciting features, strong performance and an elegant design. What I really like is that the iPhone 8 is made of very sturdy glass and aluminum. Feels great in the hand. To the improved flawless retina display. Also new is that the smartphone can be charged wirelessly. Already a great thing. The iPhone 8 is based in its design clearly on the previous model, but sets new standards, especially in terms of display, speaker and camera quality. It consists of a 4.7 inch HD retinal display integrated 3D Touch.Eine further improvement was also in terms of color accuracy. Thanks to the automatic white balance of the new True Tone technology, the display adapts to the lighting conditions in your environment, ensuring a pleasant and relaxed viewing experience. The natural colors not only protect your eyes, but also show all images, videos and games razor-sharp .25% louder than the 7 Series 12 megapixel camera with wide-angle lens .... Even in low light and using the flash, you can take professional pictures with sharp details and blurry backgrounds in portrait mode. You can now get slow motion videos in a full HD resolution. The 7 megapixel front camera with integrated retina flash and image stabilization ensures that every selfie becomes a small work of art. The dimensions are67.3mm x 138.4mm x 7.3mm148grams
7288	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Caroline Konrad	5	The best iPhone since the 5s	2017-11-08	de	After the iPhone 5s certainly one of the best iPhones so far. Top size and weight. Absolutely perfect workmanship and speed that is second to none ... simply terrific. By contrast, my S8, which I had before really not good. And I thought that Samsung has been unbeatable since the s6 in terms of speed. But I was wrong. The iPhone 8 opens everything immediately. Really IMMEDIATELY. As it should be with any smartphone these days. The loading screen in asphalt needed smooth 5 seconds and you can go jet ... Phenomenal and so still seen on any cell phone ... Camera top. Display top (and again and again the proof that nobody needs more than Full Hd on a mobile phone) Battery lasts for less than 1.5 days. With much use about 20-26 hours. That's ok. Now the box is finally waterproof and can be charged wirelessly. Yes. The ipunkt, which unfortunately was standard for many other manufacturers for a long time. And the stereo speakers are also awesome. Thanks for that! I fell in love with the iPhone again after a long Samsung trip. A great part!
7289	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Bartinho	3	Enthusiasm looks different	2018-04-26	de	Switching from my Lumia 950 with Windows 10 mobile to the iPhone 8 was extremely difficult. To be honest, I do not know why iPhones have always been so highly praised. Given the high price to pay for it, I understand it all the less. Compared to my Lumia 950, the iPhone 8 is not necessarily an advance. Clearly positive to emphasize is that the iPhone is very fast and everything runs very smoothly. The operating system is in comparison to Windows 10 mobile, however, a Rückschritt.iOS is boring and I miss many useful and practical functions. What advantages or useful and great Features Windows 10 mobile has (or had) I do not need to tell those who know it. Anyone else can care, they will hardly use it anymore given the fact that the system is unfortunately phased out Overall I'm not dissatisfied, but I would have expected a lot more. One point deduction for what, given the bid, high price, a point deduction for the boring operating system and the lack of many useful functions. More than three stars I can unfortunately not awarded for the iPhone 8.
7290	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Erik Scherzinger	5	Upgrade from iPhone 7	2017-10-10	de	Got a reasonable price for my iPhone 7 and then bought the iPhone 8. Well, the innovations are limited. The old proven design continues, but that's a point that would not even bother me. Much more bothers me because of the battery. It has not gotten any better (actually smaller, but Apple promised more uptime with a more power efficient processor). Otherwise, there is again a good iPhone with a brilliant camera and top hardware, especially with a Cpu, which is ahead of the competition 50%. In plain language ... Apple has swept the competition out of the way for a long, long time. Worth mentioning is the stereo sound. Who has an iPhone 7, knows how good it already sounds there, but the iPhone 8 is even better and sounds much fuller, louder and sauberer.Apple has clearly brought a good improvement with unfortunately the same look, but a lot, would have been much more expandable. I opted for the iPhone 8 because I do not like the iPhone X visually. Since Samsung has brought something nice on the market with the S8, but with your unacceptable software and me just had an Ios ago. Never again Android I say only. From me a clear Buy recommendation. Not maybe if you have an iPhone 7, but who can take it financially will be happier with the camera and the stereo sound.
7291	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	Marving	4	Pros and cons!	2017-10-12	de	Moin Moin, I just wanted to give my opinion on the new iPhone 8 or 8+ here for a short time. Pro - no dual camera (except 8 +) - Average contrast - no fast charger power supply - less running time than the iPhone 7 - no 3.5 mm jack for audio connections1. Design and Display: - Same Display Size - Low Contrast Rate - True Tone Display (more natural colors) 2. Camera- 12 Megapixel Resolution- 7 Megapixel Selfie Camera- Because of the A11 chip, movements, lighting conditions and faces are detected and adjusted before shooting- iPhone 8 does not have dual camera- iPhone 8+ has dual camera (so for photofreaks it's best to select the +);) - Movies are possible in 4k mode, but slow motion only in Full HD3. Processor or benchmarks, speaker A11 chip 25% louder speakers than the predecessor faster than the iPhone 7 (twice as fast as the Smasung Galaxy S8) 4. Battery and battery life 1821 milliamps (predecessor had 1960) - Battery life is not drastically reduced, but a little wireless loadable possible, but only with charging station !!!! not included in the iPhone itself! (but costs only 70-90 ¬) - with Lightning cable on it charges faster than over induction I hope you liked the review and I could advise you a little on your purchase. Conclusion: The upgrade from 7 to 8 is worth it in my opinion not after. Of 5 or 6, however, it makes sense if the money is available, of course.
7292	iPhone 8	256GB	Space Gray	Gast	3	Goes so	2018-03-05	de	Switch from Android to iOS. I do not know what should be better on the iPhone than on Android. Each fucking app costs something, 6 hours I needed to set up and you can not even design screens as you like. A little weak for a cell phone that can supposedly do everything
7293	iPhone 8	64GB	Argent 	TheRock	1	No Thanks for patronizing iTunes 12.7 I prefer to go back to Android.	2017-12-30	de	Great device, handy, fast, solid ................ But, I do not allow this patronizing of iTunes, with 12.7 I can not even use my own mp3 as a ringtone ... Thanks, no, throttles the performance of your devices and "curbs" your customers with extremely overpriced devices.
7294	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Olaf N. Amazon Kunde	1	back again	2018-02-01	de	I have an Ipad, I am very happy with that, but the Iphone, no! we are now living in the 21st century, and just because it's apple ??? my apps, which I bought for my Android, are not transferable! You have to pay again! Great! 1 slot !! That's a joke! On my Android device I have 2 slots, for business and home, plus a slot for a memory card! Ok, apple has an adapter, of course, everything costs extra, and the iphone anyway almost 3 times as expensive as the Android .... etc. etc.

7296	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Gray	Richtig	5	Top!	2019-06-18	de	Great mobile without problems. The phone is expensive but worth the money.
7297	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Shoppingphantom	2	Not as good as the 6s	2019-07-09	de	I've been using iPhones 3, 5, 6s, and now 8, which I did not buy from Amazon for years. But I think the Amazon is the best 'consumer channel' for a review. I've been using the phone for about half a year, and basically it's still a great smartphone but not as good as the 6s. But there are a few points that are really annoying: - The missing headphone input. Of course, there is a matching headphone and an adapter with it, so that especially perfectly organized people have no problem with it. Unfortunately, I can not bite, and of my many headphones fits now only one, and that, who is currently not there, and the adapter, I also constantly misplaced.- The GPS reception in the car is not working properly. It sometimes takes minutes for the phone to hear that I've turned off. It is probably a common problem with the reception, which is discussed on communities, I had so far only time to worry about it and have no solution- The new home button is also getting used to. He has no more resistance than at the 6s and often he just does not react. One presses desperately repeatedly until something happens.We still wonder that sales of iPhones is weakening. Perhaps Apple executives should increasingly think about whether they are acting in the interests of their customers. Incidentally, this also applies to the further development of iOS. Personally, I would wish for many features and Apple apps, the aspect of simple and straightforward usability back into focus. The two stars explicitly include the comparison with the previous one.

Since I am still attached to the home button, it had to be an iPhone 8 again and of the functions and the photo quality of this mobile phone is always enough.

That does not matter to me, as long as it does its job and holds for a few years:) Can not complain after a month, on the contrary. I made sure on the website of apple that it is new. That was it. So from me for the price clear purchase recommendation! :)
7302	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Alena Weichert	1	A disappointment from Amazon.	2018-09-12	de	I have received the phone in an externally good condition. It should be an original product. Unfortunately it was not in perfect condition. After only 3 weeks it started to crash. Meanwhile, the music playback, the camera and the phone does not work properly. The use of the product is mainly problematic. I'm assuming that I have not received a new product. I bought the phone directly through Amazon to exclude just as disappointing ability. Unfortunately, I spent 900 ¬ for a broken product. Too bad.
7303	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	K.Gaen	5	Excellent goods!	2018-08-31	de	Was a bit skeptical at first because the smartphone is sold much cheaper than in all electrical markets. However, the iPhone has been around for a few months and I'm still very satisfied. The mobile phone was delivered undamaged and works perfectly.
7304	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	K. P.	2	Display zerkratzt	2018-11-11	de	I'm a big fan of Apple and have already had the iPhone 4, iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 in front of the iPhone 8 plus and was also very happy with it. But on the iPhone 8 plus display, I already have so many scratches although I'm just as good or poor as the predecessor treat. That's why I'm already thinking about whether I'll zulege again an older model. Apple Care replaced the display unfortunately only at break or another defect. Therefore, I give only 2 stars and they are almost too much ,
7305	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	andreas freisinger	1	Device apparently not new	2019-02-01	de	Was very disappointed with the product, the cell phone was delivered purely from the packaging is not a new device, the package was obviously already opened and re-glued again, also was the barcode on the back of the packaging just torn off. Since the appearance of the packaging made me startling, I sent the thing back immediately. Annoying that a new phone is sold for $ 800 proud and then you get something, even more at Christmas (was a gift). If I buy a new device, then (especially at the price) must be completely new - especially since I could not technically check the device. Unfortunately, I can only advise against it

7350	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Benny	5	The underrated flagship iphone with 8 times plus	2017-12-25	de	Oh yes, the iPhone X (ten or ten) is so beautiful, so innovative, so great and in general, the best there is in the world. Is that really? And why is the 8+ in so many so-called "magazines" ", all write more or less the same crap, as if they distribute the articles among themselves and would only slightly change, so neglected treated? I use iPhones because I, at least to Time to have a little more confidence in the Apple Privacy Policy than in the Google Privacy Policy. Tim Cook is always saying that Apple does not live on selling data, just selling hardware and OS's, but the "" X "" is for me a device that a. too fragile, b. too expensive (even the 8+ is not a snapper but just in painful setting) and c. Technically bringing innovations that I neither need nor want! So the 8+ has exactly 8 good (buy) reasons for me (of course there is more) and I'm really happy with it! 1. Timeless and beautiful form. Yes, I do not think they are stale but successful and I like them! In addition, great stereo speakers that are quite enough for occasional listening to music, Samsung still does not get the S8 with the S8. Super fast A11 Bionic processor Incredible fix! As has the "" X "" synonymous nothing better, namely, has the same processor. Glass back allowing wireless charging. I do not mind, especially since the open Qi standard can be used. Glass back thereby lower SAR value (compared to iPhone 7+). Personally, I think it's important! 5. Again improved camera through the new signal processor. Very important to me! 6. High quality LCD display, no "burn in" possible as with OLEDs (iPhone X) and therefore natural colors.7. Super battery life. Only Apple gets with comparatively small batteries such maturities out. You have to admit that without any reason.8. And now the best for me. Still Touch ID. I do not want a face scanner. Apple leaves the customer but once again no choice. One would have at the fragile (test - Stiftung Warentest) "" X "", similar to Huawei or Samsung, behind a fingerprint scanner install and then leave the customer the choice. But no, that would have meant additional costs and limited the profits. Instead, the "" fans "" made it clear that this is a musthave ". it is, at least for me, but not! I feel the fingerprint scanner as perfect and it works absolutely fast and reliable! No idea what I do, if there are only iPhones with Facescanner ?? Otherwise there is not much to say. iPhone just great quality, everything works as it should, works perfectly with my MacBook together, gets years of updates. The high price will be amortized, because I will use the device the next (at least) 4 years. I can only recommend the iPhone 8 Plus. In this form, it is proven, protected with protective cover against falls, battery can be with some Bastlergeschick yourself exchange. And it stays up to date for a few years. Yes it is expensive but who buys cheap, often buys several times! :-) Update 02.02.18 ============= Have the iPhone 8 (times) Plus ;-) now almost two months and my enthusiasm has increased even more! The battery seems to have got even better.The camera is just great. Another reviewer said she was not so good! I can not agree with the best will. Coloring, dynamic range, lens intensity, shutter speed. So extremely good for a smartphone. Had a Galaxy S7, which was (and still is) very good. The 8+ works out details (in JPEG format) in my opinion but even better. In Lowlight, they give nothing. The bokeh effect is better than I would have expected. Partially succeed, with a little routine, great shots. The portrait mode is for me more of a gimmick but quite funny. What the Galaxy ahead of the iPhone, however, is the Pro mode. I wish that too. So Apple, homework machen.Mit my handsfree in the car, the 8+ coupled immediately and the quality is just as good as my old Nokia and now is really a compliment! Crashes or freeze I had not loaded it is very fast. However, I use a 12 watt charger from the iPad. That's about the same as Quickcharge :-) I bought a protective cover from Spigen. Then the iPhone is indeed hidden and stingy with its charms but in case of a fall, it is well secured. And safety comes first, and I now own a Bose Headset QC 20 in Ears with Noise Canceling. Designed for Apple. So that you can use as a phone headset. That was a very good investment. Takes away a lot of noise when traveling by train or plane. Sounds good in music and keeps much better in the ear than the included headset! I will from time to time post new impressions and expand my review! I hope help to the reader in order to können.Update 10/11/18 ============= What can I say that 8+ still runs as Bolle, by iOS 12 even greater smoothness I imagine on. But can really only be imagination. There were no crashes, no problems. It just works. However, I would really like to slowly, the Apple at the camera software nachbessert. A real annoyance when you see your friends handling the Samsung and Huawais of this world. A Pro mode in which I could set ISO, exposure time and the like would be really great and overdue! And why I still can not choose 16: 9 attitude in photos (in the case of videos), almost borders on insolence. Man Apple, now take the wishes of the customers finally seriously? Sure there are third-party software, I would still prefer it if Apple would invest a little more (detail) love in the camera software. Can not be that hard! And one more thing I want to say. The three new iPhones that are already or soon (XR) on the market, have no more Touch ID. Sorry, apple, you lost me. I refuse your overpriced Face ID number. I do not like them, I want Touch ID. Finally come down from your now high horse and offer your loyal fans what they want! Why do not you build in addition Touch ID (eg on the back) and leave me as a customer the choice? You can not be so greedy for money !!! You have already bunkered more than Dagobert Duck ?! ;-) So please, build the 5 Euro part again!
7351	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Space Gray	andy	5	The best is sometimes not good enough, rather too good ...	2018-01-15	de	Sure, the iPhone X is the super thing .... but also the super price! I opted for the 8 Plus, because it is technically almost equal, because it is an iPhone with the underlying Bedienphillosophie ... and because I do not want "showcases", but use it. I put it anyway in a solid protective cover, which applies a few millimeters. It's a good smartphone with super cameras ...

7353	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Benjamin B.	5	Top smartphone with great camera	2018-04-16	de	I opted for this smartphone after a very long time of consideration and eternal comparison on the Internet, as it was the closest match for my requirements. I have to say, although I only had Samsung phones before and this step was hard to get an Apple device, I have not regretted this decision. The habituation went fast and simple. Crucial for me was in comparison to the other smartphones, the performance of the iPhone 8+, which makes the competition in this price range look old by far. It reacts immediately and opens application without delay. The dual camera with 12MP each also says a lot and also makes great pictures and recordings in up to 4K with 60 FPS - that creates no device of the competition and is due to the powerful processor from Apple. The memory version with 64 GB is enough for me completely and will also be sufficient for any normal user who does not want to record 1000 videos in UHD. The quality is very good and the glass optics makes something really good. The fingerprint scanner works reliably and leaves nobody in the cell phone. The cables and accessories are also processed to high quality. The wireless shop, I could not test yet, I have the necessary accessories yet. I can definitely recommend this phone to anyone who firstly wants to get away from the usual Android, second, is on performance and third, who does not feel like over 900 ¬ for to spend the iPhone X want.
7354	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Gary Hobson	5	iPhone remains king	2018-09-01	de	Once iPhone, always iPhone and especially the last of its kind in the proven 16: 9 format! Had some androids tested, all quite failed and after my then 7 Plus now the good 8 Plus. In a jiffy, the backup was uploaded from the cloud, it could not be any better.
7355	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Space Gray	Periklis T.	5	Class iPhone	2019-03-05	de	I ordered the iPhone 8 Plus at o2. I was the iPhone X too expensive and I would rather have the big 8 with a lot of space. The Internet as a result, worth an X anyway only for real Apple fans, because the 8 Plus can keep up. The camera is awesome and the battery lasts a long time. It does not get warm even after playing for a long time! The 7 Plus, however, a colleague was right hot. The home button is also really class with the 3D touch. Can not complain in general! Only a few small but also annoying things are there: - Although it was a new smartphone (not anymore), it has hung here and there times, which is forgivable but should not be with a new device recently I had massive problems with my wifi on the Fritzbox 7490, whereas no other device had something to complain about. Not an iPhone 8 for example. The iPhone 8 Plus my brother in law also had problems. The only thing that helped was an older Fritzbox. The iPhone 8 Plus or generally iPhones are often not so good with Fritzboxen.Ansonsten I can only recommend the smartphone and especially for those who do not want to spend so much money for an X with little memory.

7360	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Hakfin	4	Pure workhorse. I do not understand camera style.	2019-02-27	de	Apple likes to advertise how great the camera is. Unfortunately, I see it differently. In fair daylight the pictures are very good. As soon as you zoom, it gets worse and worse. That's why you can save the telephoto. Portrait mode leaves a lot to be desired. For individuals, the translation of the depth of field is horror. It is also always indicated that I at least or max. 2.5 must / must be removed. If I am, I have to change the camera mode every now and then to shoot the portrait. Why it's so extreme zoom in the portrait mode is a mystery to me. Even if it is just a little bit darker, the pictures contrast and color bar and very rushing. Even fast shots are not quite possible. Shutter speed is just too slow to take a "fast" picture. Portrait mode has two files. This means without the second write file the effect is lost. And not all products such as tablets can read the file. On WIN PC's the pictures are not displayed after recording time. No matter how many times you sort it. In addition, he creates any folders and sorts them free Schnauze.Bilder of PC on the phone only go with the iCloud, which is also very cumbersome. Since it is much easier on Android and goes faster. Furthermore, one may only take Apple products. The phone also indicates sporadically, if you have a "fake" product, otherwise I find the iPhone top, because the software with the device are very well matched.

It came after 2 days so very swiftly I'm due for a praise Turbado ever. I switched from the iPhone SE to the 8 Plus and was not convinced of the size at the beginning. After a maximum of one week I was convinced of the big model. I still can not get the battery out within a day. If you do not want to spend so much money on the iPhone X, it's perfect because it has the same chip and it has almost the same camera. It just does not have the Face ID but Face ID has not convinced me drastically to buy the iPhone X. The iPhone greatly facilitates my everyday life as a student. I am Head Boy and therefore I have to send at least one email a day. Conclusion: The iPhone 8 Plus was the right choice for me, there is nothing to complain about! LG Paul

7380	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Pseudonym	5	Perfect interaction of hardware and software	2017-11-04	de	At first glance I was a bit confused about the iPhone 8 Plus, it looks just like the iPhone 7 Plus. However, when I saw the back, I liked it. The golden version looks the best in my opinion. The color is pretty much what I wanted. The gold iPhone 7 Plus was too yellowish to me, and rose gold was way too pink. The new color, however, is the perfect center. For most, the design seems outdated for me but it looks like the iPhone should look like. A perfected iPhone in the final stage. No ugly antenna strips, no sensitive aluminum and no annoying bending mehr.So should have been the iPhone 6, it would probably synonymous if the developers had more than just a year to develop a new smartphone.Wehalb should be an iPhone 8 Buy Plus? The question is quite simple to answer. If you like Apple's tradition I guess you'll probably prefer the iPhone 8 Plus to the iPhone X. For me, the iPhone X is not a stand-alone device, it's a special edition of the iPhone 8 Plus adapted for Android fans. Apple throws all its convincing overboard just to impress these Samsung fanboys. There is not much difference between the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X. Touch ID becomes Face ID, Animojis are there (more of a gimmick), portrait exposure has both and this very funny Display.Apple stood for minimalism and simplicity, but with the best performance as possible.Therefore, the iPhone 8 Plus has a Darreninsberechtigung.Es provides the latest and best processor on the market, this works perfectly with the operating system together and offers an incredible pace. Everything runs smoothly here, the iPhone 8 Plus does not allow mistakes. The camera is as usual on the highest level, the pictures have an incredible sharpness to the edges and 4K videos with 60FPs are just technical upper class. What another strength of the iPhone is, is the display. This is synonymous if it is only Full HD is sufficiently sharp, the viewing angles are the same as a magazine and the contrast is very natural. Otherwise, one has minimally improved the speakers, wireless charging and fast charging are now included. A smartphone, which has no weaknesses and actually a perfect device is in my opinion definitely a Darseinsberechtigung.Klare buy recommendation on my part, if you do not want the iPhone X you get nothing better than this one.
7381	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Produkt-Tester	4	Many new technical changes. Overall, a good phone :)	2017-09-30	de	The iPhone 8 is the latest smartphone from the house AppleEs is technically good, but something in the shadow of the hijacked iPhone X I have tested the phone for you and this has resulted in ... Design: Visually, the iPhone 8 reminds something to its predecessor even if the back is made of glass and the smartphone has got a surrounding frame made of aluminum. According to Apple, the finish is produced in a seven-layer color process, resulting in a particularly high color depth. Performance: The iPhone 8 Plus has 3Gigabyte RAM and has installed the new A11 Bionic processor, which provides neat performance. An internal controller manages a total of six Kerne, and for the first time a chip integrates an Apple-developed GPU with three cores. While the A10 processor of the previous generation could work a maximum of two cores simultaneously, all cores can be active at the same time on the A11. Camera and photos: With the same megapixel number compared to the predecessor, the photo quality should be better. In addition, the iPhone 8 Plus offers a larger and faster sensor, new color filters and lower pixels. In addition, a new image processor guarantees a faster autofocus, more advanced pixel processing and wider color capture. My conclusion: The iPhone 8 Plus is definitely worth it. Although there are not much changes optically, but technology has taken a big step forward. If you liked this post, it would be useful with ""
7382	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Jörg Bartholome	5	iPhone 8 Plus 64GB in Space Grey!!	2017-09-30	de	Hello! I bought the iPhone 8 Plus 64GB in Space Gray on 27.09.2017! I already had an iPhone 6, 6s, 7 Plus and now the iPhone 8 Plus! What can I say! The best iPhone I've ever had! Top performance, very good camera and battery lasts at least an hour longer than the 7 Plus !! Well clear from the front it looks like the last iPhone! But with the glass behind beautiful view !!! Just a top iPhone !!!
7383	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	DieGrosseKlappe	4	It's worth it this time	2017-11-29	de	With the iPhone 8 Plus you get the highest performance of the finest I had the iPhone 6 128 GB and notice drastic differences in battery life, suppleness and speed etc. the most important question is worth the iPhone 8 Plus course of course if you are an ordinary thing in terms of design want to have access then because it is highly recommended for video players, etc.
7384	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Tina	4	Note on the colors silver and gold	2017-09-27	de	This is not a product review, but a reference to anyone who thinks to order the iPhone 8 online: I have pre-reserved the iPhone 8 via the Apple Store - and sent back immediately after delivery. Reason: I ordered it in silver, like all its predecessors. Silver is only the border, the back is white. If you know it, scroll through the close-ups and look closely, you can see it on the Apple website too. If you do not know it, the back looks silver. The same applies to the color gold. Only the black version probably has a film under the glass back and is therefore black. Maybe you should know that before ordering. Unfortunately, the note is missing from Apple or I have not found it.
7385	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Space Gray	Daniel Brendel	3	Each his own thing	2017-11-26	de	I have been using the iPhone 7Plus for over a year now and I have to say that for me the rise to the iPhone 8Plus was not worth it. The differences between the two Apple phones was just so useless that it was finally thrown out money. Of course, the iPhone 8 is fancier and faster, but the iPhone 7 is still a great phone and the 8th in nothing below. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. My conclusion: who has an older iPhone or even a damaged, for which the Iphoen 8 could be the choice. But rather less for newer users. Since I would rather advise waiting until the iPhone X is cheaper or to wait for the successor.
7386	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Rayrun	3	The change is not worthwhile within 4 years!	2018-02-10	de	If you already have an iPhone 6Plus (from 2014!), Switching to an 8Plus is not really worth it. Unless you find microsecond speed and dimming in the display nice. I can recognize differences only with exact look. Whether the new presentation with the same Retinadisplay or the pictures are better and more beautiful ... is actually a matter of taste. I am 55 years old, wearing brand new glasses and find all pictures and reproductions in the "" old "" IPhone 6Plus "" brighter, more natural and just better !!! All games can be played the same way as on the previous Iphone 6plus. I can see no significant difference and I'm actually disappointed because I've entered a new mobile phone contract, which costs me many euros more now !!! My tip: Stay with the old iPhone for a very long time !!!
7387	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	B.H.	4	++ Simultaneously presented with the iPhone X and then coincidentally better available :) ++	2017-10-08	de	The iPhone 8 has everything except the large EdgeToEdge display and the FaceID feature. Anyone who is currently looking for an iPhone with the latest features such as wireless charging, A11 bionic chip or the TrueTone display, can beat the cheaper brother of the iPhone X confidently. The availability is and was already a short time after market availability on astonishingly good level. If Apple still gets the problem with the flatulence and can fix it, then this is a good successor to the iPhone 7. Everybody has to decide for themselves if the EdgeToEdge-Display and the FaceID-Function are good 400EUR more worth and you should immediately reach for the iPhone X. For me, the jump from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 8 is too low, so I prefer to wait for the iPhone X;)

7389	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Jupiter III	2	Paper tiger for 6S owners	2017-11-12	de	3G, 4, 5, 6 Plus, 6S Plus. The 8 Plus is the first iPhone, the purchase of which I regret and gives me little added value in practice compared to the 6S Plus, on the contrary. This starts with the very nature of a phone calling , Directly after delivery discussions were accompanied by an unpleasant crackle. A later version of iOS brought a workaround by software, yet voices sound much more metallic flatter, unnatural than the iPhone 6S. Something that not only shows on the phone, but also the sound of video recordings. Photos and videos have more dynamics in the evening or dark situations and the white balance is better. In addition, there is 4K recording capability with 60fps and higher frame rate in slow motion. Something that you can only use if you leave the default set more compressed encoding format. Compared to the normal video / image format, it saves a lot of space, but the pictures are muddy, details are lost, so that in sum there is hardly any benefit left. The display is marginally better in comparison to the 6S, but you can see the main difference at night, because the 8 Plus darkens more. In practice, only the iPhone X shows a qualitatively remarkable jump. Also, only on paper one has something of the higher performance. There were no applications for me on the 6S that would have been too slow and those that have jerked on the 6S are also jerking on the 8 Plus. That said, it's the programming of the app, not the performance. Support for wireless charging is certainly an advantage for those who use it. The necessary glass back makes it more sensitive to falls than the metal back of the 6S. Certainly one can argue about what is more aesthetic. If you use a bumper, you can only see the camera slits and tiny differences in the front of the speakers, whether it's a 6, 6S, 7 or 8. Anyway, better water protection is an advantage. I've used all the iPhones in the water so far and could avoid a water damage, but it is certainly not a mistake in case of the cases to be armed. Unfortunately, this water protection is at the expense of the headphone jack. Again, everyone likes to discuss individually who uses them, how much / uses them. In any case, it is one feature less and, in case of necessity, forces an adapter that does not actually improve the sound quality.The battery is smaller than the 6S. Due to the better processor efficiency this should be more than balanced. As far as the final version of iOS 11 is concerned, that is quite a comprehensible statement and even exceeds the runtime of the 6S. However, the thing has a taste. The iOS 11 beta release in early August was the best operating system version ever on the 6S in terms of energy efficiency. Even the optimized iOS 10 versions could not keep up with that. With each new version, the battery life of the 6S was reduced significantly, so that in the official iOS 11 version almost twice as often the 6S had to be loaded than a few weeks before. It's understandable, of course, that Apple is optimizing iOS 11 with a focus on iPhone 8 and X at the end and less on the old models, as I said, it has a connotation anyway. The biggest horse foot of the 8 Plus, however, is the GPS accuracy. In no iPhone / iPad before, the position was often displayed next to the road, even in the open air. It also does not help to reset the factory and switch the locale as it is sometimes generally suggested. I made a few direct comparisons out there with the 6S and iPad Air 2, and in almost all cases it was the 8 Plus that was the largest in Apple Maps' circle of inaccuracy. One point that I will address to the support, however, is found in forums to relatively many comparable entries in which repair and even device replacement have brought nothing and is spoken under the hand of a design problem. However, in terms of open support contact, this point is not included in the rating. What was and is for me personally the most important upgrade reasons is the increased main memory and the 256GB memory space that was not offered on the 6S model. Since this would have been technically possible, and was only offered for economic reasons, I forgive only one star. The higher internal memory speed and thus reduced upgrade / backup time is worth a second star in practice for me. The better water protection would be a star , he would not at the expense of Kopfhörerbuchse.Die slightly better camera is thwarted by the poorer image quality of the compression. One could discuss in total for 3 stars to award, which would probably be fair compared to smartphones from other manufacturers. On the other hand, the benchmark of my rating is the 6S. Purely by feel, the jump from 6S to 8 in practice is smaller than it was the 6S to 6. So I can not give a clear conscience 2 stars for such a smartphone in 2017, for the Apple requires more than 1000 euros. My recommendation to all 6S owners who manage with 128GB is one year to wait for the successor of the X. Since the teething problems are eliminated and you get a real added value for this money.
7390	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Ilyas A.	5	Iphone 8 plus	2017-10-01	de	Perfect mobile I switched from my 6s to the 8 plus am just in love with the phone and the look also very fine with the glass like me super :)
7391	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	3	Top!!!!	2017-10-08	de	I changed from 7 plus to 8 plus. Finally, it has been Apple's turn to install a good camera because I'm traveling a lot and no camera mithabe I think it's important to have a good phone with a great camera! Actually, the 7 plus should be my last iphone since there are never any news with the newer models ... this time I've dared to do it again and say wow apple finally a good camera has the best tests cut off! After the 6s plus had the camera always problems green tones (forest many leaves) to record sharply and that annoyed me so much money spend on a cell phone and the camera only makes beautiful photos in the sunshine! So I bought the samsung s8 plus! I will compare both with each other and test photos! What I'm not so great this time is: much heavier than the predecessor and especially much thicker through the glass although that is so delicate in the fall. Nobody needs that ... ok, fine does not look much more! I'll report after the test again! Update: So the camera is much better than the 7 plus that is true but interior shots without flash are the same as the predecessor! Since samsung makes sharper and better pictures inside, outside both mobiles (samsung and iphone) make good pictures! Fact is: I change back to samsung! Upload a photo as a comparison (cat) so you can see what I mean (probably not so visible on the ipad here)

The camera I would like to highlight! 4k in 60FPS and that is a device in pants pockets format? Even if the price is more than steep, who wants quality, quality and nothing but quality, who has to dig deep into the bag!
7393	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Marvin Singh	3	Superfluous smartphone	2017-10-11	de	I love Apple products, but in my opinion, the iPhone 8 is just superfluous ... My girlfriend has also a contract extension and so I could play around with it a bit and test it. The reasons why I find it superfluous are the following: 1. Of course it has more power and yes, the camera should be better .. But is she? It is almost almost the same which was installed in the iPhone 7. Even the same number of megapixels. Beautiful photos no question, but not much better than the iPhone 7.2. Speed, of course it is stronger in the benchmark than the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 6s. But honestly, IOS runs so smoothly on each of the phones that you can not tell the difference anyway. The price. Why should I get this phone if I get cheaper iPhone 7 or for a 200 ¬ more then the same iPhone X? I do not understand ... 4. Battery pack. The battery is not much stronger than its predecessors. The iPhone 8 lasts only slightly longer than my iPhone 7.Also as I said in my opinion, this cell phone nobody needs .. But that my personal opinion.I hope I could help.
7394	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Stanley	1	The same as iPhone 7	2017-10-09	de	It's just exactly the same as the iPhone 7 only with a slightly better camera but only because no one should spend so much money for such a drecks cell phone
7395	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Scooter08	5	An iPhone 8 Plus for a great price!	2018-01-14	de	Everything went great - shipping was as always fast through Amazon. The iPhone itself was probably imported from Scandinavia. I conclude that from the "instructions", as they were printed in the local languages. The iPhone itself is the same worldwide and therefore no differences to the German version available. The accessories, especially the power plug, of course, also fits easily. The network operators are all supported. In short - everything works as it should and there are no disadvantages. Orginal packed goods from Apple!
7396	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Argent 	Leonhard B.	5	tip iPhone	2018-04-05	de	I have not used iPhone for so long, but it convinced me. The iPhone 8 plus meets my expectations fully. It is frugal and super fast with the usual feel of the middle button (iPhone X does not have these anymore). However, a shortcoming of this product has not been resolved by Apple until today (as is the iPhone X). From a temperature below 7 degrees, it is no longer possible to take pictures outside with flash. The Apple Forum is loudly reported and it is confirmed by all. However, Apple has so far ignored and dismissed with statements like "" does not meet the specification "". I think if all iPhones manage to take pictures at 4 degrees, it should get the iPhone 8 (plus) and the X too. Therefore, only 4 stars but with Apple together. The seller was the super fast and easy.
7397	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Marco	5	Switch from 6S to 8 Plus is worth it	2018-01-12	de	Everything was described in detail by the previous speakers. The device is pretty fast and the photos are brilliant, they are starting to compete with a SLR camera. The device is trimmed on AI, but the practical benefits you have not yet so will change soon. Inductive charging is also great. Touch ID is the change takes some getting used to pressing the button not so deep, but you learn quickly. Overall, the device looks more modern in everyday life.
7398	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	BlauerApfel	5	Top Cell Phone - Top Price	2018-08-21	de	The price of the iPhone 8 Plus is simply top. It costs at least 100 € more in the trade. The delivery took place within a week and there is nothing to complain about. The photos are awesome! Insanity quality, which was the main reason why I chose this phone. The portrait mode is absolutely great. The background blurs easily and the subject is razor-sharp. In addition, there are some features in this mode, such as contour light or black background. The mobile phone is stable, is super fast and the new home button is after a short time getting used to much better than its predecessor. Absolute Buy recommendation for the phone and also from this dealer ,
7399	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Lachsfrischkäse	5	Still very good camera, better than the Xr	2019-04-07	de	Have I brought the 8, because the contract renewal makes the iPhone Xr worse photos, there is something wrong with the white balance. The movies are getting a little better on the Xr, but that's just a touch. The photos are just going very well with the '8', imo still the best photos of all smartphone cameras because the dynamic range is felt to be bigger than others, too And I have definitely received a new iPhone, the bad reviews on this I do not quite understand. You can exchange yes, if it does not fit. Conclusion: who wavers between the Xr, and the 8, I recommend the 8 Series , All the other specs did not really convince me on Xr, and the camera is just worse. Since I take a lot of pictures, that makes a difference to me.
7400	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	BaerBalu	5	Super iPhone, fast delivery .... what more could you ask for?	2019-02-12	de	Everything worked out well for me. The device is new, everything original packed and perfectly fine. I had previously read in the product reviews that some buyers have received used cell phones. That was not the case with me (fortunately), I am very satisfied. And with ordered shell and screen protector - so a total of three items together! I am often dissatisfied with the Amazon's own delivery service lately but here it has worked out exemplary. So here's a big praise in this direction, must be said so synonymous times. For the iPhone itself, I can only say that I have carefully considered whether I take an XR or 8er. The XS is outrageously expensive. But I would like to have the homebutton as well as the fingerprint sensor because I do not want FaceID. And I am very satisfied, everything is running smoothly. And even if the price is not exactly a bargain, it is and remains Apple quality. I can recommend the iPhone 8 Plus.
7401	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Gold	Annette G.	5	Iphone 8 Plus perfect for me	2018-03-30	de	I had an Iphone 6 Plus until a few days ago. Unfortunately, I accidentally but definitively shredded it. The 6Plus I had 3.5 years and would certainly have done a few months his service reliable. Since it was so reliable, I chose the 8Plus for the current successor and am thrilled. It is much faster.
7402	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Argent 	Crasher	5	Technically at the top of smartphones	2017-10-21	de	I've made the change from the iPhone 6 16GB to the iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB because I've lost noticeably in performance and speed. With the 8 Plus you're technically up to date again, the speed is great, the performance and the general tuning just super. Optically, the iPhone 8 has hardly changed its predecessors. The back is now made of glass, which on the one hand is very nice to look at, but on the other hand again a potential weak point and repairs to the glass are the Risiko.Apple used in the iPhone 8 and the 8 plus the A11 Bionic chip, which all other opponents in the Shadow poses. the camera is probably one of the highlights of the new IPhone 8 Plus. It has a 12 MP dual camera and a 7 MP front camera. There is a lot possible here. 4K recordings, portrait mode and live photos are a few keywords. Of course, Touch ID is also on board again, this will not be the case with the iPhone X anymore. For me, this was a reason not to take the iPhone X, but rather the 8 Plus, since I got so used to Touch ID. The battery should according to the manufacturer, similar to the 7 Plus, allow about 21 hours of talk time, up to 13 hours of Internet use, 14 hours of video playback and 60 hours of audio playback. Of course, I have not done these tests in practice, but I can say that the battery lasts all day, I leave the house in the morning at 7, and when I go to bed in the evening at 23 o'clock, I still have between 15% and 25% battery. with the already installed iOS 11, the command center has been reworked, and you can configure it yourself. I see this as a big advantage because I can choose what I need and what I do not. Screen and back are covered with a grease-repellent layer that makes fingerprints less noticeable. Compared to the Galaxy S8 of my girlfriend, I can even confirm this. For me it is a disadvantage that Apple renounces the iPhone 7 and now the 8 on the jack connection. I use my iPhone while driving a car as a navigation device, and I also hear music via the iPhone. With my 6 Series, I was able to connect the AUX cable and charge the device at the same time. This is now only possible via special accessories, for which you also have to spend money again. the quick charge function on the iPhone 8 is also only accessible if you're ready to spend another good 90 ¬ for power supply and charging cable. At the end I would like to say that I do not regret the change to the new generation, because you just notice how old my iPhone 6 became. I am very excited about the speed of the 8 Plus, and it has been well worth it for that alone.

7412	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Mary#1	5	Switch from the iPhone 5S to 8 Plus	2017-11-19	de	Since I had my old iPhone 5s about 4 years in use and the battery performance is more than exhausted, I bought the iPhone 8 Plus just under a month ago. Now I would like to share my experiences with you, maybe they are helpful for one or the other in the purchase decision:) DESIGN: The design is not really different from its predecessors. Only the back is made of glass, so a wireless charging is possible. The smartphone is processed as usual perfectly and is very good in the hand. In addition, the display jumps immediately when you pick it up and I'm really excited about this feature. The camera on the back of the phone is a bit out, which personally but not bother me. The frame is dull but somehow shiny. All in all, the iPhone 8 plus offers a very high-quality impression. The screen is 5.5 inches tall and is also dissolved in FullHD. It offers very nice bright colors and even in direct sunlight, I can read the display still good. PERFORMANCE: In my opinion, the performance of this smartphone can hardly be exceeded. It reacts lightning fast and the reaction speed is really phenomenal. Test results have also shown that Apple hereby offers the fastest mobile phone on the market. This is not only due to the strong Apple A11 processor, but also the excellent balance of hardware and software. With this performance, everything is possible on this phone, I often run several apps at the same time and I have never had problems : The battery life is very good. In a 10h train journey I had the smartphone almost the whole way in operation (have watched series, surfed the Internet etc ...) and even here was the battery is not completely empty. However, I noticed that it actually takes a little longer to recharge (just over 3 hours). Personally, this does not bother me, but I usually charge it overnight. If you do not want to, you can replace the standard Apple battery charger with one that offers more watts. Wireless charging: The iPhone 8 Plus now also offers wireless charging according to the Qi standard. Here I had to wait but 4 hours until my iPhone was fully charged. CAMERA: The concise dual camera is located on the back of the iPhone. It offers 12 megapixels and thus a very good picture quality, which inspires me again and again. The pictures look really high quality and the portrait function was convincing. Objects in the foreground of the picture are even more strongly lifted off the background. (I'll attach different motives, so you can better imagine the quality of the camera.) I was already very excited about the camera with my old 5s iPhone, but this exceeds the quality of the images again by far. The iPhone 8 Plus also offers a slow-motion feature that gives you a slightly different look at things you know. Here, Apple relies on a high full HD resolution with up to 240 frames per second.FAZIT: For some iPhone fans, the new 8 Plus may seem boring, but since I have switched from my 5S directly to this here, I discovered many innovations. iPhone offers hereby a high quality mobile phone in excellent processing with strong battery, excellent performance and excellent camera. The iPhone 8 Plus is undoubtedly a Topsmartphone, but the competition from its own market should be strong. Let's see if I can resist his successor :)
7413	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	■ ■ Mikelomonti ■ ■	4	Great phone with outstanding battery!	2018-11-14	de	In this report I want to talk more about the iPhone 8 Plus. I opted for the 256 GB version. This is what I have done, because 64GB seemed to me to be too small. Since already some things have been said about the smartphone, I limit it to the peculiarities that are relevant to me: components are dealt with in more detail. ■■ Optics ■■ The optics are typically Apple-like. The processing as well. If you hold the phone in your hand, it just feels extremely high quality. It just feels like a piece. And that despite the fact that the combination of aluminum and glass meets each other. The weight is also very pleasant - not too light and not too heavy. The toggle switch and the home button are also perfectly processed. The same applies to the start button. What I also like the look very much, is the camera on the back. This also looks very elegant and completes the overall picture well. I chose the white iPhone myself because I like the contrast between aluminum and glass here. ■■ Modernity ■■ Why the iPhone 8plus and not the iPhone X? I myself am not a fan of the Face ID solution. I myself find the fingerprint sensor just safer and also I'm just not clear about what makes Apple exactly with the pictures of my face. That's a bit too much interference with privacy. No doubt, one has to say that the display of iPhone 8plus is no longer absolutely up to date. If you look at the Samsung Galaxy S8, for example, or even the newer Huawei or the iPhone X, you just realize that these Infinity displays are simply more modern and cooler. They just look fresher. Nevertheless, I am very satisfied with the display of the iPhone 8 +. The contrast is very high and the colors are correspondingly intense. You just have to be clear about what you buy here! ■■ Camera ■■ The camera is just amazing. Pictures are very sharp, very detailed and even the digital zoom makes his work comparatively good.As for the video quality, I would say that the videos of the Samsung Galaxy S8 or S9 are better. But this is my subjective perception and not verifiable on my part due to technical data. Night scenes are also relatively good. For everyday use, this camera is more than adequate. Everyone will really enjoy it here! What I still think is cool is the slow motion mode. Especially in the action area, this can be quite a nice snapshot! ■■ Battery ■■ In my opinion, this is the absolute supreme discipline of the iPhone 8plus !!! Because this battery lasts forever! When not in use, the battery will last for five to six days. If you use the phone more intensively at least two days. Of course you get the battery through in one day. In normal use, he keeps but at least two days loose. And in size, at full resolution and a fairly large display, I find very considerable. I have to load my Samsung Galaxy S8 a lot more often! ■■ Voice Quality & Reception ■■ Here, too, I have noticed an extreme progress. Especially in the rural area, the reception quality and also the reception in general in the iPhone 8plus is much better than in my previous iPhone 7. Here I had much more often no network. Coupling with the hands-free kit in both a VW and Audi works quickly and easily and the voice quality is also very high. Of course, the connection with the Apple earpods is also impeccable! ■■ Overall impression ■■ The iPhone 8plus is an absolute all-rounder for my taste. The screen is big enough, you can even watch videos very pleasantly. The integrated speakers are also very good and loud enough. The picture quality is outstanding and the battery life is also great. A little negative feel the fact that there is no more normal jack connection. This solution over the adapter I'm not so happy. Sure, there are just these wireless solutions, but who has good headphones with cable must just access this adapter. Overall, I still feel Samsung or the Android system as the more modern. Apple and iOS is a bit too dusty from the point of view, so I am giving a star deduction here. All in all, however, I think that one gets a really high quality mobile phone, which leaves nothing to be desired! Whether this is worth the extra price for an iPhone X, I dare to doubt. ■■■■■■■■ If you liked my report or help so I am very happy about a helpful on your part
7414	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Louis G.	1	Only the camera is good	2018-09-19	de	The phone has a good camera but is not special otherwise. It leaves a lot of space next to it and can not compete with Samsung and Huawai mobile phones. I have owned this device for almost a year now and it has become a bit slow. IOS 11 is the worst IOS I've seen so far. It is bended and often crashes the phone. In addition missing important functions, such as: WLAN and Bluetooth can be switched off only on the settings. The phone is too expensive for the performance it brings. I can only advise against it.
7415	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	rallebo	5	impeccable	2017-12-21	de	Is my first Iphone, so have no comparisons to previous models. Great photos, great outfit, great service and for me a super battery characterize the device. Since I already owned an iPad I know myself with the controls. The ICloud makes the interaction between both devices perfect.
7416	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	rotkehlchen	5	Perfect!	2018-07-12	de	Fast delivery - earlier than announced.iPhone 8plus is exactly the description.
7417	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Mehmet Yalcin	4	Super fast and very nice design	2017-12-12	de	I've thought about buying the iPhone 8 Plus. I actually wanted the iPhone X but the wait was too long and I did not want to wait. The iPhone 8 Plus I got through a contract extension at 1 & 1. 24 hours delivery, so it came quickly. Full of anticipation, I have unpacked it and use it now for 3 weeks daily. Design: The front design is exactly the same as its predecessor iPhone 7. However, the back has changed. The back is now made of glass. In my opinion, it looks very noble. Handy: I ​​think the new iPhone is surprisingly good in the hand despite its size. I can even use it easily with one hand. Processor The extremely fast processor A11-Bionic impresses me. The iPhone 8 is currently the fastest smartphone on the market. The question is, of course, if you really need such a processor in everyday life. The predecessor owns an A10 fusion chip. Both processors run about equally well during normal use. Personally, I would also be happy with A10. Camera The camera honestly did not blow me away. It is slightly better than the iPhone 7 Plus. Unfortunately I was disappointed that both cameras (front and back) in bad light, can not take good pictures. At this price you could have expected that. However, I find the portrait mode very good. I hope this will be further developed. Battery The battery is a point with which I am completely satisfied. I come with a recharge, through the day. And I use the smartphone very actively. The battery will certainly not bring the same performance after a year as today. Conclusion: I am currently completely satisfied with the smartphone. The battery keeps great, the design is very nice. The camera could have been better, but it is perfectly adequate for my needs.

7420	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Finchen	5	Iphone 8 plus	2018-01-28	de	Finally, I can write a review here, even if I have not bought the phone here. This will not be a technical review, but there is the datasheet and I think because you know yourself anyway in advance over it. I had the Iphone 7 in Rose before. I already loved that, when I switched from Samsung to IOS. The beginning time was difficult but meanwhile I do not like to miss IOS any more. Since the 7 he was too small for me, I have now switched to the Iphone 8 Plus. First of all, I did not want, because there was no pink in the series of 8 more. However, I find that this golden looks exactly like Pink. Even now after some time I am glad to have decided for the golden version. The edge is as mentioned pink and by the beige back cover in glass it looks really noble. The phone is slightly heavier than the 7 Plus, here I had reservations. But I can completely blur this, after only 1 day I got used to it. Now it seems to me not so big, only if I have a little miss, I still notice the size. The service is great, as usual from IOS. It makes great photos, especially the panorama function, I loved skiing again. Despite its size, it can still be quickly put in your pocket. Super is the stronger battery. While I had to load the 7er every day, I get along with the same use already for 2 days. That's great if I forgot to load it. An absolute top stop for me. I can only recommend it absolutely, I'm glad that I switched from the 7th. Clear buy recommendation from me.
7421	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	MIBESCH	5	The best cell phone I have ever had	2018-12-30	de	I have to say I had only the Samsung s4mini, samsung s5 and the iPhone 6s so far and was curious how the new iPhone will be, I had a few concerns because I had heard that there was little difference to the 6s but where I had the 8 plus and compared it with the 6s I have to say it's just nice differences there: -Kamara is extremely good design with the glass backside being extremely nice-for me the size is also really nice-the phone is just totally fast-the battery lasts longer-the phone is louder-wireless charching (cable charging) i can definitely recommend buying
7422	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Schurl	5	iOS safe and stable	2019-04-26	de	The 8PLUS is very fast with the new chip. It runs without problems. The camera is excellent, you just have to deal with the instructions from Apple, then you get top recordings. The rest, software, operation, processing and speed is really impressive. Have changed 3 years ago from Android because the system after 1 year slower and slower. Apple no problem.
7423	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	5	The best smartphone	2018-02-06	de	The iPhone 8/8 PLUS makes sense especially when upgraded from a 5 or 6 model. I myself had the 6 plus before, with which I was also completely satisfied. But since a contract extension was due, I have deliberately decided for the 8 Plus, and not for the X. The difference from the 6 Plus to the 8 Plus is immense. Thanks to the new A11 processor, the smartphone is brutally fast. A real monster. I've never experienced that at such a speed before. Every application opens almost instantaneously. The camera in the 8 Plus is total madness. Even 3-4 years ago, I would not have thought it possible that a smartphone camera would offer such a quality. The photos are quite worthy of a DSLR camera. The prerequisite is, of course, always that you also know how to deal with a camera. And with the video function you can now synonymous 4K / 60fps recordings, thus the 8 Series models and the iPhone X are currently the only smartphones on the market, with which this is possible. 4K / 60fps recordings are otherwise not even possible with 2000-3000 ¬ expensive SLR cameras. And all that for your pocket. If you had a 6 before, the difference to the 8 is a real quantum leap. And if you like the classic iPhone design with homebutton, touch screen and the well-tried swipe gestures like I do, then the 8 is the only reasonable alternative to the iPhone X, which I find too expensive. Since I'm on the plus models and there is not the X in the Plus version, it comes to me anyway out of the question. The iPhone has come to perfection with the iPhone 8/8 Plus. Never before has everything harmonized so well in an iPhone. Everything runs absolutely smooth, round and smooth and at a rapid pace. With the iPhone X, a new iPhone era begins. The device has many teething problems and is far from mature. On the contrary. For me, the X is almost a trial iPhone, a beta phone and it will be years before it will be as perfect as the 8 Series is now. All of this (and much more) has been the reason for me to choose the 8 Plus. For me personally not only the best iPhone ever, but also the best smartphone ever. A real high-end / tech multi-media machine of the finest quality.
7424	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Pete53797	5	very good smartphone, great workmanship, best operating system IOS, super fast, optimal size, just Apple	2017-12-03	de	The iPhone8 plus has met exactly my expectation. Price performance is right, the device has the usual Apple quality, super fast and user-friendly with the latest IOS 11, great features, cloud-based data exchange with other Apple devices are just unique.

And it has so far not a single scratch the phone is running perfectly, it is fast, battery top, picture quality top! Do not regret a penny (909 €). Will certainly last the next few years without any problems, and in the end you can even sell it well.
7426	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	M.B.	5	Once Apple always Apple	2018-01-09	de	Had a 6 plus before. So far completely satisfied. More memory was important to me. I'm looking forward to the made photos if the camera is really better. Unfortunately there is no big difference to the 6er visually. Otherwise Apple stop
7427	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Hildegard Kerber	5	iPhone 8 Plus	2018-02-12	de	I am already over 60 and smartphone entry-level. I looked at different models. Since we have a MacBook Pro and my wife has the same model, I decided to do it. A small drawback is the high price.
7428	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Crasher	5	Technically at the top of smartphones	2017-10-29	de	I've made the change from the iPhone 6 16GB to the iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB because I've lost noticeably in performance and speed. With the 8 Plus you're technically up to date again, the speed is great, the performance and the general tuning just super. Optically, the iPhone 8 has hardly changed its predecessors. The back is now made of glass, which on the one hand is very nice to look at, but on the other hand again a potential weak point and repairs to the glass are the Risiko.Apple used in the iPhone 8 and the 8 plus the A11 Bionic chip, which all other opponents in the Shadow poses. the camera is probably one of the highlights of the new IPhone 8 Plus. It has a 12 MP dual camera and a 7 MP front camera. There is a lot possible here. 4K recordings, portrait mode and live photos are a few keywords. Of course, Touch ID is also on board again, this will not be the case with the iPhone X anymore. For me, this was a reason not to take the iPhone X, but rather the 8 Plus, since I got so used to Touch ID. The battery should according to the manufacturer, similar to the 7 Plus, allow about 21 hours of talk time, up to 13 hours of Internet use, 14 hours of video playback and 60 hours of audio playback. Of course, I have not done these tests in practice, but I can say that the battery lasts all day, I leave the house in the morning at 7, and when I go to bed in the evening at 23 o'clock, I still have between 15% and 25% battery. with the already installed iOS 11, the command center has been reworked, and you can configure it yourself. I see this as a big advantage because I can choose what I need and what I do not. Screen and back are covered with a grease-repellent layer that makes fingerprints less noticeable. Compared to the Galaxy S8 of my girlfriend, I can even confirm this. For me it is a disadvantage that Apple renounces the iPhone 7 and now the 8 on the jack connection. I use my iPhone while driving a car as a navigation device, and I also hear music via the iPhone. With my 6 Series, I was able to connect the AUX cable and charge the device at the same time. This is now only possible via special accessories, for which you also have to spend money again. the quick charge function on the iPhone 8 is also only accessible if you're ready to spend another good 90 ¬ for power supply and charging cable. At the end I would like to say that I do not regret the change to the new generation, because you just notice how old my iPhone 6 became. I am very excited about the speed of the 8 Plus, and it has been well worth it for that alone.
7429	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Seryoga	5	The perfection	2017-10-26	de	The iPhone is the perfection of the previous models. The workmanship, the glass back it fits everything. Battery keeps me 2.Days and I use the iPhone quite often for social media, YouTube, etc. And typical IOS is, it runs and runs and, above all, runs smoothly. The camera is great and the pictures have a realistic color representation, which is not the case with many other smartphones. I can only recommend the iPhone.

7431	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	S.K.W.	5	Recommended!	2017-12-10	de	The iPhone 8 Plus is a top device. I've owned Samsung smartphones for many years, including the latest ones like S7 Edge, S8, S8Plus, Note 8 ... I've tested all of them and in the meantime for a few months iPhone models (6s Plus, 7 Plus). After me the Note 8 had now extensively tested, I have found for me that the Samsung Time has expired once for me. Not least because of the bad battery life of the note 8. For the price unacceptable. I was convinced u. a. the iPhone 8 Plus the design (yes, it looks like its predecessor, but that's exactly what I think is great). The quality is perfect! Soft- and hardware ... are perfectly matched, this is also noticeable in the battery life While the note 8 with moderate use and a bit of luck managed a day, my iPhone keeps very loose 2 days ... It inspires me every time again! Camera The camera is great! Currently one of the best smartphone cameras you can get in the market. The thing is really fun! What I've noticed very clearly: Your iPhone is really an honest smartphone. While me in selfie shots a Note 8 from Samsung has always hammered such a nice blur in the face, so yes all tippi toppi looks like, no wrinkles, no dark circles (not even after a 10 hour party or stressful 50-hour week ) my iPhone is quite different. After shooting the first few selfies, I was horrified. No blur - just the brutal reality. For some selfies, I briefly considered whether I should really leave the apartment. That's sometimes a bit hard ... But let's face it, who wants to be fooled around on the other side? My iPhone has clearly taught me to think carefully before, if I'm mentally able to, now really a Make selfie. It could happen that my good mood is shredded within a second. Charging the battery takes 2-3 hours, but that does not bother me. Who wants to get a quick charge cable? Buy device, the 8 Plus and the iPhone X support Qi and inductive charging. The points that should have a smartphone for me, are all given here. And in a super quality and technical Ausstattung.SpeicherIch have the 64 GB version, which is absolutely sufficient for me. I currently have about 60 apps, 600 pictures, a few videos, about 25 hours of music, offline navigation .... and just about 14 GB consumed ... But who films a lot, plays many games and everything else on the mobile carries with it should possibly to the large 256 GB version griff.FAZIT: Clear Buy recommendation!
7432	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Thomas K.	5	Iphone 8Plus and Iphone X: A Comparison	2018-02-12	de	I bought the Iphone 8Plus after having to hand over the Iphone X again. So I will not talk about the Iphone 8Plus, but explain the differences between the 5.5 "and 5.8". It's a great smartphone Compact in the hand, is very clean processed, offers according to Apple a 5.8 "large screen, of which one, however, due to the screen format only when reading websites has a greater advantage over the 16: 9 screens! Watch videos like Youtube on, the X is not the first choice. The Iphone X is unlocked by Face ID, which usually works smoothly. In addition, both rear cameras are equipped with an optical image stabilizer, so overall a top mobile phone with small weaknesses when viewing videos (hardly larger than the 4.7-inch model). Why have I now exchanged the X for the Iphone 8 Plus? The reason is the following: The Iphone X has caused me head and eye pain! As I researched more closely, I came to the following answer: It is partly due to the OLED - display, which works with a kind of pulse width modulation to darken the display and the relatively slow oscillations (240HZ) can lead to eye and headaches, and the other is Face-ID (attention checking), which regularly emits UV rays. The incredible thing is that I do not seem to be the only one with this problem, just give it "Eyestrain with Iphone X" at Google and will be amazed that the Iphone X causes many users problems. All these factors have me almost to 8 Plus which offers an almost equally good camera, has the faster and more reliable Touch ID button and is able to display 16: 9 content on the entire display. I owned it before (without X) the Iphone 6S Plus and can also say In total, the Iphone X gets 1 star from me because it is harmful to my health (flickering, UV rays) and the Iphone 8 Plus 5 stars, even if it is not so compact.
7433	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Jakob H.	4	More than expected!	2017-10-31	de	Finally it's the Iphone 8! In the beginning I was totally disappointed because I thought that hardly anything had changed but these were just prejudices. After a 2-week test, I can give good 4-star and now I want to tell why: First of all, I would like to list both advantages and disadvantages (I'm sorry if I forget any point): BENEFITS-We finally have one Protection against water and dust-The best processor at the moment, A11 Bionic, was installed here and this impresses me again and again! -There is a new so-called Truetone technology glass is now used instead of aluminum which feels much higher quality- Finally wireless charging! Thanks Apple:) - Augmented-Reality-Improved cameras work on a very high level-New colorMore advantages than initially thought and I personally personally only 3 disadvantages einDas Iphone 8 I can recommend to anyone who spends a lot of time on the phone since the A11 Bionic delivers the best performance. Everything ran smoothly for me and it never got jammed. The new Iphone can be quite happy makes Samsung finally competition again :)

7435	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Sebastian G.	5	Nice upgrade and super high-end smartphone with unbelievably good camera	2017-10-10	de	I switched from the iPhone 6S Plus to the 8 Plus and do not regret it in any way. Yes, almost 1000 € are a lot of money for a smartphone, but you also get a lot for your money ... if you know what you want! In my household are various Apple devices, such as MacBooks, an iMac, an Apple TV and various airplay-enabled speakers and an Apple Watch and hi-fi components. What you have to leave Apple - the connection to a given infrastructure in the "" Apple Cosmos "" is terrific, iCloud for me is always the "" killer feature "" because data exchanged very quickly and documents from one device to another first-class Yes, the display design is "" stale "", but thanks to the display edges you still have something to "hold on" to and look (for example, while looking a Youtube video) is not covered by the fingers (as it is the case with the Galaxy S8 / Note 8). 1080p are also perfect. The workmanship is typically Apple-typical and the glass back feels terrific. Wireless charging also works with Case. The speed of the iPhone 8 is just brutal. This is undoubtedly the currently fastest processor in a cell phone, no matter whether photo editing, games, multitasking - everything runs easy. The first impression of the camera is breathtaking, but it could test only a short time and only a few "" test shots "" make. In this regard, I will attach some sample images of the camera. Now a highly recommended smartphone for the buyer, who knows what he wants. I would buy it again and can recommend it without hesitation.

Previously had the 6s Plus, which was still a top smartphone, but me the camera of the 8 Plus, the chip and all the benefits that there has been since the 7 Plus, enticed.Have also considered the iPhone X to buy, but here I have the even more expensive price, the omission of the Touch ID and also the rare scarcity an argument against the purchase been. The 8 Plus at least does what it should. The display with True Tone I find just super natural of the colors and very sharp, the camera is one of the best smartphone cameras on the market and the benchmark atomized anyway any Android Phone. The processing is first class as usual. Especially the new glass back is terrific. Battery life for me much better to my old. Some describe the design as stale. It may be, but I call it classic and I like it very much. But in 2 years at the latest, I'll probably say goodbye. Until then, I can only fully recommend the 8 Plus.

The camera performance with the effects is sensational and the display, the graphics and the colors are really terrific. Also the sound is a lot better. The battery has been massively improved, but of course it is still better The apps and the menu is running like sliced ​​bread.The operation is as easy as any iPhone so it is also suitable for seniors or people who do not care much with high tec!

Pro-no dual camera (except 8 +) - Average contrast - no quick-charge power adapter included in delivery - shorter than the iPhone 7 - 3.5mm Rifle as with the iPhone 71. Design and Display: - Same display sizes - slightly higher contrast ratio - True Tone Display (more natural colors) 2. Camera- 12 Megapixel Resolution- 7 Megapixel Selfie Camera- Because of the A11 chip, movements, lighting conditions and faces are detected and adjusted before shooting- iPhone 8 has no dual camera- iPhone 8+ has dual camera (so for photofreaks it's best to select the +);) - Movies are possible in 4k mode, but slow motion only in Full HD3. Processor or benchmarks, speaker A11 chip 25% louder speakers than the predecessor faster than the iPhone 7 (twice as fast as the Smasung Galaxy S8) 4. Battery and battery life 1821 milliamp hours Battery (predecessor had 1960) - Battery life is not drastically reduced, but a little wireless loadable possible, but only with charging station !!!! not included in the iPhone itself! (but costs only 70-90 €) - with Lightning cable, however, it loads faster than over induction I hope you liked the review and I could advise you a little on your purchase. Conclusion: The upgrade from 7 to 8 is worth it in my opinion Not. Of 5 or 6, however, it makes sense if the money is available, of course.
7444	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Sportydriver	4	My first iPhone and only trouble	2017-10-25	de	After being an Android user for many years, I decided to give Apple a try because I did not want Android on the "" crafting system "". In the hope of a stable, mature operating system along with the iPhone 8 Plus, I'm rather disappointed after a week. Sure, iOS has some advantages, such as fast apps. I did not know anything like that before. On the Internet in no time, there is really joy auf.Aber unfortunately, there are still many construction sites, which are largely due to a very poor operating system: - Even recorded photos (no live images) are in a folder with WhatsApp images, etc. in one Folders are packed and can not be stored separately in a separate folder. A separate folder for portraits, for live images and even one for WhatsApp. Only the "" normal "" images come in a collection folder. What a nonsense !!! - Image information of recordings, such as creation date and time does not exist. Only if one loads the pictures on the PC, one can call this information. - Which I also instead, my email accounts can not be updated regularly with the email app. I can do what I want. It does not work. Only another email app helped. Apple! - Today tried to pull pictures from the iPhone to the Windows PC. The copying by explorer still worked. But then I noticed that the images are saved in a format called HEIC and can not be opened with anything. So called the hotline and first bumped into perplexity. HEIC said nothing to the employee. After a long wait the solution was found. There is a setting where you can change the whole thing so that JPEG are saved. What a drama! - Sending and receiving images via Bluetooth is of course not possible. Now some will scream again that you know something like that before and you can inform yourself. I did not know and thought 2017 is something as natural as Android has been possible for many, many years.- If you go under settings - battery then you jump somehow constantly while scrolling back and forth. You can then choose between consumption of the last 24 hours and 3, 4 or 5 days what appears there to choose is apparently a matter of luck. Time is 3 days, times 5, times 4. What is this nonsense? - Connect to iTunes? No problem, but apart from advertising, advertising and advertising again, it seems to be completely pointless. I've spent 2 days trying to load images into any clouds and automatically sync them. I'm too stupid for that or I'm smart. Unlocking iTouch works very well, except for the fact that you sporadically land on the lock screen and I'm told to press the button again. 10 times the home screen opens directly and then again, although the device was unlocked. It's annoying - well, then at least it will work with navigation. So today on the way the Navi started by Siri and entered destination. Wonderful, the Navi starts its service and shows me the route. But something is missing. Right, no speech! No matter what I tried, it was silent. Certainly, the phone is smarter than me here.- Two times it has already happened that I could unlock the phone on an incoming message, which was seen as a banner on the lock screen, by simply wiping the banner to the right. No Touch ID required !!! If you call Android as a craft OS, should try out the new iPhone 8 Plus. Update 01.11.2017einige problems have done in the meantime.- So the email accounts now work without problems.- image information is actually displayed (sorry , my mistake) .- Touch ID works now also, thanks to an additional setting (hidden in the menu) reliable.- the iCloud works after a long time back and forth, now also remain so far the strange photo folder, where all pictures land and one is forced Moving your own recordings into separate albums and the lack of ability to send / receive files like photos via Bluetooth (to Android) Therefore now 4 instead of 3 stars.
7445	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Gray	Rob	2	Samsung stood 2 years ago	2017-10-03	de	I already had a 5s in front of the iphone 8 and finally an S6 edge. I'm bothered by the Iphone8's low-resolution display in contrast to the S6. Furthermore, the camera can not handle RAW, and you always have to make do with the images calculated by Apple. The S6 is not an issue that makes dng files + jpg. Wireless loading is in most Android devices for years no issue ..... I give a completely overvalued mobile phone back and will be back for the time being my S6.

7447	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Amazon Customer	5	Super iPhone 8 Plus	2019-07-11	de	I deliberately bought the iPhone 8 Plus because I like the home button better than FaceID of the iPhone XS or XR. I like the size very much.
7448	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Nadine Laabs	1	SCAM! No new product! Warranty expired!	2018-09-15	de	Attention FRAUD! Seller: TI-Trade, purchase June 2018Ware was delivered quickly, 1. Delivery was defective from the outset, exchange was smooth. The second iPhone, which was delivered seemed to be in commissioning once in order. After four weeks of use, however, showed a defect in the microphone, caller could not understand me despite good cell phone reception suddenly; When playing back videos recorded with the front camera, you could hear noise. I've come to an Apple retailer to claim the 12-month warranty that's usually available on new equipment from the first activation. Based on the serial number was first checked whether the device is still eligible for warranty and to my horror was found that this had already expired. The device was already over 1 1/2 years old, so had no claim to warranty, but was welded sold as new. That's cheating! So I reset the device to factory settings, returned it and demanded my money back. It took a long time until the return was processed despite repeated requests, then the seller said, I did not disable the "iPhone Search" feature and he would now need my Apple ID and password. Haha! Luckily that could be done from a distance (without giving any passwords) and now, after three months back and forth, I finally got my money back. The whole thing has cost me a lot of time and nerves, countless e-mails had to be written and I did not get my money for three months (almost 500 €). I can only warn against a purchase!
7449	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Marina	1	Attention cheaters!	2018-10-23	de	The dealer TI-Trade are cheaters! The newly acquired with iPhone 7 was already two years old and needed. When I got the iPhone, I had it analyzed on the same day at Apple. It was found that the cell phone was used for the first time two years ago and was reset in March 2018. Thus, of course, the warranty has already expired and it is therefore not new. In addition, was missing in the packaging, which was rewelded incidentally, the adapter from Lightning to Aux. The service of TI-Trade was very bad. No one was available by telephone and I got the money only 5 days after the two-week deadline.
7450	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	andrea hocke	1	The phone is not new	2018-11-24	de	Purchased cell phone in june. Nothing works now. Apple says the phone was bought in 2016 in the UK, so no warranty anymore. The battery was already exchanged before the purchase. That was a flop. Many Thanks!
7451	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Sebastian Fricke	1	! ! ! Attention ! ! !	2019-01-06	de	Attention, scams! No new! Have got a used device! Various scratches, Zergrabbeltes and discolored charger, geknautschte OVP.Der battery does not hold what he should. Here you are pulled over the table!
7452	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Fiona Habichler	5	Very good product	2019-02-18	de	The product arrived even before the delivery date! The Iphone 7 was ORIGINAL packed including everything that belongs to it, welded in and also the check of the serial number showed that it is NEW! Works super fast without any mistakes! Battery capacity 100%! I am satisfied from the ground up!
7453	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	5	Price performance top	2018-08-25	de	Although no Apple warranty more on it but much cheaper than Apple. Was originally packed with all accessories. Generally a very good phone with good battery life and has almost all the features like the 8 Series.
7454	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Vincent	5	Right top	2019-01-14	de	I wanted a modern iPhone without overpriced mega price. This is a great smartphone which I especially like the size. It's not clunky at all and disappears nicely in my pocket. Still has a nice big screen. Just the right format.Bin very happy about it.
7455	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	K.Pol	3	Device defective after 1.5 years	2019-03-06	de	After 1.5 years, the device no longer reacts to touch - even the middle button remains without function. Commissioning is only possible after a reboot - several times a day. After a complaint, the dealer referred me to the warranty of 12 months. A warranty of 24 months has been rejected1. from the dealer - because outside of Germany2. Apple - because on the bill no serial number was specified. Attempts to get a bill with serial number were unsuccessful. My conclusion: in a device for over 700 euros a dubious performance - both in technology and in customer service dealer / manufacturer
7456	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Lorenz	4	works perfectly	2019-05-06	de	After my switch from Iphone 6s I was absolutely thrilled. After some time, I noticed that the battery life of the Iphone 7 is much weaker than the 6s. Everyone should decide for themselves what is more important to them. I am absolutely satisfied except for the battery with the Iphone 7.
7457	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	1	The brightness of the iPhone is funny	2019-06-07	de	Have the phone now for a while and have recently noticed that the brightness and color of my screen is a bit strange after I compared it with the iPhone 6 of a friend. Her screen was much brighter and whiter, and mine was darker and yellowish. Maybe it's a fake or a fake or just a production mistake, do not know. Except for that, but with the phone everything is fine. But would still recommend anyone who wants to buy an iPhone to buy it in a trustworthy business and I will do it in the future.
7458	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Anne Jürgens-Becker	1	Scam!	2019-05-05	de	Scam! - I welded the iPhone 7 at the end of June 2018 and got it sold as new. Because of long-standing problems with the battery, which finally aufquoll, this had - to save the iPhone - quickly replaced on 04.05.19. When opening the phone was clearly stated that the battery has already been replaced and not new. About the serial number could be determined that for this iPhone the warranty period had already expired.
7459	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Kalla243	4	Technically perfect but ITunes is a disaster .....	2019-05-31	de	The phone is really beyond doubt, the feel and look are great, there are thousands of apps you need and much more no Schw .... needs. But ITunes for the traffic needs nobody, is cumbersome and just extremely annoying. In short .... Only for people who never want to save their data and never want to live outside of the Apple world (Sorry son man :-) For it would actually give 3 star deduction, but realistic and considered for the majority of humanity is a Star deduction okay.

It had some dents in it already when I got it which wasn’t the end of the world. But then after a few months the phone randomly overheated and the camera and flashlight stopped working. I tried to return or exchange it which they were willing to do but now it has been over two months since I sent the phone back and I haven’t received a fixed phone or my money back. Now I’m out a phone and a few hundred Euros! Avoid these guys!

My daughter was already a few weeks ago at the Apple Store in Munich, they have looked at the phone, but unfortunately could not fix it. That can happen. What I do not accept is that RH Mobiles does not respond to the mails I sent you on July 5th and July 18th, although it says you will be in touch within 48 hours. The next smartphone I will not refer to Amazon. Hermann Probst

I could easily check this by the serial number. Allegedly an oversight of TI-Trade; In my opinion, a nasty scam, because it was really very original wrapped turned - at this point I would like to pronounce a fraud warning.
7530	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Lina B.	1	Scam!!!	2018-08-16	de	I got my supposedly new iPhone 7 today, but it's not new.

7532	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	CK	5	Original Iphone 7	2018-06-01	de	I bought the iPhone 7 because my HTC one M8 broke. I am very satisfied with my iPhone. The workmanship is high quality, the picture quality is very good, the camera is synonymous really great. I have intentionally bought the iPhone 7 and not the iPhone 8, since it is the last model with a metal back cover (IPhone 8 back cover -> glass). The computing power is also not significantly worse for the new model. Clear buy recommendation for the iPhone 7, because you can still save a lot here in return for the iPhone 8, without added value.

7535	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	C. P.	1	Used iPhone 7	2018-08-13	de	I bought an iPhone 7 for a really good price. It was packed as original as my friend's iPhone X. First, it made me suspicious that on the back only the iPhoen data in English was specified. After opening, I much to the 3.5mm jack adapter was missing and to make sure that it is really a new iPhoen I have checked the serial number. Then came the evil surprise! On the iPhone, the 90-day phone support had already expired! -> So no new smartphone as declared, but used! Contact with TI-Trade recorded, the return was approved very quickly! After that it was quiet! It followed no email to inquiries, etc. Only when I contacted Amazon I was promptly answered and then finally the costs Rückerstattet.Ich that's a right scam of those, the ignorant to turn a used iPhone and then do not respond to any contact! DO NOT buy from TI-TRADE -> used goods !!!!!!!

The display had some small scratches in the upper left corner, but it was not visible when the protective film was applied. Update: After the iPhone only worked for about 6 months, it was taken back by the MultiSpotStore because of the guarantee and replaced by a replacement device. That's positive! Only the replacement device is scratched and the battery status is 80%, a charge holds only about 6 hours. The first device was over 90%!

At first the phone was still flawless, but the appearance is deceptive! Apple iPhone 7 Smartphone (11.9 cm (4.7 inches), 32GB internal memory, iOS 10) matte black

Since the article is needed, you have to expect one or the other Macke or scratches, inasmuch as the condition of the phone is acceptable. From the technical side, I could not find any defects so far, everything does as it should. Touchscreen, fingerprint scanner, loudspeaker, everything is working properly. If I fall again a cell phone in the toilet, I will definitely buy my next here again! A small note: the adapter for lightning to aux was missing in the delivery. I do not need him and I do not even know if he should have been there. But maybe an important info for another customer.
7543	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	1	Vendor flop, Amazon top	2018-07-19	de	I ordered the iPhone 7 last November and was very satisfied at first, until I took the first pictures. I noticed that the camera often could not fix properly and the image quality was pretty much for the A ****. It was very strange to me, just because Apple is known to have a good image quality. Nevertheless, I was able to live with it. Exactly 6 months later, however, my reservations were confirmed, the iPhone was out, despite loading it could not be switched on anymore and I must add that I treated the mobile phone like in cotton wool (was not exactly that either not much I paid for it). It never fell off, did not get wet and I tried to load it as seldom as possible. I immediately contacted the vendor and unfortunately I just got a standard message in reply, which really disappointed me. Luckily I did not throw in the towel right away and turned to amazon directly. I have to say, Amazon sent me a return slip immediately after my message (without any shipping costs), with the statement I get the full money back , Except for a longer wait and a short response from my side, everything ran smoothly afterwards and I got my money back. Thanks again to the customer service of Amazon, you can really rely on it! The direct provider, however, is more likely to be one Flop .. the Apple devices do not seem to be 100% original and not high quality either.

7566	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Gustav Ganz	2	New not new	2018-05-18	de	I ordered a new iPhone 7. Shipping went very fast and it was there after 2 days. Only when unpacking came the first doubt because the protective film was pretty dirty. Have then entered the serial number at Apple and found that the 1 year warranty had already expired. Thus, it was not a new device as stated but probably only to an already returned and re-sold iPhone. Otherwise, the iPhone worked quite well. By iOS11 could only see that the battery was already at 90% wear. IPhone went back for the simple reason that it was not new.

7570	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	M.K.	2	not the best phone I've ever had	2017-09-30	de	After years of using Samsung, I took the step in the direction of Apple and regret it in several points. Very poor reception no matter wlan, mobile data or normal Telefonienetz.Ich I switched from a Samsung S5 on the Iphone 7 and had directly bad reception. It did not get any better after replacing the sim card. With further searches on the Internet turned out that many people have the problem. What brings me a cell phone where the basic functions do not work? Optical and the operation really top but I live half in the country half in the city and have problems the network problems ( which I did not have before with the S5) Especially with a over 600 ¬ Handy the basic characteristics should work but unfortunately you do not. I'm disappointed and pretty annoyed.
7571	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	5	Hammer part !!!!	2017-07-09	de	So with me everything went as planned and previously said regarding delivery etc., although a bit long with 5 days of delivery but well known is the anticipation is the most beautiful ;-) Everything as it should be, the 7 was completely new welded and inside in the package, in terms of some recessions are where the iPhone was missing! I have to say that I have between the iPhone 6s I once dared to the other side and I got the Samsung S8! Phew yeah what should I say for me, Apple ever Apple !! I notice again, how great the system and processing around the device works is the hammer, because Samsung or any other manufacturer in my opinion, never and never keep up! Battery has been improved a lot to 6s, camera, and I find 3D Touch also very useful! Speed ​​of the apps and everything around it anyway (top) !!!! ...... One of the most important things was that the fingerprint sits back in front! That's a disaster at the S8 up there next to the camera. And besides, I could not cope with the aspect ratio at all !!! So what you get out of my recession is that I'm extremely excited about iPhone 7 and "" for me "" is the best smartphone on the market !! But that's everyone's taste and how he likes to handle it! Aja the dealer was from Topprice 24, if I have written him correctly now! ;-) came from Madrid the device-so 5 days delivery !! But everything completely new, so from me nothing to complain about !!! Lg ;-)

7574	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	GerdBL	5	Used bought Apple iPhone 7 smartphone	2017-10-13	de	Buy Used "" Apple iPhone 7 Smartphone "". Can I only recommend, because at amazon good providers with service and warranty minimize the risk for a used device. Processing and delivery optimal. A small note about the "" Apple iPhone 7 Smartphone (11.9 cm (4.7 inches), 128GB of internal memory, iOS 10) matte black "". As an Apple user, I have gained my experience with iPhone 4, 5 and SE. After the SE as last development, after the 7er, I still chose the 7 as described. Pleasant is the larger display. All other innovations are well communicated. Whether progress or disadvantage ultimately has to be decided by the user. The handling through the rounded edge of the case takes a bit of getting used to, but users of the 6 Series have become accustomed to it. I find two things disturbing. Once the location of the home button right side in the upper area, is often disturbing in the photo function. Second, the omission of the 3.5 mm jack for the headphones appears to be a problem at the beginning. But the Apple original headphones with Lightning connector instead of the latch actuator, simply solves the problem. However, if the AUX function for other purposes wireless is not sufficient, has invested in an adapter. After iPad, MacBook, iMac and Co. is for me personally wireless announced.
7575	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	jonnyisgood	5	Product rating, NOT seller rating	2019-04-05	de	You have to give the sellers bad reviews, not the product. The iPhone itself is not scrap, just because you wanted to make a special bargain and fell for it. A particularly cheap price and an unknown seller is there but a good indication. The Rolex from the beach certainly has no guarantee.
7576	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Anonym	5	Great phone from Apple	2017-06-26	de	Super quality as used by Apple. I think the camera of the iPhone 7 is particularly great, the pictures are beautiful. Also, I am thrilled, as always! Clear Buy recommendation.
7577	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	SkyObe	2	Price not justified!	2019-06-09	de	The iPhone 3GS I had every model to the iPhone 7, this has now changed. The iPhone 7 is anything but a flagship, the integrated and non-expandable memory is heavily strained by APPLE's IOS, the more demanding will play Phone extremely warm, the Bluetoth quality reaches just mediocre. The camera is in comparison to other devices pure mediocrity and from the IPS 68 certification of the iPhone 7, Apple itself does not seem quite convinced (or why else the warranty committee?) My iPhone 7 (including the devices from my circle of acquaintances) were noticeable slower in the course of the last 7-10 months. About 5 months ago, I own a Nokia 8, which dominates the iPhone 7 in really all areas and only the half costs. Unfortunately no purchase Recommendation for Apple and the Iphone 7!
7578	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Fireball3	1	After a year sudden device dead	2018-09-14	de	About a year ago I bought my wife an iphone 7 with 128GB. The said mobile phone looks through the careful use until today as new. Nonetheless, the phone suddenly became boiling hot (source of danger) and has stopped working since then. The warranty expired a few weeks ago - and goodwill is a foreign word at Apple. For a mobile phone that only lasts for one year and is almost injured, the price is in no way justified. We will turn our backs on Apple after this experience and get a device with better value for money - prestige is not everything in life! However, until the said day, the mobile phone has worked well, albeit no better than comparable competing products.
7579	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	TD_63	4	Top device!	2017-06-28	de	Perfect balance between size and weight. I use it professionally and privately - it just works. The difference between the Iphone 6 and the Iphone 7 is not really big and therefore considering the high price, is not a big upgrade. Therefore from me only 4 stars. But still it is a top device!
7580	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	1	I'm not satisfied with the order	2018-06-14	de	This device was sold as new, however, it is not new. It lacked the detailed German manual. It lacked the Apple stickers, which are to be obtained with each new iPhone. The charger is not new. You can see the dirt under the foil. In addition, the charger does not look original, Above all, you notice it on the edge of the store device.
7581	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Benjamin	5	Clear recommendation	2017-12-23	de	Was better than described. There were even headphones and everything was like new. There was only a small mini scratch on the display, but in the condition Acceptable I would have imagined it much worse. I would recommend again and again
7582	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	4	Unfortunately, no German version received	2017-06-13	de	The iPhone works perfectly and has been absolutely new. However, the enclosed instructions and the packaging indicate a version from Eastern Europe. For me these were not readable. This could have given Amazon quiet before.
7583	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Haribopferdle	4	I can not complain	2018-01-20	de	I had previously received the iPhone 5s and now this for my birthday. Yes, what is new? Actually, not too much at first glance - first of all the size and the other homebutton and the better camera. The battery lasts much longer (at the beginning they do it all, in 1-2 years it counts) and it has a really good feel. I must first get used to it, that I do not come with the thumb so easily to the top left (back) but that's simply because of the size. As far as I am, I'm very satisfied with Apple. Just sim into the new phone and it will take everything - flawless.
7584	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Liza Kuthe	4	Seller keeps what he promises	2017-11-20	de	The delivery was faster than expected! The phone has a small scratch on one side. But you really only see him when you look very carefully. It does not bother me at all! All in all, great. I'm very satisfied!

7587	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Nopogo1960	5	Smart!	2018-08-01	de	After my IP6 is now 3 years old, it was time for something new used. The 16 GB memory reached its limits. After all, I am convinced of Apple. The IP7 with 128GB memory is faster and delivers better pictures than the 6er. For my use the right decision. Me (58) Electrician is still working and does not always have to be "on". The battery lasts for three days. At night and in the office on power-saving mode, it works. Nice toy for technology lovers. Since yesterday I have learned that you can also call it. That should have gone with the IP6 already? In that sense, the Nokia 3210 can finally retire, ahead of me! ;-)
7588	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Patrick	4	May I introduce: The iPhone 7	2018-08-10	de	May I introduce: The iPhone 7.Jo, an iPhone just. No here should not come any of these reviews, the first basically on the company Apple and the exorbitant price draws to end up with the fact that we are all slaves of capitalism. No, what I want to go out in particular is the difference to the iPhone 6 And the difference between these two models is, well, let's just say it's not groundbreaking: Optics / Color: Yes, the 7's are more colorful now, if you like. This fact will surely be noticed by everyone. Whether this is more beautiful, hip or innovative is sometimes put there. This is not important to me because my iPhone is in a case. If there are people who care about that, then that's okay too. At me no designer was lost so that it should have been to this Punkt.Kamera: Here I think the biggest and most important innovation. The front camera now has 7 megapixels, so far 1.2 (iPhone 6). In addition, in my opinion, the color of the main camera has greatly improved. It also has 12 megapixels, while my 6 only 8 has. Battery: Again, something has happened. The battery got stronger. Now a 1,960 mAh battery is installed. According to Apple, this now lasts 2 hours longer. How long is it until I have to swap this battery, as it was with my 6 also remains to be seen. As much as you like Apple but here is simply the biggest minus point for me. Just buy a new battery, flap on the back and exchange is simply not. No jack for splash-proof: So and now comes the best and yes that's ironic. The annoying jack connection must soften, so that the iPhone is spitzwassergeschützt. Certainly necessary, as other manufacturers have been offering this for a long time.But dear people, now I have to dodge for a Lighting-jack adapter (because I do not mind the best will not buy me these overpriced Earpods) to continue to use my usual headphones. Apart from the fact that the iPhone certainly falls 100Mal more often and breaks down than that it falls into the water. Well, but I live with it but a minus point is this deal for me all times. Display: Yes, there is no physical homebutton anymore. Is located on Spirtzwasser- and dust protection. Nevertheless, I feel the physical signal, which is triggered by pressing the non-existent button as very authentic. In terms of lighting and color strength, I can not find any significant difference, even if Apple represents the otherwise. Memory: You might think the iPhone now has more storage space. It is synonymous but only because the smallest size is now the 32GB. That's fine too, as many certainly had their problems with the smaller variants. But a really innovation looks different in this respect. Conclusion: So dear Apple friends, as the owner of an iPhone 6 or even 6s worth the switch to the 7er certainly not. Innovations are certainly present. These should be subjectively evaluated. For me, I can only draw the following conclusion: What Apple has built up in the iPhone 7 compared to the 6, they have torn at the same time with the butt again (see waterproof vs. discontinued jack). Nevertheless, Apple remains the measure of things for me in terms of the smartphone. Nevertheless, I would change as the owner of the 6er if then on the 8th or the 10th. Although you have to look at it subjectively whether the innovations for a person are really useful or maybe not. I give thus 4 stars. Alone because Apple has remained true to itself. The part is modern user-friendly and fast and in comparison to Samsung simply more valuable. Although a change is not necessarily worth the iPhone is still the measure of things and in the point of security can not be exceeded (my opinion). And you see I have not complained about capitalism or a supposedly overpriced price. As long as millions of these things are sold, it is obviously not covered yet.
7589	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Theresa	1	No new original	2017-11-08	de	Upon receipt of the delivery, the original packaging of the iPhone was already open, any protective films on the phone are missing and the charging cable is ALT, defective and held together with tape.

The background was that she got an Apple Watch 2 at Christmas 2016 and I did not know that it works exclusively with Apple products. At first I was angry and wanted to give the watch back, but then decided otherwise. It may be that certain Android smartphones are "better" in technical terms (camera e.tc.), but overall the iPhone is very convincing and a really great device. Also the shipping was smooth with fast and secure delivery.

7592	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	CEL	1	Apple no longer what it used to be.	2018-12-22	de	The software from Apple has always been lousy and ineffective, but the hardware was good so far. After a good 3 years, my iPhone has given up the ghost peux a peux. After 2 years, the battery had to be replaced, now it is weakening again. Despite the display of 37%, the phone is simply aus.Den price is the device, just like other Apple devices just not (more) worth. Too bad, but there are other manufacturers.

The part was somehow like from afar, that you could see at the sender, the long journey you could almost close out of the packaging, it was a bit battered. It was also punctual with UPS. But: The driver thought it was not necessary to press except the leaflet on the bell. So I had to go to the pickup point or shop .... and then could hold the part already two days earlier in the hand, the original packaging was hardly damaged, small bruise.

7597	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	sunshine_2205	4	Iphone 7 Matte Black	2018-08-17	de	I own the Iphone 7 for about half a year. This is my third Iphone (predecessor was the 5S and last the SE) and I have always been very satisfied with all devices. So now with the 7 Series. Compared to my old SE makes the larger display, of course, clearly noticeable! Surfing, watching videos, etc. simply everything is much more pleasant on the larger display and still the device is still handy! That was very important to me and therefore the Plus model was out of the question for me as well. Otherwise, everything is typically Apple-only reliable and stable. The camera takes great pictures and even with the battery, I can easily get over the day. What bothers me a little (which I knew, however, even before buying) is that no 3.5mm jack connection is more available. That "" normal "" headphones can only be connected by means of a supplied adapter. The reason why I can not give 5 stars, is the quality of the call when talking! One can understand the caller, but the sound is always very dull, and at not nearly as clear as my old Iphone. I find that very annoying, because even today, one of the basic features of a phone for me is the phone! I have long considered whether I should give my review only 3 stars, due to the quality of the conversation. But since I'm really happy with my iPhone 7, it ended up being (just) 4 stars.

7605	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Kings	5	Not as bad as feared !!!	2017-07-04	de	After extensive testing, I can only recommend the Iphone 7. I am completely satisfied with this product, but I have to say that the battery caused me the biggest worry in the beginning. However, I could convince myself that the battery is not as weak as it is shown on some pages, but can compete with the current smartphones in the market kann.Die camera of the iPhone is in my opinion very satisfactory and the design of the smartphone is also very convincing. The display and sound of the speakers and the call quality need not hide from the competition of Samsung etc. The price is deterrent, but IOS 10 offers many new and improved things that justify it. In conclusion, it can be said that the Iphone 7 is a good smartphone, which I strongly recommend.
7606	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Jan	4	Solid development	2016-09-20	de	First of all, I would like to refer to various other reviews: If you did not have the device in hand, should save derogatory and unqualified reviews! I have pre-ordered the device at Apple in black and 16.9. received by express. Later this year, I used the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and until recently the iPhone 6s (so no one would think I was biased). The Galaxy S7 Edge is a great device, personally it was a bit too big in the long run Since I use a MacBook as a laptop, which perfectly harmonizes with iOS devices perfectly, and the loss of value of Samsung devices is unfortunately very high, I switched to 6s, with which I would like to compare the new iPhone 7. To structure the whole thing a little , I go to the points Design, Extras, Performance, Price and Conclusion ein.1.DesignDas design of the new iPhones was already known before the Apple Keynote. Externally, compared to the 6s, little has happened. The antenna strips, which ran across the back, are fortunately now past. Furthermore, the camera was a little modified. It does not look much like a foreign object anymore, as the back covers the lens. Apple has also introduced two new colors and one painted. So there are now gold, rose gold, silver, black and diamond black. The color space gray was deleted. Last but not least, the new iPhone differs from the old one, due to the lack of a 3.5mm connector for headphones2. ExtrasThe new iPhone is touted with a whole series of "" great "" extras. For one, it is now, finally, IP67 certified, which means limited waterproof (30 minutes at 1m water depth) It also comes in two new colors and the design has been minimally modified. Furthermore, there is no physical homebutton anymore. The new homebutton is a static surface that is moved by a small motor, the Taptic Engine, to create the feeling of pressing a real button. In theory, that sounds pretty good, in practice it could be better. I personally like the new home button. He recognizes my fingerprint as well as the 6s and I can adjust the strength of the feedback. In addition, the loud click at the 6s annoyed me. The problem is that the button ONLY responds to skin contact, so it can not be pressed with gloves. Is a little problem (just press on / off switch) but not quite thought to the end. Argument for the omission of the real button was, by Apple, the waterproofness. For me that's nonsense, my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge was also waterproof, despite the normal button and headphone jack. The new camera is compared to the 6s, much better! It succeed better pictures in dim light, through the new aperture and videos are just a lot smoother, because they no longer blur due to the image stabilization. Compared to the S7 Edge, the images are relatively equal. Samsung tends to overwork the pictures too much. With the iPhone 7, the colors are more natural. Samsung has the faster Autofokus.Ein another "" Extra "" is the missing 3.5mm jack connection. This was much discussed and written. I personally do not care that much. There will be matching earpods and an adapter for the use of existing headphones included. A few magazines write of poorer audio quality when using the adapter. But if you call a smartphone with compressed music and good audio quality in one sentence, you should not take it very seriously.A nice feature compared to its predecessor are the stereo speakers. To the well-known speaker at the bottom of the device, now joins another, which is located next to the earpiece and shines forward. Sounds a lot better and louder than its predecessor. A positive development: The memory has been enlarged! Thus, the 16s in the smallest version only 16GB were installed, it is now 32GB. Next it goes with 128GB and 256GB.Ansonsten one must admit that in comparison to the predecessor has not noticeably much improved. The display is a bit brighter and shows colors better, it's a new processor on board and that's it.3. PerformanceYes, the new 7 Series breaks all benchmark records! But no one notices this in normal use! It feels as fast as the 6s. Also compared to my Galaxy S7 Edge, I see, except the operating system, no added value. For me the Galaxy is the most beautiful device but unfortunately with the wrong Software.Man can play everything with the 7 and has plenty of power for the future. However, the technical development is so far that the 6s the next two years will not be maxed out ... There are plenty of videos on YouTube, where Samsung devices are compared with Apple iPhones. In terms of gaming performance, Apple's devices are ahead, but logically, Apple has a very limited choice of devices running the iOS operating system. Adapting software for the few devices is therefore relatively easy. For Android, however, a game must be compatible for devices from 50 € - 900 € with a variety of hardware components. There has a device 1GB of memory and another 6GB. Here the adaptation of a game is much harder.4. PriceYes such an iPhone is not the cheapest smartphone. Currently the cheapest way is via the homepage of Apple itself, where the smallest version starts with 32GB at 759 T € uro. However, this is favorable compared to the previous year, as the storage variants have doubled. It should also not be left unmentioned that Samsung has demanded 699 € and the S7 Edge 799 € for the market launch of the S7. Furthermore, Apple products are subject to a much lower price decline than other electronics manufacturers.5 Conclusion: Who is the device for? Anyone who already owns an iPhone 6s with 64GB, can skip the 7er confidently. I bought it because I was able to sell my 6s for $ 600, so I could upgrade "relatively cheaply". From the iPhone 6, you notice a difference! It's a solid progression. But I think that it will not be until next year, since the iPhone is 10 years old, really interesting. Who wants to customize his device, install their own software and maybe spend less money, should make a large bow to Apple! Android offers a huge range of different devices in all price categories. Unfortunately, Samsung is now also a so-called premium brand, which is clearly noticeable in the price. The iPhone 7 is for anyone who likes to play on his device, value on a good support and for people who just want it, where everything without big problems should work. Ideally one uses already other Apple devices, since these harmonize with each other super! Of course this does not mean that you should not use an Android device with a Mac, or an iPhone can not connect to the Windows machine. In the end, it is also a matter of taste, which everyone has to meet. I hope I could make the choice easier for one or the other, I help as far as I can with any questions ...

7615	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Ben	5	Replacement for iPhone 5c 16GB	2017-01-24	de	I confess, before I bought this iPhone for the proud price, I had to think it over several nights exactly if I really wanted to spend 800 ¬ for a cell phone. You could just as well have planned a short break for the family for the money or give a car to a driver. But I thought that one could also be totally off the socks and do what you are thought to be crazy or crazy. So I bought this iPhone.Vorne away: I was already an iPhone 5c owner. I had ordered it after the apprenticeship even for 480 € as well as Amazon, because the competition MM or red Planet did not consider it necessary to get their prices under control and therefore I am Amazon my money in the throat. I have never regretted anything. Shipping and the device were first class. I had the iPhone 5c now more than 3 1/2 years in my own possession and noticed after the big IOS 10 updates that it takes my 5c but too much. Do not get me wrong, everything went really smoothly or crashes, but now and then the iPhone had its minutes of silence because the animations had to load longer than the text. And then I realized clearly the device is slowly reaching its technical limits. So I decided for a new iPhone. (Android is fine, but has its advantages, but not nearly as mature as IOS). I rummaged on Amazon several times whether it should be a 6 or a 6s. The 6er fell out because of the age again, because I had only the 6s left. (Until then, the new 7 Series was released, but priced really a limb). So after 1 month I went to MM again and looked at the device one more time. I was disturbed directly by these funny antenna strips on the back, which could have been solved elegantly by Apple, or the designer was probably at this time on treatment or had a long-term holiday. However, I fell in love with the very beautiful black front, which was impeccably finished. In addition to the new iPhone 7 was already issued and I flirted briefly. At this moment I was really amazed how chic the matte 7er but with the shifted antenna strip looked. But the good piece had its good price. After that, I looked home on Youtube for the first hands-on of the new 7 Series and the older reviews of the 6S. Technically, both were not too far apart, each device had its shortcoming. Then it grabbed me and I wanted to look at Amazon on how high the prices for the device are. And I was amazed once again about the exaggerated MM pricing policy and that of the competition "Amazon". (It should be said, MM gets you the next 12 weeks, no device, they buy only every 2 weeks 30 devices and these are directly assigned.But since MM probably did not respond to the huge demand and then ordered several devices, I would imaginary the stinky finger against this shop and against this snotty MM seller who probably had his day on this day). Amazon has just created a monopoly where good customer service, top shipping and products have found their place.So the madness grabbed me and I ordered the device in the 128GB version. The 16GB of my 5c's was really too small in the long run. Here is a video, as a few vacation photos and a few useful apps (which have really immense sizes under IOS) and from the available storage space of 12.3 were only 3GB. Clearly too little if one plans to continue shooting vacations or videos. So I made up for the last bad buy a little bit. The device was ordered on Monday evening and was already there Wednesday morning. (Without Amazon Prime probably noticed) In contrast, MM could really pack only. I grabbed it then, straight out and amazed again: If there would be smartphone pornography, Apple would have earned its golden nose. The device and the accessories were really elegant and perfectly packed. (Please do not understand me as an Apple lover / fanboy but I'm packaging industry and this high-quality packaging has its price) In this point, just anyone can not make Apple what! Device was removed and of course I as an old game hare, had to turn it directly. These 4.7 inches made something in contrast to the 4 inch screens from 2013. Much more saturated & brighter colors and much more pleasant for the Augen.Also the old Nano Sim card was taken immediately (yes, this device still has the Nano SIM card slot like the 5 Series) and plugged into the 7th. Incidentally, a backup was played on iTunes to continue to use current data from the 5c to the 7 loss-free. After the backup was transferred to the 7, I played directly with the new camera around. The new optical image stabilizer is a true dream and was long overdue, but he worked first class. In terms of performance, it was day and night between the two devices. The 7er flits without making any mischief through the menus or the Safari Explorer as there is no tomorrow. I really noticed how much my 5c was claimed by IOS 10. No wonder with only 1GB Ram and 1.3 dual core processor had their best days long behind .... Well after another 2 weeks with the device, I have not regretted the purchase of the device. Even if the purchase price was pretty heavy at first. However, it must be remembered that development costs for updates and the technology of the device also flow into the purchase price. Of course, Apple also earns a fair share of the rest, but the poor managers still earn too little! : o) I will shoot after the first half of the device with a few updates afterwards. And for all new customers who intend to buy an iPhone, always buys a larger storage variant. A better repurchase value & a greater benefit reward you in the future with the device.

7618	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Johann H.	4	iPhone top, seller hmmm	2016-12-22	de	The iPhone 7 is a very good smartphone, I will not go into that. What bothers me is that there is only a 3-month warranty from Apple, as it is a refurbished device. The seller should have stated the same! Recommendation to you: Go to google and search for "" apple warranty "". Then enter your serial number and you know how long the warranty on the device is.
7619	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Silvija	5	Yes. Everything OK	2017-06-27	de	Although I already ordered a lot about Amazon but here I am very unsure if I should actually make the order over the Internet. Fear was whether the goods actually arrives, in what condition and whether it is an original. Have even opened packaging under the eyes of the postman to have a witness if carton should be empty or similar fears should prove true.So end good all good.Handy came on time. Device corresponds to the original which was bought in Austria. (Have both placed next to each other and one: one compared. Color, size, thickness, functions = ident Menu navigation worked immediately in German Handy is impeccable and works even after a month in the operation excellent Am of course curious if it stays that way or how Apple or dealer in case of a defect would react.For the packaging is not much to say was sufficient.Phone is unlocked.It was impeccably recognized by two different providers simcards immediately.Various apps are supported.Web Internet and mail forwarding work.The setting went virtually by itself .Preissparnis still pretty high. Especially if you should consider with a sim card with a cheap provider and the savings there.With an often overpriced tariff, the phone is indeed paid twice and that even with years of binding.Can say with relief: So actually buying recommended.

Of course, tastes are different but with the iPhone 7 you can basically go wrong. It is always worth the money. Unfortunately there were delivery problems but that has nothing to do with the product.
7624	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	happior	5	Good upgrade, but no must-have feature	2016-09-20	de	I have used the iPhone 6s for a year and have now intensively tested the iPhone 7 for several days. I will describe in detail my experiences in comparison to the previous generation and update the test in the future. For questions just in the comments report. If I helped in the purchase decision, I would be in return on a like look! Optics iPhone 7 looks essentially like the 6 or 6s. Only the antenna strips on the back are a little inconspicuous designed and the camera nubs is now no longer like a porthole out, but was filigree incorporated into the case (I think the pictures show the differences quite well). From the processing, the smartphone is top, you can expect this price but also. Incidentally, I myself use a protective cover, because I'm always scared of dropping it at the rounded corners. In addition, the diamond-black variant is susceptible to scratching. Looks cool, but is a real fingerprint magnet, after a short time you have the feeling, half the neighborhood had the device in hand. So always have the cleaning cloth ready ;-) Waterproof Case Apple advertises the iPhone 7 with IP67 certification, so it's dustproof and waterproof for 30 minutes to a depth of one meter. So much for the theory. In practice, the iPhone 7 survive a lot, as various Youtube videos show, even a dip in the hot coffee. I just kept it under the tap, and there was no damage. But I do not want to dive with it, but can only make calls in the rain, without fear that the phone will break. Screen The screen measures 4.7 inches, which I consider a very pleasant size. Unfortunately, my hands have not grown as fast as the smartphone industry plans, so I can handle large smartphones beyond the 5.5-inch size with only two hands. The iPhone 7, a one-hand operation is just so possible. The colors and contrasts are very good, if you look from the side of the screen, there are no significant color distortions. From the much brighter display that Apple advertises, I have noticed little - but I turn the screen brightness anyway only in the blazing sunlight to maximum.KameraNun the most important: the camera. The 12-megapixel snap-on now also has an optical image stabilizer, which was reserved in the past two years, only the Plus models. Video footage in the movement are not as blurred as the 6s, in photos, the effect is not so recognizable in my opinion. During the day, the pictures were also good in the previous year, here there are only improvements in detail - such as finer color differences (the camera can record an extended color space to DCI-P3). You can see the differences in low light conditions, such as at night or in dark clubs. The f / 1.8 aperture of the iPhone 7 lets out more light than the 6s (f / 2.2). Unfortunately, the dual camera with which you can optically zoom is only available in the Plus model. The new quadruplet flash feels a bit further, but does no miracles. Whether the pictures are better than the Galaxy S7, is a matter of taste - the S7 makes sharper, bangier recordings, the iPhone 7 seems a little more restrained. Overall, the camera is superior to that of the 6s but in every way. The selfie camera now has 7 instead of 5 megapixels, pictures are a bit sharper. Missing headphone jack Yes, the headphone jack is missing. The package comes with a pair of Lightning headphones and a Lightning-to-jack adapter. According to technical measurements, the sound is somewhat impaired, I could not hear much difference with my headphones - sounded the same as before. That may be different with really expensive premium devices. Best in case of doubt before in the shop or a friend with iPhone 7 probesteen.I have been using bluetooth headphones anyway for some time. Who connects the iPhone with the jack adapter to the car radio, must remember that he can not charge the device at the same time. The new HomebuttonThe Home button, which exists since the first iPhone, is no longer a real button, but was replaced by a touch surface , A vibration motor inside simulates a click. This feels strange at first, but you get used to it quickly. Quite as "" real "" as the Macbook but it does not feel, perhaps because the trackpad is larger there. In general, I like the new "Taptic Engine" that provides vibration - turning the alarm on, for example, makes you feel like you're spinning on a real, mechanical device. Big disadvantage: The Home button can not be pressed with gloves, as the fingerprint scanner will not respond. Sounds banal, but you can unlock the iPhone but not. I imagine that in really cold winter nights annoying. I'm curious, maybe you can fix that via update. StorageBislang had the entry-level 16 gigabytes, now it starts at 32 gigabytes. Since there is no microSD card slot, but you should better grab the 128 gigabyte iPhone (costs 110 euros more). Then you do not have to worry about downloading apps or music on Spotify or snapping lots of photos. The top model has 256 gigabytes, which should only need the least. Battery Apple keeps the battery for two hours longer, I myself felt no real improvement. But that may also depend on the personal usage mix. I regularly use social networks, check e-mails 5-6x a day, read 25 minutes in the morning and evening in the train, get push messages and take some pictures. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are always running. At the end of the day, the smartphone has to be plugged in, more than a day's runtime is not there. Processor Short for computing power: The new A 10 chip is extremely fast, as benchmarks show. In the menu you have nowhere annoying stuttering, but you honestly had the 6s not. Anyone who plays will be able to enjoy more elaborate 3D games in the future, while everyone else will not need the extra computing power. In any case, the processor is state of the art and you're on the safe side for a few years in terms of updates. Stereo Speakers The new stereo speakers are louder and a bit clearer than the mono speaker earlier, but one should not expect miracles. The LG G5, for example, has a more impressive stereo effect. But I prefer to listen to music anyway with the headphones and do not let the whole train listen:) Conclusion If you look once from the new colors, optically not much new is offered. The iPhone 7 is chic, but the wide frame is not quite contemporary. Robust is the smartphone, in the trouser pocket has not bent yet. I liked the better camera and the waterproof case. The new home button is a bit unusual, let's see if more developers will integrate it into their apps (the interface is released). With the battery life one should expect no miracles, the small iPhones must be loaded as usual every night. I certainly will not tell anyone anything new when I say that an iPhone is more expensive than the competition. Comparable Android phones are available for 500-600 Euro, but they do not have an iOS operating system - and for many people it's also about convenience. For my part, I can recommend the iPhone 7. If you already have an iPhone 6 / 6s and you do not want the camera or the waterproof case, you can still wait a year without hesitation.

7635	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Marvin Singh	4	Conclusion after 6 months and is the purchase still worthwhile?	2017-10-13	de	I had an iPhone 6s then I switched to the SE because of the better size. Then I switched to the iPhone 7, because my SE has been destroyed by various accidents in the drunk (RIP iPhone SE). After more than 6 months I have now decided to draw a conclusion. The iPhone 7 is a very good smartphone, which is very well processed. The new Home Button is a dream and feels incredibly cool every time I press it. All in all, the phone does what it should. It's fast, the photos look very good and the battery lasts one day. Let's get to the points of criticism. On the one hand, in my opinion, it is the high radiation value (SAR value). This is much higher on the iPhone 7 than its predecessors. With a mobile phone for just under 700 € an absolute no-go. The second is the battery. Yes, he keeps a great day, but that's about it. In today's age you already wish that the battery may last at least 2 days, but well. Is it still worth the iPhone 7 to buy? In my opinion, already! My friend has thanks to a contract extension the iPhone 8. In my opinion, a superfluous cell phones. Hardly any changes to the iPhone 7. Yes, it can be charged wirelessly and of course it has more power .... but honestly, you do not see a speed advantage in direct comparison! The camera has been minimally improved, even here at first glance, no differences. But then prefer the iPhone X although that is not my taste at all, but that's my personal opinion. So if you are looking for a good phone is the iPhone 7 well served. If the phone would break now, I would buy it again today, although there is the iPhone 8 and the X is in the starting blocks. I hope I could help.

7644	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Seba83	3	Evaluation from the point of view of a transferor	2016-09-27	de	Before I start to judge the device, I have to explain myself briefly. I've been an Android user for my entire (smartphone) life and am not out of dissatisfaction, but out of pure curiosity to Apple. And since I am a tech enthusiast I usually do not have too many problems with such a change. I am well aware that there are a lot of fanboys and hunters in both camps. Many still cite the higher stability and performance as an argument for the Iphone. And that was the way it was then. But today it's really snow of yesterday. There is no noticeable difference in performance between an Android flagship and an Iphone. My S6 Edge has not even crashed in a year and a half - and I could not see any of that. So this argument is really a very old hat and only applicable when comparing an Iphone with a low budget Android device. Otherwise - Pustekuchen.Aber we now come to the actual test "Gentlemen, this is a nice device." So or so were my first thoughts when I unpacked the Iphone. Made from one piece and extremely high quality. Also extremely perfect in terms of weight. Just as hard that you feel something valuable in your hand. I opted for the dull black version, which I also rate here today. The only unattractive are the streaks on the back which arise during use, but of course can be wiped away again. Similar to fingerprints.The new homebutton: I only know the old one from friends and family, because I've never had an Iphone myself before, but this thing really worked. Not a real button, but it feels the same way. (One feels an (adjustable) resistance during printing Very well resolved and virtually unbreakable In my eyes a eliminated breaking point Very good! The missing headphone jack: So I'm missing nothing here The adapter works well and the included headphones are not the course Yellow of the egg, but quite usable. The operation: I took about 2-3 days to get used to IOS is indeed logical - as a newcomer or beginner, but then it worked really well.Of course, the Android user lacks a bit of comfort here at one point or another. (see point: Differences to Android) Therefore, the system seems to me in one way or another not quite thought out. But man is known to be a beast of habit and bad IOS is by no means. The Camera: The is perfectly fine and up to date. The pictures are good to very good, although sometimes they tend to blur. Also, colors are more natural or slightly paler. But if I remember correctly too soon a too high saturation of the colors was criticized. Is and remains a matter of taste. The front camera is without a doubt damn good. If not the best of me ever tested on a smartphone. The battery: As I said, I have no comparison to other Iphones - but know that was criticized in previous devices always as a weak point. I do not see that here at the 7th. The battery is not outstanding, but also no point to criticism. Throughout the day you get wonderful with medium use. The screen: crisp, but somehow a bit darker than I'm used to. Even if I turn off the automatic brightness and "full turn up" the background image is still darker than the "original image". I can not explain myself and that bothers me a bit. The experts among you may like me in the comments remedy.The pace: Since I do not play, I understand the point not synonymous tested. The surfing page setup is perfectly okay and pretty fast. As it should be with a top smartphone. Unlocking via Touch ID also works reliably and quickly. Only when quitting apps via the home button, there are occasionally small stuttering in the animation. Does not really bother, but annoys me in the otherwise buttery performance but a little bit.Gravierende differences to Android: (This point is not included in the evaluation, but is certainly interesting for one or the other future Umsteiger) - You can not mark several contacts at once. (to copy or delete) - You can not align the apps on the screen at the bottom of the grid (About the fixed apps) - It will not automatically different photo folders for example. WhatsApp and Facebook created. Everything is stored under photos and you have to sort yourself.- I can not finish all open tasks at once, but have to swipe each one up individually.- There is no "" back "" button. You can find this option somewhere on the page or in the App.- Setting new ringtones is already a small act about Itunes. This is not directly on the phone. The sound (speakers): Absolutely no criticism at this point. Clean stereo sound, the best I've ever heard on a smartphone. Even the ringtones sound really nice. Conclusion: It is and remains a question of faith. Apple has certainly (probably also consciously) left some air here. But it is and remains a top smartphone at a very very high level. But it is certainly the best opportunity so far, even for newcomers to dive into the world of Apple. And if you then decide against it again - the resale value of Iphones is so far undefeated on the smartphone market. I'll stay in this world for a while. I like every now and then changes. But my opinion remains - IOS is different than Android - but not better. ;) Supplement 30.09.2016In the meantime I use the device for a week and I noticed something different from Android. I used to like to turn on Airplane Mode to answer several Whats App messages (so I do not get new messages when writing). I could then simply send them and they were then sent when I have turned off the flight mode again. That was also quite handy if you had no reception - write messages and send went anyway. Whats App has then sent automatically if you had network or Wi-Fi again. That does not work with IOS, here one can not on "" send "" press if one has no receipt. I find a bit annoying to be honest.Supplement 11.10.2016Language quality telephonyMittlerweile I've tested the quality of the phone calls on the heart and kidneys for me personally everything is impeccable and excellent.I can not understand any criticism, maybe that's also more of a personal feeling. ApronsI can now understand much less why the Apple disciples are always screaming that the iphone never crashes. There have been 3 times in the last weeks the situation that the homebutton did not react even though the unlock was displayed. Twice I was able to save myself via the camera in the menu, once I had to turn off the phone completely. Annoying! If this happens more often I will have to adjust the evaluation. Nachtrag 02.12.2016I have now sold my Iphone again and I (actually to bridge the new Android flagship next year) come an Honor 8 fetched. And I am completely thrilled. After I had this device for less than 400 euros in the hand, I was mystified why people seriously spend more money on a phone. But that is not an issue here. Reasons for me to resell the Iphone were the following: - The size. 4.7 inches are really too small for me. 5.5 inches, on the other hand, too big. Yes, I am quite funny about that. And the Iphone 7 Plus is also significantly larger than other representatives with these screen dimensions.- The missing "" back "" button. That's comfort for me. I really missed the Iphone.- The "" unsorted "" photo folder. That really drove me crazy now. All photos from all sources in a folder. And then you can sort yourself. Itunes (without comment;) The Iphone is really not a bad phone. And who knows nothing else will probably love it too. But it has nothing more mystical and of course has its lags and crashes. Even more than my former S6. It remains a smart and functional smartphone that is well worth its money. For me it makes a much cheaper phone much happier. For price / performance, I then pull off a star again at the end. Thus, we end up with three stars, even with a half in mind;)

7652	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	☀️Sunny²	5	Once iPhone, always iPhone: the 7!	2017-04-11	de	I have now obsessed with every iPhone and also made frequent trips to the Android camp. Remarkably, I always landed at Apple. I was not 100% satisfied with every iPhone, I always missed something. Either the photo quality was not great, the operating system was pretty sluggish over time, the screen was too small or the voice quality was not 100% convincing. With this device Apple hit me completely black and (almost) everything right. Here are my personal highlights of the new iPhone 7: The camera has improved Apple: Already at the first photo, I was completely convinced of her. So far, I've always been a bit jealous of the Galaxy Camera, the times are definitely over now. A new image signal processor and a 4x LED flash (True Tone), which according to the manufacturer is 50 percent brighter than the iPhone 6s, improves the camera. It now has: • 12 megapixels • 1.8 aperture • 4K video recording at 30 frames per second • Slow motion video up to 240 frames per second at 720p • Optical image stabilization • Face and body recognition • HDR, continuous shooting, panoramas etc.The selfie HD The camera has an automatic image stabilization and a 7-megapixel sensor. Flash acts as before the smartphone display, but a lot better than the predecessor iPhone 6 & iPhone 6s. Here, Apple has really done a great job, photos and selfies make me again fun, even in poor picture conditions, the pictures are sensational. That's exactly what I wanted! Stereo speakers for the iPhoneWhen you play games or even watch a YouTube video, you can now fully enjoy its costs. From the lower speakers and the outer ear, there is now a nice stereo sound that I do not want to miss anymore. Now music or listening to an audio book is twice as much fun. According to Apple, it is twice as strong as its predecessor and I can only agree. The jack plug has disappeared, does not really bother me. I've been using Bluetooth headphones for a while, or listen to loudspeakers as I said. The iPhone 7 is (finally!) Waterproof after IP67. Something that is delayed by the iPhone gets splash and dust protection.I've been wishing for some time, finally, one is on the safe side. For underwater shots, the protection is not enough, rainy phone calls or a trip to the beach is nothing in the way. The battery life up to 2 hours longer than the iPhone 6s: I hated the iPhone 6s, the battery life was just under all cannon. This update was badly needed. Finally, I can get by with my battery until late in the evening. It now has: • up to 14 hours of talk time with 3G • up to 14 hours of internet use over Wi-Fi • up to 13 hours of video playback.New Taptic engine Home Button: The home button is no longer a mechanical button, but only sensor surfaces, from The Taptic engine is now given a haptic feedback that gives the user the feeling of actually having something depressed. The habituation goes straight into the flesh, it seems somehow more modern and works perfectly. The Taptic Engine gives the user but also in other areas feedback: if you pull down about the message center from the top of the screen, the home button vibrates as soon as the window below "" hits "". Just like the alarm clock: he rings and shakes the alarm. These are playful little things, but exactly this love of detail I like at Apple. Pro great camera with good image quality in low light Waterproof case High speed thanks to Apple A10 Fusion processor with 4 cores Stereo speakers new Force Touch Homebutton beautiful 25% brighter display good battery RuntimeContra- no fast charging mode- no cell phone induction charging- no memory extension►►► ►► CONCLUSION: I love it! I am really happy that I have bought it myself. Brighter display, a great workmanship, extremely fast performance and durable battery compared to my iPhone 6s. My personal highlights are the two cameras and the stereo speakers. Everything I got from my iPhone 6s as extras have been desired, was realized.In terms of performance, Apple has the iPhone 7 once again put on a dashing. The new A10 Fusion processor has four cores: 2 cores are used for demanding applications such as 3D games, the other two are battery saver and Unfortunately there is no fast-charging function and Qi on board, which will definitely be saved for the Iphone 8. I regret the update of my Iphone 6s and can definitely recommend the Iphone 7.
7653	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Flosse14	5	Apple iPhone vs. Samsung Galaxy	2017-04-24	de	I read the recessions on the iPhone 7 with surprise. Why? To penalize a product with only a "*" star because Apple is on it, or you are just a Samsung fan, or think the iPhone is too expensive, and ... .. has nothing, but also nothing to do with the functionality or reliability of the product and falsified only knowingly the assessment of the relevant criteria. Why do people slice only such a "Dünnsch ...." in a so for us buyers so useful product medium? When I make a selection I would like to be told technical and other helpful experiences but not if someone the Appel brand hate because Apple pays no taxes in Germany ... .. I have the request to all who take the time to write a recession to remain factual and for "us" who want to decide yet, useful hints down write.

7655	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Syno	5	Much steam under the hood	2017-05-21	de	The iPhone 7 screen is better than last year, but compared to the competition is far from the best. In terms of resolution, brightness and contrast, Samsung shows what current display technology can achieve. That the iPhone 7 is better than the previous model , under the metal housing is a powerful processor: The A10 Fusion is to ensure that the smartphone in the pixel hunt on iOS 10 nothing to hang. The processor has 4 cores, with 2 of them according to Apple with a fifth of the energy. The two high-performance cores run only under demanding tasks under full steam. The iPhone 7 is thanks to A10 processor according to Apple 40 percent faster than iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.
7656	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	1	Bad sound quality	2017-09-14	de	Unfortunately, very poor sound quality. For Apple, a descent. I have problems with my interlocutor who understands me very badly or not at all. Seems Apple does not register.
7657	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Boris	1	Rather a status symbol than a workhorse	2017-05-28	de	I wanted to get my age rather mature iPhone 4s replace a newer model. Since I use a MacBook to work with the usual compatibility among the devices was very important. So a new iPhone had to come from. Meanwhile, I use the new phone for about 4 months. Positive: -optimal display size-Touch ID is very handy for unlocking the screen-waterproof housing-a pretty good camera-the system runs very fast (although the difference to 4s but not so enormous is as I have imagined) Negative: -GPS is quite inaccurate (seems to be a known problem of the 7 models) -Akka performance is not optimal. After 2 days not so intensive use (GPS, e-mail / write, surf, phone) the battery is quickly empty. Unfortunately, this is not enough for me, considering that these are standard applications and not resource-hungry games. Unfortunately, older headphones can only be connected via an adapter. Conclusion: With the iPhone 7, you get a modern but extremely overpriced device, that with scores some features but also has some weaknesses. As far as the price performance is concerned, the cell phone did not convince me. Although I can understand that one pays the brand name here. But with the price level you expect something more. And the difference to an older model like the 4s (built in 2012) is not that huge. If you are not dependent on Apple products and do not necessarily need a mobile phone as a status symbol, you will be better off with much cheaper Android phones. # Update 2018 #After over 1.5 years, the phone is completely greased. The display simply went off, since then failed all revival attempts. According to the report, there is a hardware defect. Something I did not expect Apple device now! The Amazon Marketplace seller CVV is no longer responsive after the return. The money is gone!

7659	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	nichtl	4	Development in order, but this time partly in the wrong direction	2017-01-08	de	So far, I've been through every iPhone generation (as there was always a reason to switch) - so I'm coming from the iPhone 6s right now, and I'm referring to it mostly. About the 6s I wrote and other long reports. The iPhone 7 has somehow hardly triggered a credit-Will-reflex. I bought it only because my mother wanted to change from her 5 and wanted my 6s. When I had the 7 in my hand, I seriously thought about using the 6s - the differences are absolutely marginal. The things that are better on the 7th pick it up, which makes it worse than the iPhone 6s. I do not really need a super development and something new every year. But I do not want to go backwards. Things that are the same or only marginally better for the 6s: - Speed ​​(absolutely seamless and smooth) - Display (still no full black, but quite close to it) - Camera housing quality (still very nice) - Software (no difference) - Battery life is slightly higher. Has with me after 2 days still some remaining time. I also do not check Twitter 10x / hDinge, which makes the iPhone 7 better: - Waterproof (but without guarantee ... well, then only halfhearted anyway) - No more mechanical Homebutton (a gateway less) - Much better speakers (me personally not important, mainly for ringtone) - design a shade better because antenna strip is now at the bend. Things that make the iPhone 7 worse (than the 6s): - GPS is a lot less accurate (annoys me a lot because I have many ways There is no bad reception!) - NO Headphone-Jack: I have to do this shortly in more detail. I am not against dropping the latch and consider it a necessary step. BUT: the only remaining connection is LIGHTNING, which is ONLY to be found on Apple devices, so NOT universal as jack, USB-C. I'm assuming that USB-C will replace the jack, which is good as manufacturer-specific. You'll need an adapter forever if you want to hear music → Absolute regression, almost scandalous. It would have been correct: install USB-C. I do not know why people do not get upset. Conclusion: For the first time I'm not happier with the new generation than with the previous one. But that does not change the fact that the device is an extremely high-quality, reliable piece of technology. The regressions did not have to be. That's why 4 stars.
7660	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	4	A very good slide	2017-07-05	de	The film sits perfectly and has saved my phone one or the other times after a fall. What I do not like, however, is that the shell on the home button and on the front speakers dirt collects and then you have to blow it back strong.
7661	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	delpackulati	1	Useless to iOS 11 update	2017-11-24	de	After the update to iOS 11, the phone barely works. The screen freezes constantly. Apps crash. Battery empty much faster
7662	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Patrick	5	Successful upgrade for me coming from the iPhone 6	2016-09-17	de	After almost two years with the iPhone 6, I made the switch to the iPhone 7 on the key date. An overview can be found here in my video. Of course, this can not show all aspects without becoming long. In addition to this, so here are some sentences here: For someone who like me has omitted the 6s Force Touch, so the pressure-sensitive display, and such a home button is a new experience. But for me in any case a good one. In iOS 10, the sensitivity for the Home Button as well as for the display in 3 levels, so that after a short settling time and the difference between tap and hold - for umlauts - and press works. I had some problems with that for the first few hours. The device itself is no different than the iPhone 6. It's 10 grams heavier, but that does not really matter. The display is better and you can read it well in bright sunlight. The speaker has also gotten better and can quack a bit louder. The lack of the jack plug is one thing I have accepted. Apple has always been a company that has cut off old braids and the old analog jack plug belongs m.M.n. also to. And where is the problem? There are plenty of alternatives and headphones with Lightning port for mobile use. The supplied adapter is not a nice solution, because it looks a bit too filigree - replacement costs 10 euros at Apple but I would complain about it but a defect within the warranty period in the store - but it works properly, so that old headphones or amplifiers continue to be used can. Loading and listening is currently not possible. But Belkin has announced a solution and an (expensive) adapter.The aftermarket will certainly soon offer cheaper alternatives. So just leave the church in the village. The included EarPods with Lightning connection work well and the sound is fine, the left is not good for me and I'm always worried, the things are falling out of my ears, so I'm now Lightning InEars of a third party manufacturer ordered. Largest invisible innovation, which I have not mentioned in the video: the iPhone is dust and water protected to IP67 (I = dust class 6, P = water class 7). It may so fall into the water for up to 30 minutes at a maximum of 1m depth without it breaks it. However, this is not part of the guarantee and a wet device must not be charged, it must first be allowed to dry. But that should already say the common sense;) The protruding camera was not quite my thing with the iPhone 6, the even larger and still a little further out standing camera of the iPhone 7 are no exception. And although I was concerned about scratching the glass on iPhone 6 - and even more about iPhone 7 - that did not happen. However, I am also very careful with my things, so whether that is universal I can not say. A protection would help anyway and this is the only real downside of the iPhone. But compensates the camera with good photos on the level of a good compact camera with a fixed focal length of 28mm KB equivalence and 4k video. All in all, I find my upgrade from the iPhone 6 with 128 GB to the iPhone 7 with 128 GB and I'm up the small software bug in iOS 10, which can empty the battery empty, satisfied. But this bug will be fixed quickly, thanks to Apple's good update policy. Everything else works as expected or better. Quality and impression are correct and I am pleased about (m) a new device. The old man has reliably done 2 years of service with me and was therefore absolutely worth his money. It will certainly satisfy the next owner. For my part I recommend every iPhone 6 owner to upgrade to the 7. It is worth from my point of view due to display, speakers, battery power, camera / video and the very fast operation.
7663	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Mult	5	Top device!	2017-07-09	de	Top device! Super fast and very high quality feel! The price hurts something, but would buy the device again and again! Runs error-free without crashes! Since only Lightning also much dustproof!
7664	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Jeffrey van Dijk	5	Absolutely recommended <3	2017-08-07	de	Hello, in advance I apologize for my spelling. Who wants a short conclusion should rather read the last section below. To me and the choice of this smartphone: I am zz. 20 years old and have already quite a LOT of mobile phones durch.Ich grew up in my childhood without a telephone or other Schnick Schnack. I had only one Gameboy. My first phone I got in the 7th grade (a LG KP500) which was a touch phone. After some time I got my second mobile phone a samsung galaxy (with some longer number) my very first "" smartphone "" admitted I did not use all these "" crass "" features of a smartphone. I only needed it to write with friends on WhatsApp or Facebook and Telln with Muddi. Also this phone broke sometime, because I had to buy my own smartphone. This was not possible without a side job ... so now a wanted (newspaper distribution) and money saved. Back then I bought a Kazam (a cheap China brand) I was just not willing to pay 100 Euro for a cell phone. However, this phone was broken. After several years and teachers phones from samsung Sony and co. I thought to buy an iPhone, these were so popular and gehyped .. now with the beginning of my apprenticeship, I bought my first hand on financing, no problem had been counted 200 € and twice a year then a rate of 35 €. Good deal I thought to me ... but even this Telefong broke after a year. (I was more excited about Apple than any of the other phones I've had.Because it was not plastic special alu, was not unnecessarily huge and the operating system was mega easy to understand). One year later (last year) Kahm then samsung Galaxy s7 out .. it was praised so much that I decided to one Contract with mobilcom debitel to take with just this phone. Absolute wrong decision. I do not want to say that the phone is bad, but it was much harder to get along with this phone than with an iPhone .. just because it has too many features I do not need. It was down to me after 3 weeks and was broken in spite of bulletproof glass and cell phone case ... I had ne insurance but from suitable laziness I have not given it. Logically, it broke more and more and now after a year I faxed it thick. I have now bought an iPhone 7 directly from Apple on financing, with 100 € deposit and a half-yearly rate of 80 €. Many think now, what a spast but not just not. I have now brought the s7 for repair and then sell it for 350 ¬ of which I pay the iPhone 7 with. Why the iPhone 7 and not wait for a new one? Why an iPhone generally? Is it worth it for me to use an iPhone? Well I'm not waiting for the new iPhone for the reason that it probably will be priceless anyway because there is an anniversary coming up. I just think that the operating system IOS is easy to understand and clear. It offers certain advantages over android, for example that more people are hacked using android because it is simply more represented. If you are crazy about games you have the advantage that most of the known games come first for iOS than for android. Personally, I find it extremely noble that the Apple for its iPhone on aluminum as a frame, etc, it just feels PORN **. Apple stands for premium (others may see it differently, but I do not) Some argue about the technical data of the different phones, personally I do not care about whether a mobile app opens at the speed of light or not, it is important to me It is worthwhile to buy an iPhone 7 only if you have not had a newer iPhone for some time or if you tell yourself you want the latest from the new one to have it in the Compared to the iPhone 6s not much changed, the button is now a touch sensor instead of a real button, there is no aux more, instead stereo speakers (the aux is missing is absolutely not bad as I think). The iPhone 7 lasts for about 45 minutes in the water and the iPhone 6s never 5 minutes. If you want to have the technical data in mind, however, should ask a professional or read the Internet smart. My personal conclusion is: it's worth it, it's fun and offers exactly what you imagine. Thank you for your attention
7665	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	StoryFan	4	High quality, fast, nice design, handy.	2017-01-03	de	I prefer to do it not so long, but flush. You can look at technical data on the original Apple website. I have had iPhone 5s since it came on the market. Even this aging iPhone had not shown a single problem in 4 years. Only the Akuu was not as strong as you wanted it to be + Okay so now I have the Iphone 7 in gold with 32GB. With 4.7 "" screen size, it is just right for me and my big fingers. Also fits in the pocket of the jacket or trouser. + It feels great and is remarkably well made. + The design is perfect for the 7 Series because the antenna (white plastic line) is even better hidden now and more of the beautiful aluminum can be seen. + The Akuuleistung is finally good. Not very good as with other providers, but really good. With me the Akuu now holds good 1.5 to 2 days. (I hardly play games, but I write a lot, check mails and surf the net) + Technically, everything is great. Mobile is very fast. Reacts really fix. Fingerscann is lightning fast. Also the 3D Touch is cool, but could be even better with more features. + Photos can be really beautiful. The live photos are something new, I like it a lot. + Screen is now really bright even in daylight and easy to read. Screen resolution I find personally mega successful.- What I would like to complain about a little, is the radiation value during the phone. That should not exceed the mark 2.0 and the iPhone 7 of course does not, but with just 1.8 value, it is already very high compared to my old Iphone 5s or compared to other popular mobile phones.- The second minus for the Iphone7 is the price. Yes, I know the development costs are high, but from the manufacturing and the materials ago, one could quite offer a different price and a large part of the development of the Iphones itself, is already done.
7666	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Martin	2	windfall	2017-07-31	de	This is my last iPhone since Generation 4's loyal customer! Why? For me, the iPhone has always been a "state of the art" product far beyond the competition, Jobs put a lot of passion in the development of devices next to a status symbol perfection In the point of quality and customer service was clearly noticeable in the first iPhones that this is a premium product. But with Generation 6, I noticed clearly that simply no lifeblood is in the development of the device, camera lenses that "slip" "and allegedly not a reason for complaint are ... just as the service of me hard on technology manufacturer of discounter reminiscent. Positive thinking, but I have decided for the 7, in the hope that it is a mature 6er (because optically has changed nothing), but I already regretted that after a very short time: / Yes the device brings innovations in comparison to the 6 series: - a button that is no longer a button- Forcetouch- Faster processor (who notices it, I do not) - better camera (I notice only in very faint pictures) For it likes to hang up for a few seconds, which I had previously experienced on any iPhone. Sometimes it has also simply do not feel like talking on the phone, and then with "" Call Failed "" word. In these situations, man can enjoy the silence of life, because without the one notices it (network is connected normally), callers are as busy / or unavailable signaled, without which you can even note it. If that was not enough, has my wife, who bought the same device in a different color at the same time, the same Probleme.Für me is the "" fun "" iPhone by the end of next year to extend the contract. Because it no longer embodies what it once was and the competition has not overslept the last 5 years, here was tightened and there are now significantly cheaper devices available that are similarly powerful .... but you pay not here for the name or the bad Kundenservice.Zur rating: I rate here with 2 stars because I product and price link together. Hot, for 250 ¬ I would give 4 stars, because it is simply a "" standard smartphone "" is. At a price of about 1000 €, however, I expect premium and the device is in no wise fair. If my recession has helped you in the product, I would be happy about a "" thumbs up "".
7667	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Klaatu1960	5	Impressively good device!	2017-04-28	de	I have it for about 3 months now and there is nothing to moan about. I am fully satisfied. Interesting are the extreme negative ratings (1 star). For some, I can understand the reason, if e.g. an empty box arrives. But that has nothing to do with the device itself. Here are some again the iPhone z.b. as "" scrap "" designate and one senses when reading the despicable and obviously pathological attitude to Apple and their products. Unfortunately, I can not understand something like that. It is only a product! Actually it should be so that one can write here only a product recession if this product also here. bought through Amazon. So now every stupid Apple haters "puke" here "and write things of what he actually has no idea. That should reconsider Amazon!
7668	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Amazon Kunde	5	Perfect device	2017-04-23	de	Have now for about half a year, my IPhone. First the color is beautiful and the workmanship is perfect. You could set it up very quickly and use it completely after just one day. My cell phone has fallen loose 10 times (no bulletproof glass) and it has not broken. Whether on tiles, wood, grass, carpet or stone, it has not broken. Overall, it's the best product I've ever ordered on Amazon.
7669	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	André	4	Abstract Iphone 7	2017-09-25	de	I got the iPhone 7 32GB silver in the media market at the start of the sale for € 760 and will now give you some important details about the device and share my personal experience with you.1. Display: One strength of the iPhone is the 4.7 inch display. The display is extremely bright and you really have the perfect picture quality in all lighting conditions. That's just awesome. So this display is really very stable in viewing angles. Battery: The battery lasts a day very difficult. Most of the time I have to recharge it for the day. However, this leads to the fact that I always have to take a break while using it, so I can charge the Iphone. Since I talk a lot, like to listen to music and occasionally watch videos, I have to charge the device again and again, because the iPhone is the day (with normal use) not persevere.3. Memory: I'm glad that Apple is finally a little bit over time and in the basic version offers at least 32GB of memory. Less would be synonymous really out of date and at 32GB I currently have around 14GB of free space, which is at least sufficient for me. I always transfer my photos and videos to the PC and music streaming is usually or delete them again, if I've heard enough. that the next largest version but then already delivers 128GB is in my eyes a little bit fierce or here Apple wants to bring one again, again put it on € 110. I do not think that's good, but the price / performance ratio is ok.4. Operating SystemWith the latest version of iOS, I'm generally quite satisfied, but here I still have the most to complain about. The interaction between Hard & Software seems to have worsened a bit, because despite the high performance of the A10 Fusion chip and the 2GB RAM, I had micro-stutters in some apps or the iPhone has not always responded immediately to my input. Also, when updating apps in the appstore, sometimes it does not work right now and the process stops and you have to restart the upgrade. This happens "" still "" relatively little and I sincerely hope that Apple here in the future nachbessert (perhaps with iOS 11?). Also, I find the whole design a bit boring now and as it looked the same when switching from iPhone 6 to 7, the joy was rather muted. But what iOS 11 has already promised everything makes me feel positive for the future. Camera: The cameras in the iPhone 7 solve now on the back with 12MP and on the front with 7MP and very important; In addition to the iPhone 7 Plus, now has the small version of an optical image stabilizer. The pictures are really good and the color representation is really great. Thanks to the optical stabilizer, videos in motion are now much quieter and no longer as blurred as on the 6 (s). In the dark, although still a fairly high noise can be seen, but that was more with the predecessors.I'm really glad when switching from 1.2MP to 7MP (front camera), because here the difference is really enormous. Finally, you can shoot really good selfies with the iphone and that the entire screen serves as a flash is also extremely good. Speakers: Finally, finally, the iPhone 7 has stereo sound and can compete in this segment with devices such as the HTC flagship series. So far, in my opinion, it has always been modest to hear music or video on the iPhone through the speakers, but that's more or less over now. The speaker in the earpiece is not as strong as the conventional one on the bottom of the phone (and you can hear it), but the sound is currently much more homogeneous than before and I really appreciate the iPhone 7 for that. If you still support the apt-x or high-resoluiton audio (I know there is Apple Lossless), that would be perfect.7. Performance: Inside, of course, has done a lot and the iphone 7 has now an A10 fusion processor with 4 instead of 2 cores and 2GB Ram RAM. However, two of the four cores are only there to do more power-efficient tasks, so not all four work at the same time. Although the performance is noticeably faster than the A8 in the iPhone 6, but apps are not opened so much faster for my experience, as I have imagined. At Whatsapp, e.g. maybe the difference is 1/2 second. The A9 of the 6S should be even less difference. In the power-saving mode, the iphone 7 is still very fast, but you can tell the difference when launching apps (Pokemon Go needs a lot of power) already very much. I am therefore largely satisfied with the performance, but if there was no contract renewal I would not have had to change it. Price: The starting price of 760 € is far too high, in my opinion, for the fact that the device offers only 750p resolution. It has already noticed in the meantime, that even the variant with 128 GB of memory was temporarily offered for 666 €. This price is already justified, the price for the 32GB variant would also be about 110 ¬ lower or in my eyes would definitely have. The current price of about 500-550 € for a used 7ner would be in my opinion for a new device perfect. Positive GPS is quite inaccurate (seems to be a known problem of the 7 Series models) -AkKuleistung is not optimal- older headphones you can Conclusion: With the iPhone 7 you get a modern but extremely overpriced device, which scores with a few features but also has some weaknesses. As far as the price performance is concerned, the cell phone did not convince me. Although I can understand that one pays the brand name here. But with the price level you expect something more. And the difference to an older model like the 4s (built in 2012) is not that huge. Who does not depend on Apple products and does not necessarily need a cell phone as a status symbol, is better served with much cheaper Android phones.
7670	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Mathmos11880	5	Apple stop. Always my pleasure	2017-05-20	de	Apple stop. Fast, sure, great cam. Liquid system. Great display. Again and again ... Logical that the battery only one day, right? Nen Porsche also needs 15 liters per 100km and no one complains or how! And why do some people rate the price here? A Porsche also costs 70,000 euros, and? Say something. Quality costs nunmal. Sure, I can also drive a VW, you also come from A to B. All Apple products are great, but also expensive. It's so. And you get good money for a used one. Where does one have that? And why fingers away, as in the last review. Nonsense something. The product should be evaluated, not the delivery. Complaint and good.
7671	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	M.M.	5	Quality as always	2016-12-30	de	The iPhone 7 is for me the best device from Apple. Waterproof and fast in class. The display convinces and even 3D Touch has become more useful with this series. Touch ID has become incredibly fast, very rarely that it does not work. Workmanship is great and nothing else to complain about, the matte black is timeless and noble. No comparison to the diamond black which is already scratched after a few hours. We had Samsung and HTC here in the house and not only tried once, it's just nothing to Apple ran. It's easy to argue that Samsung and the others are in league with Apple, so I do not think so. My S3 always liked to go out and sometimes I did not notice that for hours, my wife's S3 had this "" Sudden Death "", the S3 mini of our kids regularly had a flat battery, a friend's kid has an S5 for Christmas Mini received, went on and off several times a day. I did not even have such a nonsense with Apple. In the whole family or circle of friends not even some people are aware of the fact that you can not work so "" freely "" with the iPhone. What should I fumble on a mobile phone or tinker s.System? The time you can better invest in other things than any program to be able to write where you have any effect on the mobile. Anyway, Apple can see everyone as he wants, I think Apple is great and the device does what it should, reliable and like a clockwork. And if something should be then it's just in the next Apple and Apple helps where they can. I really have no idea why so many people complain to Apple. My opinion here should not be anything against Samsung or HTC, we have just made our experiences, it should be an opinion for Apple. Samsung builds beautiful devices and many are satisfied, HTC too. We have made our experiences and just do not trust the two manufacturers anymore.
7672	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Stefano S.	4	Typically Apple	2017-01-16	de	Since I have a beautiful iPhone for a long period I finally decided to switch to the 7 and I have to say: I am satisfied. Although the iPhone 7 is not the best, biggest, and best-selling smartphone, Apple has never really done that. It is very convincing with the workmanship, the whole device feels very high. Despite the retina, the display is very sharp and even with the low RAM the device handles very well, as all these components are tuned to the smartphone. With the battery life, I'm just barely through the day, even here is air up. The new Homebutton is initially quite habituation-minded, but you feel it within a few hours as normal and a physical button feels unfamiliar. Now to the point of probably the most criticized is: The headphone jack. Personally, I've almost never missed it, because Bluetooth is good to compensate for that again and I approve the concept of a wireless device. I recommend to anyone who wants to buy the 128GB version, as this compensates for the enormous problem with the storage space. All in all I am quite satisfied with the iPhone 7. Why 4 stars and not 5? As I said the battery life and the high price have played here with me the decisive role.
7673	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Vivi	2	Worst interaction with IOS	2017-09-06	de	After almost a year now, I can finally explain myself able to write a reasonable review of the iPhone 7. It will certainly give some text. First: After my initial dislike of Apple years ago, I realized at some point that the products essential cleaner and problem-free than any other device on the market. For years I was very satisfied with my Apple devices. As far as the iPhone is concerned, I've never been so disappointed with an iPhone. I have had so many IPhones among all IOS versions but the iPhone 7 is a real disaster. Not because of some nonsense because of no jack connection, etc. --- People will move with the times and if you do not want it then just do not buy it. One also moves into an expensive apartment that you do not like and then just moans around. --- The problem is not even the hardware but definitely the software. From Apple, I've always been used to holding a product in my hands, which is fully mature. Meanwhile, this is far from the case. I own the iPhone 7 in rose gold with 128GB of memory, which is already an exchange product from Apple - but unfortunately also has the same Fehler.Zu beginning: I never had problems with Finding of mobile network etc. The sound is very nice, the display of the display is clean and pleasant, and the camera works perfectly - all things I can expect for as much money as I think. Now to the mistakes that Over time, I'm getting more and more annoyed and force myself to hard-reset the iphon almost every day. The IPhone had problems with Bluetooth from the start. Sometimes it connects, sometimes not (with different devices mind you). If you're lucky, there is a perfect connection, if not you have crashes every second and may be at the car radio, for example. Look forward to music that sounds only every second second. Both my first (purchased from release), as well as the exchange device makes (t) en this problem. Then: Unexpected snagging so that no action is possible for a minute. Neither display nor buttons react then. Also: Constantly crashing the most diverse apps. Some do not even start anymore. The battery runs incredibly fast even though it is not old and should actually last longer than before (I'm not a cell phone user and have a normal daily use - sometimes a WhatsApp message, sometimes Googling, sometimes on the Watch calendars or weather and occasionally write notes - depending on the day sometimes more and less use but not exaggerated) - Well the battery sometimes does not even hold until the evening and although I volllade.Updates lately also made without as of I'm set to hang on the charger?! Insufficient accuracy and function of the display ... and since the last IOS update constantly problems with the synchronization of emails (and as I said, it is far from my first iPhone, the usual setup errors or connection errors I exclude confidently) I have to get rid of how frustrating that is. I'm glad when I get my iphone 7 finally going on. Wait for the keynote from Apple to the iPhone 8. If I should like it and the budget does not blow up (which I assume, however) I will upgrade. If not, I'll downgrade and get a 6s, 6s or 5s again, which would be much better. Too bad I never thought I'd ever be able to give an Apple product only 2 stars. But there I have to stay objective, that is simply an impertinence I was never used to from Apple. I hope there will be a lot of improvement with the next models.
7674	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Amazon Kunde	1	Malfunction !! Do not buy it here !!	2017-05-06	de	The proximity sensor has failed sporadically. It was really annoying. Constantly presses any buttons when talking on the phone. I was then a few times at the Apple Store. The people are super nice and very competent. First, we tried to just re-set the phone without backup. Unfortunately without success. After that they changed the complete display within 2 hours !! Now it works fine. Buy it in the Apple Store. There you will be helped. They also help with setting up and everything.
7675	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Alexander	4	My best ever smartphone!	2016-10-08	de	This is my first iPhone. Before, I had 2 high-end Android devices for 4 years. Pricing is not much between Apple and other manufacturers. I opted for the iPhone 7 because it is a logical progression for me. Yes, the display may have a low resolution of 750p but in everyday life it does not bother and it does not even stand out. At first I thought I would miss the missing jack plug, which I do not do. The new Homebutton is extremely cool! Find that much better than the old buttons. (Have known the older iPhones own) 3D Touch works as usual. The camera is not the best on the market but it still convinced me! The iPhone can do it really well and that's what makes Apple so special. If you want a smartphone which is running really well should you reach for Apple. UPDATE: I had some problems with my iPhone then drove to the Apple Store Dusseldorf. The staff were very friendly and changed my device. Got a new one without any problems. The service from Apple is just awesome. Added some photos that have all been done in worse / difficult lighting conditions.
7676	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Wolfgang	4	Apart from the religious war ..........	2016-12-29	de	....... and of course the price I would like to comment on the iPhone 7: 1. WHY IPHONE After traveling to the Android world, I returned to the iPhone 2 years ago. Main reason: iOS runs (at least for me) without problems, fast and absolutely "" smooth "". Sure, you can set more Android and play around but I had no (even high-priced) Android devices that have really run long-term trouble-free. Something always happens at least once a month and of that I just had the channel full. Clearly iOS has many drawbacks as well, and iTunes is now a joke because of the operation, but the operating system is running smoothly and that was the main reason for me again an iPhone kaufen.2. DESIGNShon funny that Apple itself speaks of a "" all new iPhone "" and a new design. Apart from the new antenna design and the modified camera mount, the second speaker grille and the missing headphone jack at the bottom, the part looks just like the iPhone 6 / 6s. Is already an indictment to leave a design from 2014 almost unchanged.3. MISSING HEADPHONE CONNECTORApple is selling the headphone jack as particularly innovative because it promotes future technology. But what is the future technology? Bluetooth? Who wanted, could use the already with the older iPhones. And the Lightning connection? Sure, that is no longer analog and provides a prerequisite for better sound! But I simply do not want to spend a lot of money on wired headphones, which I can only use with the iPhone / iPad. Of course, the new MacBook Pro does not have a Lightning socket. I think it would take more space for a bigger Tactile engine.3. TACTILE ENGINESupper thing! You really have the impression that you really press the button. As wear-free as a mechanical button is a real progress4.CAMERA short: A dream especially in low-light. Although there are several tests that the camera of the Samsung S7 is even better, but I must confess to my shame: I am fully satisfied with this camera! The fact that now also an optical image stabilizer is installed, is just a great thing when filming! 5. DISPLAYMy God, what a mess of Apple - I thought. I was always satisfied with the displays of Apple although in contrast to some Android devices with 4K displays, the resolution offered by Apple despite the marketing technology great term "" retina display "" is almost poor. But what I did not think: the display is actually better! In particular, the color fidelity is great and it's fun to look at photos and movies. BATTERYBy the Apple, oh so much improved battery life I could not find. Sure, the Apple devices are pretty flat and that looks great too. And of course iOS needs less processor power and battery than Android. But a little less flat and for a better battery performance would not be bad. I come (though no power user) just over the day. And this "just" is not enough, dear Apple people. What good is the best-designed device for me when the battery gives up its spirit? 7. FASTBoah, what is this part fast! It's just fun! 8. CAPACITYGood decision from Apple to double the memory compared to its predecessor, especially when you film and photograph a lot. Only: The iPhone with 32GB is much slower than the iPhone with 128GB - should be on the memory controller. Suboptimal! And of course: No slot for a memory card, but that falls a little less with the increase in storage space. Security reasons? Maybe you should think about a good encryption of the memory card. that this can only be used together with the respective device.9. WAASERDICHT TO IP67Na finally, Apple! I do not want to dive with the part, but it calms down if contact with water does not kill the iPhone. But despite a very good protection against water, Apple excludes water damage in the warranty! Huh? Wat now? This is really superficial, Apple! No confidence in your own technology? At least I am very satisfied with the iPhone 7. And that is apart from the religious war between iPhone and Android disciples the main thing, right? Who does not put off the price (although Samsung and HTC are now almost on the same level) gets a good and mature smartphone (with some disadvantages and peculiarities). Therefore only 4 stars.
7677	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Mag. Antoni Mac Berlin	2	Strange pricing.	2017-06-08	de	Because I do not think that's right, the sales tax was not included in the price. I would not have bought the product with such suspicious conditions. Of course, legally everything is constructed correctly, because after a short "trial period" "I do not keep the iPhone, that is sell, I will suffer great losses here.
7678	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Denis	4	On the whole, satisfied	2016-12-18	de	I'm very happy with the iPhone it's very smooth the camera is also very good. What I do not like but good is the battery gives in if you have the phone for a while otherwise everything is great on the whole. Personally, I think for those who have an iPhone 6s should not switch to the 7 because it has only minime changes
7679	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Sandra Peters	1	Empty cardboard boxes	2017-07-20	de	In no case you should order here! The trouble is inevitable. I have tried to order an iPhone through two different providers three times, but every time there was no phone in the package !!!
7680	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Iris Albert	1	Attention!	2017-07-11	de	I also ordered the iPhone 7 through the provider Topprice 24 and read with horror in many reviews that the phone was missing in the package. That was too risky for me then. Then I canceled the phone, which unfortunately did not work. Therefore, I will refuse to accept tomorrow. I take the 1-star rating because I like all interested buyers u.U. Give a good tip: If you order the phone, it should be unpacked in the BEISEIN the delivery. This one is then insured, the content should be missing and you have no circumstances with a refund. To Iphon itself: class. I bought it today in the store and am thrilled.
7681	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Amazon Kunde	5	Linda Rue	2016-12-07	de	Mobile has arrived today and as always, I'm super satisfied with Apple! No comparison to the Samsung Note 3 that I had before. The Samsung was much slower and stopped constantly or shut down applications due to system errors. I'm glad to have an Iphone again have, because in Apple products you can always trust.
7682	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Ernest Grewe	1	In weak mobile network reception unusable!	2016-12-26	de	My wife has been using an iPhone 3GS so far and was very happy with it. After a few days of falling, the disc splintered, I thought it was time to treat her to a new smartphone. After a short discussion about the requirement profile, we decided on the iPhone 7, because according to various tests and user opinions it should have a better reception than the 5 or 6. (We can judge the comparatively bad reception performance of these devices quite well, since I have only the 5 and now use the 6) The delivery was Amazon-typical fast and easy, the look and feel of the new iPhone is perfect, the installation - as Apple usual - unproblematic and schnell.Aber then unfortunately the disillusionment came. We live on the Land and have gotten used to having a less than optimal network reception (whether D1, D2 ...). With the 3GS, my wife was able to make calls anywhere in the house and on the property without problems, with the new 7 Series this was no longer possible. Either looking for a position on the window, then there not move as possible or renounce on the phone ... both are not really useful alternative, if you have to use the phone for work almost continuously. Since my wife is also traveling a lot in rural areas, so anyway often has to struggle with weak network coverage, the iPhone 7 is unfortunately unusable for their purpose of use. What good is the ease of setup, the trouble-free networking with Outlook, the appointment coordination in the company or other gimmicks, if the rudimentary basic functions are not usable? For me it is incomprehensible that Apple does not manage it over device generations to get back an acceptable reception performance. Other manufacturers have the issue under control better and it just annoying when everyone around one can easily make phone calls or send messages and you sit with his noble phone on the dry ... Since phone in my opinion, still the essential function of a basic Is mobile phones, I can not award more than a star despite all the other positive features of this device, especially since Apple apparently this problem does not take seriously for years seriously! The iPhone 7 goes back to Amazon and the old 3 Series is repaired.
7683	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Jenny	1	I phone is missing	2017-06-29	de	I'm totally disappointed, the phone was not included. The packaging from Amazon was not damaged. The foil of the mobile phone packaging had been opened and the phone was removed. Very sad !!!!
7684	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	5	Fits ....	2016-11-13	de	The device is my second iPhone and does what it should! Runs great and feels great. Even the battery is great for an iPhone! One is informed before buying and therefore I do not understand the bad reviews here; people seem to be weird (buy an iPhone 7 even though it does not have the features they want: "" I want a 4 inch phone, man, why is the iPhone 7 so big "" ... "" they're getting bigger; hä? Apple since the iPhone 6 not ..). I find IOS better than these gushed androit systems, even if the back and forth copy and move files is cumbersome. Interestingly, all Android phones after 2 years look like junk and creak and knit. My last iPhone is now over four years old and the current operating system is still running well and the phone looks great. My Android friends need new devices every two years, I all 4! In the end, the Android / Apple dispute is not worth it. Then every van driver could argue with a sports car or SUV. Some still buy optics, some just for specifications and others for apps ... I've never been disappointed with iPhones / iPads. From the iMac / MacBookPro already; So I'm not an apple freak but the iPhone is alright :)
7685	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Technikfan	3	No significant changes compared to the Iphone 6s!	2017-02-24	de	First of all: The review is based in my case purely on the comparison to Iphone 6s. I have been using all generations of Iphones for years ... since there are Iphones. The jump from my Iphone 6s to the 7 was done "" almost by chance "", because I had to adjust my provider contracts currently. Actually, I was very satisfied with the 6s. Initially I was irritated by the sometimes significantly higher purchase price of the 7 Series compared to the 6. So I made myself smart, what brings the iPhone 7 to innovations compared to the 6s so. The higher price is explained by. Experts alone by the higher storage space. It should be noted that 32GB of storage space is not enough for me. Ideal for me was the 64s 64GB storage space. And here "" trick "" Apple completely "" refined: there are no 64GB in the Iphone 7. The next higher jump of 32GB is only possible on 128GB. Why storage space at Apple has been costing so much money for years, has never opened up to me, if I pursue zBdiedie price of SD cards. Now my impressions after 3 weeks of operation of the iPhone 7: - The case size is the 6s - Unfortunately had I procure new covers / covers, because the camera recess is larger at the 7th - In the battery performance has changed compared to the iPhone 6s nothing! - I perceive in any app that the reaction times / process times something in the Comparison to the 6s has changed! - Exciting were the camera enhancements that were mentioned everywhere. Here should be just a noticeable improvement in terms of Lowlight recordings done. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I do not see any improvements compared to the 6s, neither photos nor videos! - The new Homebutton brings me no added value. Conclusion: the Iphone 7 is the purest marketing gimmick! Opposite the Iphone 6s has changed almost nothing! The jump is not worth it! I will consider the next upgrade (then on Iphone 8) more carefully, if I upgrade at all. For me, this is Apple's purest "" money cutting "" at the moment.
7686	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Christoph F.	5	Great device!	2016-10-15	de	It's great, the camera and the home button have changed a bit! I love it ... It's even a bit bent!
7687	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	XXX	5	Perfektionismus	2016-10-02	de	My rating refers to the smartphone as such. Revolution and expectations have nothing to do with fitness as well as valuation. I kept coming back to Apple. Intuitive operation, software optimally tuned to hardware, reliability and security (statements from a lawyer, as many Android phones are cracked, at least more than Apple), absolute harmony between products also from Apple.Android, Windows has always disappointed me. Especially music or photo apps, there are always several apps for one. How so? No idea. Now the iPhone 7.Matt Black looks classy and different. Finally, the jack is gone, too old, has had its day. Wireless is the future. Had the 6S before. The battery now lasts 2 hours longer, charging too long. The camera has gotten better, looks mature. Splashing water and protected from stub. Nothing new compared to the competition, but super. Negative I notice that in iOS 10 the music app is totally bad. I liked better before. Straight operation like eg. Favorite title or random mode, I have not found today. Telephoning and communication with car, headphones and other devices easily and reliably. Operation is absolutely great. Touch ID is getting better integrated with the apps, and Force Touch is becoming more and more simplistic. For me, there are 4.99 stars. The deduction is for the music app in IOS 10, but think that will be solved soon or someone can tell me how the above works;)
7688	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	mario	5	Very good smartphone - rightly the number 1	2016-10-15	de	I have used the S4, S5 and also S6 edge from Samsung in recent years. Although I also use an iPad, I could never imagine getting an iPhone. With the devices from Samsung, the S4 and S5, I was very satisfied. Then the S6 came out and for me it was clear that the edge version will be my new device. Said and done. Now after 6 months of conclusion I am extremely disappointed with the S6 edge. I do not want to fix that on Samsung or the S6 edge as a whole. I want to relate it to the one device I had. Overheated device, system errors, extremely long repair times, etc. have now drawn the last nerve. So I am the dealer of my confidence in search of a smartphone. Here the S6, the S7 or even the iPhone was touted. Since I had not had good experiences with the S6 I reached for really long superior to the iPhone. Now a few days after the purchase, I have to honestly say that iPhone is really a big step ahead of the congruence.
7689	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Sead J.	1	If you buy Apple product, shop at a mafia!	2017-11-26	de	The worst and most criminal monopoly in the world, who have no respect for their customers. IPhone 7 + 128 gb, in the beginning everything was great, until I realized that the microphone was not working properly. No problem I thought, sent in and the service announces the display was broken and I would have to pay 200 € for a new one. It was a small scratch that did not bother me, I told you that I want a new microphone and no new display. Refused, sent back! Then to the store, spent the whole day there, who said they would like to do it but they have a lock on it that they could not do anything. So again called service and clarify the final, they are stubborn and do not want to swap my microphone. Man has to imagine that, you have an 800 ¬ expensive phone with which you can not call! The bad thing is you do not care about the customer. I have 4 Apple products and they do not think I can offer a solution. I also told you nicely that I will no longer use Apple and disconnect me from it. Thereupon some sarcastic remarks. So man loses customers. That was the last time I buy such items. I am now standing there with a cell phone that I can not tel. Apple does not care that a bit. I advise everyone to buy any device that is worth nothing to the customer!

7691	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Produkt-Tester	5	read! "" Detailed test	2017-09-25	de	I am very satisfied with the phone and therefore give 5 star design: Externally, the iPhone 7 resembles the iPhone 6S. Only the across the smartphone back-crossing antenna strips and the seated at the top of the headphone jack of the previous model are missing the new model to keep it water and Staubducht.The key arrangement is unchanged.Hardware: The make of the GPU of the Apple A10 know we do not yet - maybe it is an improved version PowerVR GT7600, which belongs to the Apple A9. The graphics performance of the iPhone 7 should be 50 percent higher than that of the A9. In addition, an M10 called motion processor for monitoring the sensors is part of the chipset, which has been extended to 2 GB in the iPhone 7 in the iPhone 7 Plus are the A10 SoC3 GB RAM to the side.

Insanity, eye-catching, especially battery life and Force Touch Home Button. Both nice optimizations, as well as the very well-optimized finally available in stereo speakers. All in all, it is like the Porsche 911er: Discreetly evolved, for me great companion. Performance, usability speak for themselves.

However, hardly any differences to the iPhone 6s. You should ask yourself if the change is worthwhile for you or not. Of course, from younger models from the 6 down the change for my side would be advisable. I'm just a contract extension to the iPhone 7 have changed, however, have only noted differences in the following points.- Camera slightly improved- Sensor Homebutten- Battery consumption easily redeuziertDonst no noticeable changes have happened.

7697	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Dimos	5	Super mobile phone	2016-09-18	de	It is running confidently. The device is one of the fastest devices I've ever had, before that I had a Samsung s6 edge and this only caused me problems. Of course, the rounded edges are nice to look at but also something so useless I have not had in a long time. Let alone the plastification of the pictures they seem very unnatural and funny. To the GB RAM I can only say that Apple perfectly adapted its phone to its software compared to the s6 edge, although this 4 gb but 2.5 are constantly in use so that the device has very little power. The iPhone 7 combines these things perfectly together and brings out what to get out is contrary to power hardware phones like Samsung Sony etc. The screen is very good in my opinion. And the fact that the 3.5 mm jack has disappeared bothers me, of course, this causes more wear and tear because of the on and unplug, but be honest who of you buys such a luxury mobile and has no 10 insurance for it? So I do not see any problem in that to be honest. By and large it is the best mobile phone currently on the market.
7698	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Andi	5	Very good upgrade	2016-09-21	de	I am very satisfied with the device after one week of use. The performance of various things is not to compare with my previous Galaxy S7. The screen is also much better in comparison. I do not like the unnatural colors of the Galaxy S7 at all. But probably in the eye of the beholder
7699	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	A	5	just perfect!	2017-03-21	de	Unbeatable price, fast and easy delivery, what else could you ask for? The iPhone works great, I'm glad that I ordered this way!
7700	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	1	Chris	2017-11-03	de	Unfortunately, little innovation. The fact that you can no longer paden the battery at the same time and listen to music with headphones is just as much a joke as the homebutton, which no longer recognizes moisture or light dirt on the finger and thus unlocks only after five failed Versucgen. So nothing for craftsmen or people who like to bathe. The third joke is the supposedly sapphire crystal, which of course is none. The iPhone has dropped me twice from low altitude and twice the display has jumped. Too bad.

7705	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	5	iPhone 7, worst decision	2016-12-12	de	So far, you could trust a new iPhone release. Since iPhone7 this is different. The iPhone7 differs in design and innovations little if any from the iPhone6, on the contrary, it is thicker and heavier. The changes are not tangible for a standard user, who eg. Topfotos wants anyway has a SLR camera, etc. The new iPhone7 is now waterproof, great, I'm probably going to go diving with it, I need it. For this reason, the speaker connection is missing now. Ie. while listening to music lug around another moronic cable. And that in the future I am switching to these stupid air pods is excluded. Shall I stick the Sh .. in the ears while jogging? I already regret that I switched to the iPhone7. And the besch ... Home button is a horror. The whole phone vibrates like a surprise egg. iPhone7 never again, sorry Apple, maybe next time again. And then only after extensive testing of the new release.

Photos do not have 4K quality. If you sit on the trash turns through. Then you are only spied out with Eiertunes. Ridiculous in order to load music onto the gurkophone, this is only possible with Eiertunes. Ridiculous !!!! The warranty of 1 year is also underground. Anyone who supports child labor here is sorry for me. For 1 million euro, I would buy no Eierphone. Since Samsung is 1000 times better in quality and service.IgitigitEIERPHONE NO THANKS
7708	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Baddie	3	No more	2016-10-02	de	Have this phone as a company phone. I was really very Apple fixed but that with the Lightning cable annoys me now so that I will pick up again immediately to mobile phones with miniusb. Because the loading edges of Apple are after 3 months mostly scrap. If you buy which one is it Russian Roulette because often it starts well and after 2 weeks error message comes with not certified. Now also missing the latch.
7709	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	alex	1	Diamond Black = disaster !!	2016-10-26	de	I got the iPhone 7 in diamond black and was also enthusiastic about the design, but come after almost every little touch fine scratches to .. Use it now only a week even with a shell and the Iphone has a lot of scratches on the back. Not recommended had many Iphones before and none of them had only a scratch. disappointed
7710	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Kuto38	1	Disappointed	2017-05-01	de	So the only positive: Good system and liquid Ablauf.Negatives: Price / performance is right Nothing support is not thought out-> is your phone broken or it is no longer on, sends you the support a confirmation code on the phone, so that further steps can be initiated , But the phone is broken and then how do you have this confirmation code have not at all.You have to go to an Aplle Store suburb, wait several hours and then come the next day with an appointment. Well, we all have enough free time for it? Take care that the battery NEVER gets really empty. Why? Yes that happened to me twice and 3 of my friends too. If you do not power the smartphone within the next 30min it is DEEP DOWNLOAD, well with everyone it is different, my colleague had it on stream 14h so it showed signs of life again has at the other about 20h and with me even over 35h. now 35h without a cell phone where everything is stored inside and you can reach without replacement cell phone anyone is shit! FOR A SMARTPHONE THAT HIGH CALIBERS SHOULD HAVE MAXIMUM 1-2 HOURS OF DURATION AND NOT DAMAGED 2 DAYS. The same happened to me Iphone 6 and I have directly bought an IPHONE 7 and lo and behold, the same problem. As if that were not enough, they arrive with their stupid safety. One can use his Apple ID nirgens because the whole time want to somehow code what was sent on the defect device. You will not get an appointment online without a ID in this store. My tip: do you buy this, never let the battery go empty, and buy iphone 6, because there is not a big unteschied. I used both and wasted money unnecessarily.
7711	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	LosSantosGamer	2	Really bad!	2016-09-19	de	Oh man ... Apple. Every year a new iPhone, but never 1 year with a technical revolution. The iPhone 6 had an HD display for the first time, at a time when other manufacturers like Sony have already worked on 4K Panel. I really liked the design back then. An iPhone, which consists entirely of aluminum, except the front, was a house number. Only the antenna strips ... what are they for? LG does not need something like that, Sony does not need something like that, even Samsung did not need something up to the S5 and it does not look good either. So there was a lot that Apple could have improved on the iPhone 7. Now it's here! And it's a huge disappointment. I do not expect a revolutionary smartphone every year, but the iPhone 7 has nothing new to offer that other companies have not had. The display once again resolves to 1280x750p. In addition, it is as usual only 4.7 inches tall. Since the sharpness has not changed. What was improved are the colors, but I liked the iPhone 6 very well. But by the fact that Apple made the colors again more intense, the display of the iPhone 7 seems oversaturated. Similar to the Samsung Galaxy S4. Black and white balance against alright. Especially white has succeeded. But the colors are too thick. As for the pixels, you can not compare it to a Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which I tested at the IFA and has the best display on offer. The panel of the iPhone 7 is pixelated and out of focus. Even the Galaxy S3 convinces thanks to the S-AMOLED technology in spite of lower resolution more than the iPhone 7 In terms of processing and design Apple was already in first place and the word "" was "" applies today, because the design like not me at all. Hardly a trace that it is the 8th (?) Generation. From the front, it is identical to the iPhone 6s and only the rear is a difference noticeable. The antenna strips have now been moved upwards to get a nicer back. But it does not look much better than its predecessor. But a nice selection has been added, because you can now choose between matte black and piano black and both looks classy. The battery is typically not changeable Apple and the memory expansion is missing as always. There are now 32, 128 and 256GB available. The SD card slot is missing as with any Apple iPhone. But at 256GB you need no Speichererweiterung.Der battery has a capacity of 1960 mAh, which sounds like extremely little and is so. I was allowed to test the iPhone 7 so far 1 week and in these 7 days I had to charge the smartphone 10x. And that's just too much.When the device came back to me, I had to charge it twice the next day! Example: For the Huawei P9, I only had to load 1x the next time and then every 2-3 days. And after the battery life was fully utilized, it kept half a day of moderate use. Honestly, at not even 2000 mAh, I expected no other result. The main camera resolves with 12MP. The pictures in daylight excellent. Sharpness, color, dynamic range ... everything really top. In dim light, the images become blurred and there are fewer details that turn into image graining in the dark. However, the pictures are still usable at night. To the camera of the Samsung Galaxy S7 does not approach the iPhone. The video recordings are in spite of image stabilization z.T. very shaky and in videos also grain in shadow corners is minimal recognizable. The microphone, which automatically activates video, is a disaster. Noise, sometimes too bright, sometimes too dull. Bass does not exist at all and a slight crack is heard in minimal wind. Apple advertises the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with the hitherto fastest smartphone. Of course, only since the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was taken out of the sale due to explosion hazard. And I have to say that I really like the performance here. Apps start and close almost in record time. In addition, iOS 10 once again tidier. At least I barely discovered Bloadware. Very good Apple! Generally, the performance is the best you can find on the iPhone 7. Unfortunately, the device gets hot relatively quickly, so often the camera is not activated. But fortunately this is very rare auf.A special features are not so much. 3D touch, fingerprint sensor and 3.5mm jack plug removed. For this, Apple has included headphones with cables, but with an adapter to plug them into the USB C port. Sounds contradictory and it is like that. It seems to me that Apple itself does not believe in their Bluetooth headphones.3D Touch works the same way as the iPhone 6s, but I never used 3D Touch. In addition, the iPhone 7 IP67 certified, so protected against dust and water. In the test, the waterproof worked well, but this feature is also not new. In conclusion, the iPhone 7 is not a really good smartphone. It has positive things like the big memory, the waterproof and the great performance, but the battery is not good and the display for the year 2016 is too pixelated. But I think that iPhone 7 Plus can do better. And if the imense price of more than 1000 € for the 256 GB version was even lower, the iPhone 7 would still have earned 3 stars. But that leaves 2 stars left.

With the headphones, the phone call is so pleasant that the called often does not even hear that I'm in the car. Thus, for professional frequent travelers - and not suitable Telefon.Update - after one year in use, the battery hardly an hour. No wonder, Apple simply turns off disabled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

7724	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	mario bösl	1	rubbish	2016-09-19	de	Apple is and will remain the world's most expensive scrap in the trash, regret having bought this scrap, I'm staying with my Samsung, Apple scrap will be sent back
7725	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	pkmalta	5	Works as it should ...	2018-09-03	de	Had several such devices and have now purchased this for a friend who is very excited. It is, as with other APPLE devices as well as a sophisticated fine technology, which unfortunately has its price. However, considering that the system will be updated accordingly and the associated technical standard of this phone, then it is clear again that here a premium device does its job. Even if it is not the newest technology, these functions and the speed of the device are certainly enough for the normal user. If you are looking for a device that is not really outdated and at the same time meets the technical standards, then this is probably the place to be.
7726	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Erny	5	IPhone 7 impressed	2019-03-25	de	I have decided for a long time now for the iPhone 7 and me against the iPhone X.My reasons why I keep the iPhone 7 and have returned the iPhone X are the following: Better brighter color rich display without yellowing. This actually bothered me the most on the iPhone X. As soon as you tilted the screen a bit, the display color went from bluish to yellowish. And yes Truetone was disabled! At this price I could not make friends with this highly acclaimed Super Amoled. It annoys immensely that this yellow shimmer is always visible. The iPhone 7 has a fantastic camera, a super battery, lies well in the hand, looks chic and is first-class processed. The speed and features of this Samrtphone at this price are unbeatable. I am very satisfied and can recommend this IPhone unrestricted further. The iPhone was originally welded and new! Sale and shipping by Amazon.
7727	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Gregorina	1	iphone is finally not working and seller is not responding	2018-11-06	de	I bought this iphone and immediately it was not working, upon a contact with the seller, he exchanged for another new one.  That one had faulty speakers and I went to apple for warranty, they changed the whole front panel.  Few months later I noticed that speakers were again down and went to apple again, this time apple exchanged for the whole new iphone, which again did not work from the start but unfortunately one year warranty by Apple expired.EU directive imposed a two-year warranty period in the EU and if if manufacturers warranty is limited to one year, the seller should be responsible.  This iphone is a bit older that a year, I tried to contact the seller few times, Amazon customer services contacted seller twice, this seller ignore all.I will have to deal with Amazon now, because it is set by law that there is a two year warranty for products sold in the EU, especially for such costly ones.As for apple... I somehow think that minor retail shops get unsuccessful batches of apple products (lets say the ones that apple cannot expect for sure that all the manufacturing conditions have been fulfilled in a full form).This is my first problem with apple products among iphones, ipads and macbooks but I also never bought before through internet.  I guess not worth it!
7728	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Budala	5	I do not go back	2019-03-25	de	This is my third iphone now and I'm not going to get Android anymore. It's just a nice design, a super picture resolution and a very high-quality mobile phone, which suffers very little loss of value. So it can, even if you buy a new yet sold at a fair price and pleased by its longevity and other users . Only the price is a shortcoming for me at Apple. But you can not change that.

For the time being I had some jitters that it might not be an original Apple Iphone yet unpacked to look and it was a NAIL NEW WASHED AND ORIGINAL PACKED IPHONE 7 inside. Thanks to the serial number, it was also possible to see in Google whether this is an original Iphone! The price was great and we are still satisfied today! Battery performance is great, enough memory, you can only say that it is worth it! Of course you can also make a mistake

7746	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	S. G.	5	Nice thing :-)	2018-03-05	de	Already had the iPhone 4, 5 and SE as a business phone and I'm always very satisfied. The hardware has always kept much longer than my previous phones. Well, the software does not pack the iOS updates at some point, so that you need a new one after 3-4 years ;-). I know the iPhone 7 from some colleagues and acquaintances and always thought it was very chic because it was so flat. So I've got it private now. Although I was afraid that for my relatively small hands the decisive milimeters would be too wide, so that I can not hold and type in one hand anymore, but it works :-) The functions have been familiar to me and the tips App gets to know new ones too. The camera is awesome! Something stupid is that the charging cable and the headphones must be plugged into the same socket. Charge at the same time and make calls via headphones is therefore not with the included equipment. All in all, I'm really happy with the part :-)

I've been thinking for a long time about buying the 7 Series for the iPhone 5 or waiting for the current version. I was mainly interested in the 128 GB of memory available in this device. Here I had the 5er capacity problems. Of course that's a nice thing. About the remaining super features of the iPhone, there is little to report because everyone who once had such a device no other desires. The dealer is recommended because even on questions and requests promptly reacted. I also have no better offer than found here. I would have also given 6 points here. Anytime gladly again.

After 15 months it turns out at a pending display repair, the device has ever gotten a new display. Because the attachment was damaged, repair is no longer possible. Under "like new" I understand something else. A pity, that's untrustworthy.
7763	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Kundin aus Köln	5	Super Smartphone	2017-11-15	de	I was skeptical at first because the price was so cheap, but it was all right. Delivery was with UPS and the cell phone arrived undamaged. I had only Android phones before and was just curious. It was worth it and I'm probably one of the few that likes both Apple and Android. Very easy to use, the camera is great and it is waterproof. I would not try taking underwater shots now. The sound quality is first class and otherwise the quality is good. And thanks to the silicone shell and bulletproof glass foil which I bought extra, it has already survived several crashes unscathed.
7764	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Hannes	5	The phone itself was great, it had to return nevertheless ....	2017-01-01	de	I do not need to say much about the iPhone 7 ... just great! Nevertheless, I had to return the phone because the version I ordered in Austria did not work. Nothing was mentioned by the provider, especially since the shipping to Austria was also offered. After unpacking the mobile phone, I had the first (negative) Aha moment. There was no EU plug, but the power plug for the US ..... this was not the main problem. IPhone 7 charged (of course, with a "" normal "" plug for Austria), Austrian SIM card inserted, go through the first part of the registration on the iPhone, Game over! SIM card is not recognized. Then tried several Austrian SIM cards, unfortunately no success. Because of this, I had to understand slowly now that this sold and offered version of the iPhone 7 does not work for EUROPE. The Amazon support contacted, problem described, order no. communicated, and recognized the local hotline lady also immediately that the offered version passed on any information to the customers that it is a pure US iPhone 7. Returns are accepted immediately, and credit is made. Have a European version - and all Tip Top! Thank you Amazon for this great transaction within 4 days.
7765	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Kokosnuss	5	As always great, only with slight habituation problems.	2018-02-15	de	I bought the iPhone 7 with 128 GB purchased as a retreaded product. It looks like new! To the iPhone itself, everything has already been said, I try to supplement: since I once again skipped a few models (previously had the 5S) I had to get used to something in terms of operation. The now-side lock button causes the phone, I always accidentally turn off, although I only want to carry it through the area. But only as a small anecdote. Can you get used to it? Touch ID is much better than the 5S. However, you have to be careful that you do not unintentionally unlock the phone in your pocket. Luxury problem. The phone is very fast, so far there has been no dropouts and it is running very stable overall. It is great in the hand, where I recommend a sheath to people with smaller hands, otherwise it can slip out of the hand due to the smooth surface sometimes times. Top product!
7766	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	senator996	5	Proven Apple quality	2017-07-05	de	Proven Apple quality, no negative surprises. Acquisition of the data from the old iPhone 6 also worked very well. The only drawback was a Hermesbote, pretending not to find our address, which delayed the delivery by one day. That would not have happened with Navi.
7767	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Claudia G.	5	iPhone 7 from Planet-Online2015	2018-01-12	de	I bought the 32GB iPhone 7 in matte black from Planet-Online2015, which was described as new and ovp. The description was 100%: The iPhone was unopened, the packaging contents completely. Having already read horror reviews about other sellers, I would like to make a very clear recommendation for the dealer! Before the final payment, I was also advised that the invoice is shown after differential taxation without VAT - who should have something against it, so can still withdraw before completing the order process of it. To the iPhone itself has already been said a lot, I can only to add my personal experience: After I skipped some iOS versions - my last iPhone was the 3GS with iOS 6, which has accompanied me for four years - I found myself in iOS 11 very quickly and I am after longer trips to BlackBerry and Samsung, which also have their advantages, but also clear disadvantages / bugs, (again) really excited: The phone is very fast, there was no dropouts and it is running very stable overall. For me, the purchase was definitely worth it! Although the price is not a cardboard handle, but I'm sure to have a phone for it, of which I will have something for the next few years, instead of having to buy another after just 2 years already another.
7768	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	DanLan	4	iPhone	2018-02-14	de	Very nice iPhone. The usual Apple features and the beautiful design make it a grds. great mobile phone. As usual, it eats from Apple, so the compatibility with non-Apple devices is limited, but you just have to know that. In addition, the price is gross. too high, but if you want Apple, you have to pay for it (even if Apple does not mean better quality from its own experience). On the positive side, the Home Button on the iPhone 7 is not a real button (which is often broken in other iPhones). However, it is really negative to judge that the iPhone 7 has no jack connection. In my opinion, you can not do without it at the moment. Although an adapter (Lightning on jack) is included, but this one must always have it and since it is relatively small, the risk of losing it is very high. Therefore all in all 4 stars.
7769	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Oliver	5	Another great iPhone. Incredibly fast processor. Great looks and mega storage space (128 GB)	2016-12-09	de	Certainly the best iPhone ever. Definitely the fastest. It's just fun on the internet, taking photos, editing e-mails etc. The new Home Button works wonderfully and recognizes fingerprints very reliably and fast. Definitely better than the 6s and, above all, much faster. For me, the most natural color reproduction of all smart phones in terms of display and photography. I am very pleased.

7771	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Katja	1	Attention: No connection on this seller line	2017-11-07	de	The iPhone 7 is perfect in my view - except for a trifle: phoning does not work. According to my research on the internet, it turns out that some (maybe a batch) has catastrophic voice quality. I am not to be understood in the approach for my interlocutor. Noise, background noise, choppy, etc. The seller, I have been written several times> no answer. The iPhone 7 is therefore a gamble. It may be that you are lucky and get a usable model. One thing I can say but: with this provider, there is no service. Not even an answer!

Habs 2018 bought although it came out in 2016 but the software is cutting-edge and the performance is convincing. Unthinkable for Android smartphones. Habs on eBay as new purchased from the dealer and clearly compared. saved the Apple original price. Battery life leaves something to be desired. Size is marginally large, so it can be just one-handed use with an average sized hand - it's a great pity that the new iPhones 2018 are all even bigger.
7774	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Valentin Wittmann	5	Good iPhone	2018-08-19	de	The iPhone 7 is in itself a good mobile phone. 1 star deduction because it bothers me, that z. B. can not separately set the alarm clock to quiet. The volume can only be adjusted to the complete mobile phone. Sometimes you want to hear the message tones quietly but the ringtone loudly. This is not possible. For WhatsApp there are only 1 standard ringtone, no selection as in Android. It is already a change from Android to iPhone. I do not know yet if I would order it again. What's great is the crisp picture. I use the iPhone for about 1 year.

7779	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Trinity	2	IOS 11	2018-09-04	de	My review is limited to IOS 11.I want and can not understand what this unnecessary management of wireless and Bluetooth connections should be in the control center, if I want to turn off the connection to my Wi-Fi hotspot, then I want the connection completely interrupted and not something between. I do not want to have to navigate in the settings for each time to then turn off the wireless or Bluetooth module, why Apple says that everyone who owns an iPhone, even in possession of an Apple Watch, Instant Hotspot or superfluous styleless Apple Pencil is for which that functionality was introduced in the control center.

7781	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Judith	5	I like it;)	2017-02-16	de	So after 6 happy years I switched to iphone 7 with my iphone 4. Sure, I'm first thrilled by the speed of my new phone;) It should be noted that my iphone 4 had no quirks after six years of intensive use, despite several beach holidays and a few falls with shell, it was only mitlerweile really slow. ... I hope this iphone will last for a similar amount of time. I hesitated for a long time, because I find the new design idiom of the iphones unfortunately a little sightless. The 4 and 5 had just more profile .... But good, but the screen is now larger and the photos and videos look gigantic, with the current resolution. Great toy! Only at Siri you can complain about something, you can not even recommend a restaurant for a business lunch, you have to do everything yourself .... is not that bad either;)
7782	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Kunde	1	Does not work in Germany	2018-04-26	de	Unfortunately, I had the same problem as another writer. The used cell phone itself was in good condition and with complete accessories. However, the phone is produced for England and does not work in Germany. This was not mentioned in the device description. It is also the Apple Store not possible to switch this device for Germany. Schade.Viel running for nothing.

The software is self-explanatory and largely immune to crashes. Viruses are there as good as no.Kamera and remaining hardware top. Apps must be shared by Apple - so they all work fine, but not for free. I would grab an iPhone again at any time.

The display may be slightly better / sharper on Samsung, but you will not notice this in use ... is ultimately just a date that is on paper.
7785	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Tommy	5	An iPhone is just an iPhone	2017-07-05	de	What do you expect, it's just like the 6s, but there are small differences. The operating system OS is not version 9 but 10, so safer, more modern and the update capability longer. Also because here are still improvements to be developed, who knows what you understand a roadmap operating system. Furthermore, here is a QuadCore installed as a processor, which is also fast and more modern technology. So here are still plenty of reserves available. I can only recommend the iPhone 7.

The camera shoots good pictures in daylight, and the speed of opening apps has also convinced me if one of those fun is worth so much money ... then everyone has to decide for themselves.

In my opinion build quality and industrial design of iPhone 7 is head above Google Pixel and 2 heads above Galaxy S7.I haven't used all the Android customizations (launchers, widgets, etc.) so this is not a problem for me in IOSI also haven't used headphones with my old phone for ages, so lack of 3.5mm jack is not an issue as well.Pros:* Build quality, materials, design* On average 5 years of IOS updates support versus 2-3 years for Android / Nexus* Haptic engine is awesome* 3D Touch is much more usefull than I initially thought it will be* Love Live Photos* Battery life way better

7794	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	A.S.	4	Expensive, but good.	2017-04-19	de	Had a long SAMSUNG Galaxy SII. Have not regretted the choice of the iPhone 7. Very long battery life, good memory management and easy operation. Could easily use the iCloud family feature to share appointments, notes, photos and other data with my wife's iPad. We use this feature extensively and are always well informed. The photos with the iPhone are indistinguishable from a normal digital camera. The Panorama Funtion also offers good opportunities. All settings, installation of apps, WLAN and Bluetooth works perfectly. E-mailbox setup was also easy. Since an Apple is different from the rest, no matter what you touch, it works. The only criticism is the high price. Can recommend the purchase of an iPhone 7 but still only.

I charge after 2 days- Front & Rear Cameras with image stabilization- Waterproof- 3D Touch- Finger Print scanner allowed many Apple Apps to use fingerprint for secured access- Lightweight & thin

7800	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon-Kunde	5	Good iPhone, especially the now home button	2017-01-05	de	I changed from the iPhone 5S to the 7, because I had problems with the home button on other devices. The advantage of the 7ers is that there is no physical home button anymore. A (relatively) strong vibration feedback simulates but a keystroke, which actually works well. For me, the feedback could be even more intense (in the settings you can choose between 3 levels).
7801	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Schadi	5	All good	2017-03-18	de	I bought the iPhone for my son, it was delivered on time, but since it is only a few days old I can not say anything about functionality
7802	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	M. Föhr	5	Absolutely convincing	2017-12-03	de	Now almost 10 years Android, I had the nose now quite full. The devices are totally littered, updates come only a limited time and a reasonable backup is virtually impossible without root. Last time I had the S7 and was actually satisfied. Now a new one should come. However, there is currently not really an Android device which would have moved me to 100 percent to buy. The coincidence, it was probably so that I was able to acquire very good conditions a 6S used. Initially I wanted to knock the part after setting up only in the bin. However, I read a lot about iOS and also watched a few videos. After 2 weeks I realized that I did not want anything else. So I bought the iPhone 7 with 128gb and the 6S left to my daughter who is absolutely happy now. The reasons why I am new despite the 8 and the 10 have specifically decided for the 7, are the following: - 128gb memory (there are no longer the new) - metal housing (after 2 years Samsung with glass back I was fed up with it too) - a chip that will be in the future long enough Updates can get - the very successful optics update on iOS 11.2 (significant improvement in battery life) - very good camera - cheaper price - water and dust protectedI think I will keep this device now only a few years. Much of Apple just goes better. Once you get used to iOS, you notice the benefits very quickly.
7803	iPhone 7	128GB	Gold	Uwe P	2	Bad reception in the GSM area	2017-03-22	de	Actually, the iPhone 7 should replace my iPhone 4S. But unfortunately, nothing came of it. The device went back to Amazon today. Because of the miserable reception in the GSM area. (D2 network Vodafone with me). I live in an area with unfortunately weak mobile network expansion. Where I have with the 4S 2 reception bar, it fluctuates with the iPhone 7 between network search and 1 reception bar. Telephone calls without disconnection are unfortunately hardly possible with the iPhone 7 here. After more than 1 hour of extensive consultation and some checks with the Apple Support, the recommendation was made to send the device back. Since the technical checks of the support could not detect a fault with the device, it seems A reception increase by future software updates is unlikely and I can not guarantee synonymous Apple, so returns. In areas with weak network expansion, I can not recommend the iPhone 7! Where a good network expansion It may work. I have now ordered a 6S, which, according to Apple Support, should not have the problems.
7804	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Martin Kofler	5	Everything OK	2017-01-24	de	The iPhone was original packaging, fast delivery, the iPhone is open for all cards and accepted without problems from my network. Thanks to the company man can only recommend weider

One can argue about the qualities and characteristics of the iPhone, but they are well known and will not be mentioned again. An original invoice with VAT card was bei.Für the price in any case recommendable;)
7806	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Marc	5	iPhone 7 Matte Black, 32GB	2017-02-21	de	I switched from the S7 Edge to the iPhone 7. The mobile phones that I had owned from Apple can be counted on one hand (3GS, 4S, 6). Otherwise, Android always remained faithful. As a longtime and extremely satisfied Anrdoid user (there was a little trip to Apple when the iPhone 6 came out) I severed my S7 Edge with a heavy heart to fish in strange waters. To date, I had mostly flagships on which Google's OS lief.The iPhone 7 differs only partially from the iPhone 6 / s in terms of design - but I greet it very much that this time there is a completely black color, without the gray back. The matte black is relatively insensitive to fingerprints and (still) scratchy. By design, I find the iPhone simple but modern. No mega camera collection on the back such as the G5 LG or similar. Devices. I just like it when it's clean and simple - but that's a matter of taste. The fingerprint sensor, which lies under the Froce-Touch homebutton, responds very quickly and accurately. The homebutton actually feels like a real button. I could never imagine that before I had it in my hand. Apart from the design, however, the biggest point of getting used to was the operating system. As an Android user I was used to being able to change EVERYTHING. Alternative Tastauren, Launcher, Themes, Custom Roms, etc. This is unfortunately not so. Apple develops a smartphone with the iPhone, which the user takes as much as possible. There are hardly any possibilities to change even more than the background. But what really stands out positively is that it runs totally smoothly. The A10 Fusion, which is "just" a quad-core (the competition already uses Octacore processors in mid-range smartphones). I have not noticed any hangovers or delays yet. Really, great tuned OS !! (For converters, however, took some getting used to). However, there are some points that I would call "" negative points "". Yes, you read yourself before you buy such a device and yes, you have to compromise, because you can not have everything ... but I think there are some important features, such as. a notification LED, the ability to personalize your device, Quick Charge and Qi Charge. These things can already be found today in the 200 € segment. But yes, as you know it from Apple and anyone who buys such a device, knows that he makes compromises. The camera makes good pictures, as far as I can judge that as a photo layman. Force Touch is a cool gimmick, What I did not know before buying the iPhone. Missing jack does not bother me personally. Despite all that is missing, I am extremely surprised by the iPhone 7. Google apps are easy to install, which worried me a lot. Despite the lack of features, which are in the end only nice-to-have, I give here 5 stars, because I am very satisfied with this device. Yes, the device is expensive, that was never different with Apple and yes, one also pays for the name, but one must not forget that Apple supplies here a 1a device, which drives around in the Top 3 of most Benchmarks.Kaufempfehlung for all, who would like simply simple, simple and simple.No purchase recommendation for all , who attach great importance to individualization and are eager to experiment.
7807	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	viggor	5	Works like a charm	2017-03-02	de	iPhone 7 is a good product, glad I bought it. and this transaction was protected by amazon, but worked without any problems.
7808	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	Axel	4	Everything super - only as a phone with light and shadow	2017-01-17	de	First of all, the iPhone 7 is an iPhone and thus a device that is difficult to compare because bare data and benchmarks are meaningless in this optimally hardware-based operating system. Even with 4 instead of 8 cores and 2 instead of 4 or more GB Ram runs the iPhone in terms of speed. Fantastic! What I noticed otherwise positive or, compared with previous models has been improved: + Camera, finally with optical image stabilizer and bright aperture. Not the best camera on the market, but the differences to a Galaxy S7 or Google Pixel are often a matter of opinion or hardly recognizable to the layman. A very useful always-on camera + working speed is great, although the 32 GB variants are indeed slower / should be as the 128 or 256 GB. One does not notice, everything runs smoothly. Ruckler practically never exists. + IOS 10: Finally more widgets, more quick settings + 3D Touch: Great, I use this a lot and since the iPhone 6s introduced this technique, there are now plenty of apps offering this contextual feature + Audio quality : Both as a speaker (STEREO!) And with headphones or via Bluetooth to an external device: The sound is always very good to excellent. I had previously the LG G4, which had a terrific camera, but the video shoot or music playback sound had so disappointed. This is not the case here. Super. I work as a journalist and no longer take my digital recording device with me, have even given audio tracks to radio colleagues, was suitable for broadcasting. + VIDEOS: The video quality is the best I have seen in a smartphone so far. It's unbelievable how shake-free you can film how good the sound is + Apps: Since Apple's Appstore is still the toughest developer app, many apps I've previously used on Android are a little better in detail, faster, more precise or fall-proof. Ex: Under Android often crashes in track recording despite potent hardware. Here everything always immediately usable and exactly + GPS: My LG G4 jogging me at a total of 6 kilometers of track always at least 500 meters "" stolen "". The iPhone is as accurate as the GPS in the car (which was the winner of the test). So jogging or tracking is fun! These points are to be evaluated neutral, because they are not negative in the evaluation, but are also not great. I'm sure not the first one who is upset about it, but until you get the content from the computer to the Pulling iPhone you want takes hours, because you often either sync everything or nothing until you see how that works. Or. Yes, you know it before and calms down when buying with the supposedly good resale value, but still you get for an iPhone two washing machines in the equivalent. Krass. But you buy one then. In this respect...o Ecosystem Apple: No dragging and dropping of files - that's also known before, also that you do not make songs into ringtones and other customizations. And yet, everything also has a benefit: iOS is not as sensitive as Android for a long time. I notice that after a few weeks. Blessing and curse at the same time. Finally, the iPhone 7 is a very good, but not a perfect smartphone and therefore it has two negative points, which cost in my rating a star altogether The iPhone breaks more than all the phones that I had before , Talks or breaks connections, even in the city in best reception. I do not know why. An update and a visit to the Applestore have done nothing, nor the exchange of the sim card. It is striking that in between a week goes well and then can be very bad again. I observe this and write here, if necessary, an update, if the software should improve this at some point. It's definitely annoying because this is the basic function of a cellphone. And I feel reminded of the iPhone 4 and 5, which were similarly bad for telephoning.- The SAR value: Just because the iPhone 7 is so bad to talk on the phone, it is even more amazing and annoying that the phone has such a strong radiation value of more than 1.3 w / kg. The Samsung Galaxy S7 radiates less than a third as strong and has a very good cell phone reception after tests. Why, Apple? Since I usually use the phone via headset for telephoning, I personally do not worry about it, but basically questioning this is already.- Sound via headphones: Due to the omission of the jack connector, you can almost only hear about the digital Lightning Output or via adapter, if you want to hear with cable. The omission does not bother me, but probably the quality. The sound is still loud enough and very clear, but compared to the iPhone 6 or 6s, the basses have disappeared. Very middle and high altitude sound. Crystal clear, but it lacks the bang through the bass. Too bad. Altogether still neat, but for 700 Euro ... CONCLUSION: The iPhone 7 is the best smartphone that I know, but still does not deserve 5 stars, because it can not be fully recommended as a phone and for a smartphone in 2017 one has too high a radiation value.
7809	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	MIR	5	The perfect business support + UPDATE August 2018	2017-08-25	de	I use my I Phone 7 now for almost 9 months professional, about my impressions and experiences, I would like to briefly report here a little bit. That I Phone smartphones are not particularly reliable should be known, I am in the handling because it is not my phone, but asked by my employer was very careful in dealing. This is not true for all my colleagues, here there were already some display damage. Unlike Samsung phones, in my opinion, the sensitivity is very high. I therefore recommend using the I Phone in conjunction with a protective cover (best Flip Case). Now for the I Phone itself. I am very impressed by the workmanship and the high-quality feel. The phone is built very narrow, yet it fits well in the hand. The battery keeps me just under 4 days. The camera makes super sharp images and the sound through headphones or speakers is outstanding. What I like about I-Phone better than many Android devices is that more apps are available u.a. Sky go. Incidentally, I privately use a Sony Ericsson Xperia Z 1 (I have already rated it here). I am fortunate enough to be able to work with an I Mac and an I Pad in addition to my I Phone. The combination and interaction of the systems is a great way to make things easier, whether it's phoning, exchanging data or simply handling them. UPDATE August 2018I would like to add two more points. I use the I-Phone 7 now for almost 18 months and I'm still super satisfied, the battery in continuous operation (music), although unfortunately a little, but you can load it yes. Recently, the phone fell into the pool (was there about 5 minutes until I noticed it, water depth 1.50 m), while I noticed that it is waterproof;) In addition, I fell from 3 meters from the ladder, directly on the side where I plug in the good piece had, the phone went better than me afterwards. Therefore, the I Phone 7 is absolutely dub suitable! I am happy to answer any questions!
7810	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Andreas	5	Great, classy, ​​brilliant.	2017-03-18	de	Super, great Telefon.warum I have not already gained one before. Super, great. I can only recommend the phone. I changed from Android to IOS.
7811	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Wir packen aus	5	Very good iPhone but there is a lot of competition	2016-09-26	de	The iPhone 7 I was curious and again, unfortunately, there was not much new ... But some small changes are there like IP67 but why not IP68 as s.Samsung or Sony ?? But I do not want to do it badly, the iPhone has a lot of course good the camera is really first class pictures and videos can really be seen no matter whether the sun is shining or low light the pictures are super. The heavy mirror reflex can now also stay in the closet. For people who often use FaceTime the 7MP front camera is really Well. The new Homebutton here you get used to in seconds, a short firm pressure and you feel a vibration and it gives the feeling that you have a right button. The display is as usual Apple just a good 25% lighter to the old device yes, I can confirm and I think well just when the sun is shining and you can see what the 25% are already worth a lot. The sound finally Apple :) Speakers Stereo at the pages just as a gamer on the iPhone, you often come with your fingers on the speaker and hear nothing more that is now over. Sound is in my opinion even better than the HTCK jack no more so bad it is not the right cable is with it and sometimes can continue to use all the headphones, but the part is already small and I had to search for it after 2 days, and if it has to happen quickly it can happen that you can not find it so always best s.den headphones. New colors I have dull black and am satisfied with the Diamond Black I would be too afraid that it scratched quickly. Memory 32 GB 128 GB 256 GB yes these are already today sizes that you need just when an update comes or the next holiday, therefore, the bigger the better. Price Ok you want an iPhone and it costs clearly, there are other manufacturers, the good part, even better devices and only a fraction cost but if you have an iPhone it is difficult to separate and if you still have a Mac and iPad you should already invest the money. My conclusion: It is an iPhone like any other with a few good news and I think the change from my iPhone 5 to the iPhone 7 was really worth it. I have made a short unboxing video so you can see what's in the box so inside. Thanks for reading.
7812	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Terry14	5	128 GB matt black	2016-12-15	de	Come from the 5S, which I lost in the US. I then bought the 7 128 Gb, sim free, model A 1660 in Palo Alto. Model A 1660, because it has the faster Qualcomm modem. The device is very very good, the feel excellent, the material impression high quality; it is damn fast, and has a razor sharp and bright display - with the battery I come to 2 days (I'm not a player). The voice quality is i.O. in Internet telephony (eg via FaceTime) anyway brilliant. Also, the reception strength is better than that of my previous 5S. Bluetooth connection to the BMW hands-free is easy. The missing jack slot for the headphones has not bothered me so far, in contrast to the 5S is in my opinion even the sound quality on the new output better. (Tests have probably already confirmed this) quality of the photos absolutely OK; Focusing fast; good results even in the dark (always measured that we photograph here with a phone) Overall, the best iPhone that I ever had (previously 4S, 5S) and together with the Apple silicon case in navy an eye-catcher.IOS crashes so far: 0Habe the phone is now 3 weeks in operation, should soon be new things, I will tell this here.
7813	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Lukas S.	4	Apple as usual!	2017-08-20	de	Have the iPhone 7 now for quite some time and am always satisfied with Apple! Sure, the price is a house number and I can understand anyone who refuses to spend so much money on a cell phone. The UI, in my opinion, is simply the best on the market. Especially in connection with a MacBook, it is super easy to send files or synchronize with functions such as AirDrop. The camera is also a lonely top, especially the "" live photos "" always bring joy. I do not have to say much about the app store, with the reason why I always come back to Apple - just great. The size I like well, fits in any pocket and still you can relax Videos and Bilder.Leider I always have some problems with the nature of the display. One time, my phone fell to the floor, and of course a crack in the glass of the display was not enough. Of course, the phone is not made for easy crashes or the like, yet I had better experience with other providers. The iPhone still works perfectly, which is why I see no need to replace the display.
7814	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	The Reviewer	5	Sensational	2016-12-20	de	After the iP4, I made short trips to Windows Phone and Samsung Galaxy, now with iOS 10 and iP7 back to Apple. This phone is fantastic, iOS 10 is so well tuned that the operation is easier by dimensions than other systems, in the Compared to the cheap Android updates come quickly and you realize that a company behind it take care of it. The iPhone is really the best phone ever, the lack of KHBuchse was not a second a problem, in the car Bluetooth works perfectly.
7815	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Andrea	5	Everything's great, Apple.	2016-12-13	de	I do not understand the negative reviews. The iPhone 7 is a lot easier (you can compare) and the home button or the fingerprint scanner works flawlessly and corners more reliable and faster than Samsung Phones.Why I buy the new iPhone when the missing headphone connection bothers me? Is as incomprehensible to me as the fact that he is missing. There is an adapter, so where is the problem? And to all Samsung Lovers: also the next Samsung Galaxy comes without headphone jack. Back to the iPhone: top camera, super fast, no jerks, nice design, great 3D touch and the stereo Speakers also sound a lot better than the 6s. Also, the battery lasts much longer. I regret the purchase by no means, on the contrary. The best smartphone / iPhone I have ever had and 100% recommendation.
7816	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Usazz	3	I am very disappointed with the deteriorating quality	2017-06-06	de	Have to say the quality of Apple products is getting worse from model to model now pretty much every iPhone since the iphone 3 models also had the s models and i find it does not get better right now with the iPhone 7 i have very often trailer just on safari the battery ends up getting faster and faster in summer switch it all the time in the * your iPhone needs to cool down first * mode it pretty annoying !!!! Very disappointed
7817	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Nicolas	5	Upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone 7 is worth it	2016-09-29	de	I buy the new iPhone every two years. I like to think of it as the first thing in the world with the whole world. This year, unfortunately, o2 had so many delivery problems that I had to wait two weeks ... Now I have the iPhone here: Apple iPhone 7 Smartphone (11.9 cm (4.7 inches), 32GB internal memory, iOS 10) matte blackIf I held it in my hands, I was simply thrilled. It touches iPhone typically good. The workmanship is right! Apple like halt ... Packaging and Design: - The box is as always super chic in a white cardboard dress - The matte black looks super chic and the fat fingers can not see immediatelyFor more design impressions just watch the video! Product: Just if you before the Iphone 6 or worse in operation, you immediately notice the speed. Apps run much smoother and get started faster.Highlights: - It's waterproof! No kidding, I tested it too! Just make sure that you do not immediately connect it to a charger, but wait about 30 minutes for the Lightning connection to dry. Then you can load without hesitation.- No real home button more: The new home button makes you feel as if he would give in. but he does not. The lower part of the iPhone vibrates so that it looks like it is giving in. Great! - The camera is great too! A huge difference to the iPhone 6! Definitely try the live photos! Conclusion: I would recommend it unreservedly! Yes, it costs a lot of money, but it's worth it. I sell my old iPhone every two years, because the things are really stable. For questions, just post a comment. I would be very happy if you gave me a "" Yes "" for "" Was this review helpful? "" Leaves!
7818	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Avdulahi	5	iPhone 7	2016-12-23	de	Very stable mobile phone is very goodIn the hand fast access to apps very fast processor, I like the phone very well
7819	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Tech-Noir	4	Iss OK	2017-04-25	de	Had so far the 5s. Then I wanted the SE. Because of more memory and technology - is just inside newer - find the feel of a 4 inch really pretty good. I decided then for the 7, because the display is just a little clearer - use a lot of Navi. We do not need to talk about the price anymore - either you can do it and swallow it or leave it alone. I still pulled off one star, because headphones in Bluetooth could have been quiet instead of this dongle and cable; if already the socket for headphones is missing. Whether the cell phone - and how long - also works under water, others may test. I do not think anyone understands me underwater anyway.
7820	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	1	Only problems with the delivery	2017-08-19	de	I forgive a star for the delivery. The device could not be put into operation because it was supplied with the SIM Lock contrary to the description. The Apple Support could not help me, I should contact the network operator. In addition, no VAT could be issued for the goods - overall, I strongly advise against buying!
7821	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Pocketketchup	5	Fast faster the fastest	2017-03-09	de	Preliminary, I have not bought the product on Amazon.de.This is not a review that enumerates all the technical advantages, but my subjective opinion.I previously had only Samsung phones of the Galaxy series (S2, S4, S5, S6 and S7) and bin switched to the iPhone, because I have some Apple products in addition to the iPhone as the Apple TV, Ipod and especially a MacBook Pro. For these products, I've been very pleased with Apple's quality and support. In addition I had many problems with the Samsung mobile phones. 4 of the phones had Qualitative flaws that I could not live with. Therefore, I wanted to try the iphone. It should be said that I have the US version and it came to me Refurbishes. The phone is not an Android phone and I thought that myself the annoying setting for personal settings would be annoying, but I have to say that iphone is like my mac. It does exactly what it should and what I want to do is have it. At least once a week, I run to my friend and tell him what I've found for a new feature. This bothers me the often mentioned not existing back button. Since where you need the function there are back arrows and otherwise I'm faster on the home button anyway. I have synchronized my devices with each other, which was the most important decision criterion for me. Here, Apple can clearly points. Whether it is iMessage or Facetime everything is on both devices and the annoying back and forth copy is verschuwndenMein device was unfortunately already broken when I received it. Unfortunately, the microphone was broken, but Apple has its bomb service, it's almost up to Amazon I think, and I had very quickly now a brand new IPhone.Also the subjective opinion of an Apple disciple may not count for many, but I'm convinced of Apple and how many are: Once Apple, always Apple even if a piece is missing in the apple.
7822	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Erik Scherzinger	4	Super up to the battery	2017-04-27	de	Hello dear friends, I switched from an S7 Edge to the Iphone 7. The transition went smoothly and I had no problems at any time, since I have ever had an Iphone 5 and I have a little known. From the specs are both of course top. Everything absolutely "" high-end "". But what annoys me is the battery life of the iPhone. I've never had battery problems with the S7 Edge before and I've never been relaxed, comfortable and supple. In the case of Iphone 7, however, I'm always watching if I'm going to come by day. I am an intense user and have since gained a power bank, which saves me from this annoying battery problem. A little bigger battery ... then of course it would be awesome, drum deduction a star. Other manufacturers get synonymous with top terms and that with Android. Since "Apple" would "only" "maybe 200mAh drauflegen. With the software tuning perfectly to the hardware, this small boost would have a huge impact on runtimes. The battery would probably not be much thicker. What bothers me is the "" scrolling "" through the pages. With a "swipe gesture" I can not get far with the iPhone and have to keep scrolling. While this is complaining of high-end-level, but who is used to something else will understand me pretty well. With the S7 Edge I came a long way with a gesture and it was really top. If that is somehow adjustable under IOS, let me know. Ansonten the cell phone for people is great for me, because it's a nice change with a nice look. Long-time Apple users, have visually for 3 years, nothing else to face, which hopefully changes with the Iphone 8. Then I definitely remain with Apple. Of course you can hope that no Iphone 7s with the same optics will come!
7823	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Markus E.	3	Switching made easy?	2017-01-13	de	Please note: This is my first real remission! Usually I do not write these, only here it was important to me to understand the differences between the two worlds of Android. In my opinion, only the differences between the Android flagship and the iPhone of the latest generation. About the ecosystem, the technical details or the processing, etc. was discussed in detail in other reviews. I think the drops sucked as the iPhone and e.g. a Samsung Galaxy S7 technically in no way inferior (see at least the point display even the Samsung front.) My sticking point "" Differences to Android "", which annoys me personally really! Sure, for some it is trifles, but for me, the iOS so far only from the "" hear - say "" knew, partly already a disappointment.1. WLAN can not be connected via WPS-Push method! (Press the button on the router, dial WPS on the mobile phone - in it! Without a password, etc.) 2. WhatsApp has 5 registers, which I think is absolutely unnecessary and waste of space. In return, you can not see any profile pictures in "" Contacts "", only name & status.3. Switching the alarm time is very complicated. For Android: Click on the clock, customize, done. Apple: Click on the clock, edit the top left, then select the desired alarm clock, then adjust the clock and confirm. WTF? 4th The keyboard can not be adjusted. I would like to have commas and question marks on the first page without having to keep leafing.5. Gmail can only sync with PUSH through the Gmail app.6. You can not adjust the volume of Alarm, Media, Music and System separately. Distinction only between ringtone and "" media "." That's just my personal opinion! I do not want any tips ala: "" Do not hesitate to download a new Alarm Clock App, Gmail etc. "" - of course you can download an alternative for everything, but the so highly praised "" quality and efficiency "" of apps on iOS was a crucial Purchase criterion for me. I'm disappointed. Yes! Most games may look higher on iOS, but I'm not the gamer on the phone. We do not need to discuss that the iPhone 7 is a sharp device. System, Flow, Display, Battery etc. that fits! However, not everything is as it has always been portrayed in the Apple fan world. That's certainly the other way around, but that's not what this short review is all about. It just portrays my personal opinion and may help those who are not yet deluded that the iPhone is ultimately a good one - but it's just a smartphone with strengths and weaknesses. Thanks for reading, about a positive rating I am happy. Just comment on questions. I like to take supplements!
7824	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Yando_SB	4	Opinion of a mobile phone salesman	2016-10-31	de	First of all: I did not purchase the iPhone via Amazon, but now use the platform to write my opinion on Apple's new flagship and give potential buyers an opportunity to buy. In general, the 7er does not differ much from its predecessor 6s, And yet, some changes have been made.And exactly this I would like to address in my review: -The new HomebuttonIn comparison to the previous models, Apple is the new iPhone on a kind of 3D Touch, which is to simulate a physical button by a vibration feedback (Taptic Engine) , Good thing! The intensity of the vibration can be adjusted in the settings, feels good and does not wear out. However, the new "" button "ALWAYS needs skin contact. Not a touch pen, a living finger. Thus, thanks to iOS 10, the iPhone can no longer be unlocked with, for example, special mobile phone shoes, since unlocking with the help of a code always requires the push of a button. New Taptic Engine makes sense and is simply a step into the future. In a nutshell; The engine is the new vibration in the lower part of the device, which also simulates the push of a button. This is also used, for example, when scrolling through a list in the lower part. You know that, "" Enter your date of birth "" and you choose on 3 reels day, month and year. Between each selection, the device vibrates quite easily, as if you turn on the wheel of fortune;) .- CameraIm direct comparison to the 6s you can see no difference. Really no. Maybe if you play the pictures on a 4k TV or print on poster size you will notice a slight difference, but not as a normal consumer. - Loss of headphone jackWill I do not really go into it, I personally it is sausage. Apple finally adds an adapter, which is something you can not argue about. New colors Since iPhone 5 I am generally very skeptical about black iPhones. Of course, the new colors look great, in my opinion, the most beautiful iPhones so far, but I see them scratched and worn after 3-4 months, whether with or without shell. I remember very well my beautiful iPhone 5, which after 2 months (MIT sleeve) had the first bright spots on the back. Powder coating rubs off on a commodity that slides 100 times daily through the fingers. The diamond black iPhone of my colleague had already after 2 weeks various scratches on the back, and he really treats it like a raw egg.- LautsprecherNa finally! Clean and above all loud sound from first 2 speakers. Class, really useful, even if the speaker above a whole corner quieter than the usual main speakers, the entire sound convinced. DisplayGroß praised the 25% brighter display with even more colors. Well, Heller? No. Nagut, not directly. The maximum brightness is achieved only in the auto-brightness mode in direct sunlight, in order to continue to grant reasonably good readability. Also, the new color space can be noticed only in direct comparison slightly, it just looks a bit better.
7825	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	wennmanmalsonstnichtszutunhat	5	if you do not do anything else	2016-09-25	de	I had the iPhone 6s and had sworn that as soon as the whole thing comes out waterproof I will buy the new device. I did that right away. I was able to update without much loss of value because I was able to sell my old device very well. What many have not mentioned yet are the small feedback that the device provides about the Taptic engine in everyday use: for example, when adjusting the times of the alarm clock or pull down the notification bar, etc. This is of course not decisive for the fight, but that's it What I appreciate about Apple: They really try to make you feel like you do not just have a cheap, stupid electronics thing in your hand. It is also a bit lighter, that feels very comfortable. The camera is better, the battery life is a little better. I am very happy with the purchase.
7826	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	"Andreas Gryphius, Dichter"	2	Software no longer up-to-date and too complicated	2017-09-05	de	Got the iPhone as a service phone. And I do not like it at all. All very awkward.- no back button- I can only use my good headphones when I carry the adapter along.- I also have the new MacBook Pro and Apple was seriously so unable to give any way to charge the iPhone on the Mac, ios: - Terrible zero-customizable keyboard with bad auto-correctionWhen you have multiple messages from one person, they will all be displayed one at a time on the lock screen and block them- Notifications can not be removed easily with a short swipe icon can not be positioned at will on the home screen - the widgets are a joke
7827	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Krato	4	Unauthorized skepticism	2016-09-26	de	I admit that I was more than skeptical after the launch of Apple's new flagship. In particular, the missing headphone jack shocked me a lot because I'm a music enthusiast. Despite everything, I immediately decided to pre-order the iPhone 7 32 GB in matte black and got it now with a lot of luck. Design / For me, the iPhone 7 looks the design almost identical to the iPhone 6S. Only by the new antenna guide on the back and the missing jack connection you can see the new model. However, Apple has fundamentally changed something after heavy criticism in the past - the iPhone 7 is finally protected to IP 67! That means it's finally dust and water resistant! So it does not bother even if the smartphone plops briefly while bathing in the tub. ;) But you should not risk it yet.Display / The resolution remains unchanged at 1334 x 750 pixels in a 4.7-inch display. New to recognize, however, is the color representation. The display generally seems a bit brighter and fresher, somehow more colorful. I think it's a pretty decent upgrade compared to the previous model! It is much more pleasant for the Augen.Kamera / In the smartphone is a 12-megapixel main camera which has an optical image stabilizer, which is very helpful especially when shooting video. I think that the pictures are much better than the iPhone 6s! The photos just seem a tick sharper. But what strikes me most is that the photos look more realistic. They are not as extremely colorful as it was at the 6s. Since it seemed partially unrealistic. The vote is perfect in my opinion. As synonymous with the previous model video recordings are also possible in 4K.But even the selfie (front) camera has been improved to a whopping 7 megapixels. As a selfie lover, I am naturally very excited about it, although an improvement was overdue. With the photos, I am also really satisfied. Battery / As the battery in many people plays a major role, I would like to mention it here briefly. This was demonstrably improved enormously and has held out with me after intensive day use loosely. That was absolutely not the case with my 6s and Galaxy S7! Annoying, however, is the point that you still are not able / was to introduce a quick-charge (quick charge). I find that embarrassing. So you really have to be patient until the battery is charged, and it goes much faster with an iPad charging cable. Features / Apple dispensed with the popular home button for the first time and integrated a touch-sensitive button, which is activated by Force Touch. At first, I was slightly skeptical about how this should work. But I have to say everything works as usual. No delays or reaction problems. Therefore, this rather questionable change is not necessarily negative. Now the most obvious and the most criticized change. The jack socket. The good news in advance for all skeptics - The delivery includes a Lightning adapter and headphones included. In addition, there is still the possibility to operate the old headphones with the iPhone 7. But I have to say honestly, especially as a music enthusiast ... that was definitely a shot in the oven. Although it looks more beautiful without a socket. But the sound quality is noticeably worse. Sometimes I even had problems that my headphones were even recognized. But I think that this is a hardware error that can be handled by an update. Conclusion / The iPhone has made noticeable progress compared to the 6s in all areas. But if you think it's right to switch from 6s to 7 for some minimal updates then everyone has to decide for themselves. I did it and am more than satisfied with it.
7828	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Tonkbert	2	Lousy call quality, great for apps	2017-08-17	de	Unfortunately miserable call quality (synonymous with the other party, only no problem if both sides use a headset ...), great for apps. Looks good.
7829	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Marwin1984	5	Apple has done everything right again with the iPhone 7	2016-10-30	de	What should great say to an iPhone The processing of the iPhone is great and Apple has done this year again right with the iPhone 7 I am more than happy and am glad that I have this sweetheart
7830	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Ti12	4	The best iPhone ever!	2016-10-04	de	As mentioned in my title, I consider the iPhone 7 to be the best iPhone (not smartphone) ever. It's a nice progression over the iPhone 6s. Can the iPhone 7 stand up to the competition? In a nutshell: YES! When opening the packaging, disillusionment spread at first. The first thought: This is an iPhone 6s? Because the iPhone 7 looks exactly like the predecessor from the front, which I find a bit boring considering that this is not an "" S "" version. On the other hand, the reverse side looks "a bit different", provided that one decides on the color variants "black" or "diamond black". The feeling is exactly the same! The few grams that the device has taken, one does not notice. However, what one clearly perceives is the even larger camera "" mountain "". If you have the device lying on the table and typing, it wobbles now even more than its predecessor. I know it can be fixed with a cover. But why the new colors when I hide them behind a shell? Does not work for me.1) Performance: The device runs and runs. There is not much more to say. It has no problems with current games. There are never any jerks or delays. Do you notice the speed increase compared to the iPhone 6s? Under no circumstance! One or the other App starts a few seconds earlier, but felt that makes, in my eyes, no difference! 2) Camera: The camera makes excellent pictures. Especially in dark events, a clear difference compared to the predecessor can be seen. Test pictures will follow! 3) Display: Is a resolution that is a little above HD in 2016? Not in my eyes! It looks sharp, on its own. Compared to the competition you have to say that you can clearly see the difference. The displays of Andoird competition is much sharper! AND you can see that too! What also does not convince me is the color representation of the new display. Bigger color space? For me, the display is slightly yellowish! It looks like the "Night-Shift" feature on the iPhone 6s is turned on. The display also gets a "slight" yellowish tinge. Otherwise, the viewing angles are great and about 3D touch can be argued. Who uses this feature anyway? I am even more bothered when you see, for example, Move apps into folders and then you trigger 3D touch.4) The new home button: First, a strange "" different "" feeling to press this. But you get used to it relatively quickly. However, I would still prefer to use the "" normal "" home button.5) Protected from water and dust: I never needed. I will hopefully never need it. BUT nice to have! Can the competition already longer! 6) Speakers: The new speakers are really great! Finally, speakers that are equal to a HTC. Especially since the speaker of the iPhone 6 (s) already belonged to the best of its kind. Do the speakers replace an external speaker? Under no circumstance! Exclusively to use, if you have no external speakers available. 7) 3.5 mm jack is missing! For me neither disadvantage nor advantage! Adapter is included and otherwise are Earpods with appropriate cable! Conclusion: The best iPhone? YES! The best smartphone? Yeah, in terms of performance Yeah in terms of display Yeah in terms of hype: NO
7831	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	TheoStar	4	iPone 7 vs. iPhone 6 - not a must, no groundbreaking innovations, rather a "outdated" 6s	2016-09-23	de	I have used the iPhone 6s so far and have now received the new iPhone 7. I am a former Android user and have always got on well with my HTC Oni Mini 2. Ie. I am not an iPhone disciple and I prefer basically. Here I describe my subjective impressions iPhone 6s, 64 GBNew model: iPhone 7, 32 GB ** Mobile ** The devices are basically identical. You can only see through tiny details what the 6s and what the 7 is. I decided against the diamond black, because it looks scratch-prone. At first it looks very noble, probably not very long in my mobile phone use. I have now the matte black and am very satisfied with it. Overall, the iPhone 7 makes a valuable and stable impression. ** Speed ​​** Here I recognize as a "normal gas consumer" hardly a difference between the two models. The processor in the new iPhone 7 is supposed to be much faster than the 6s, but I notice no difference in everyday use. Hanging and stuttering, I do not know the iPhone 6s. Possibly. CPU speed can become an issue in complex (3D) games. If you do not use the mobile phone for this, you can do without the 7 in my opinion. ** Camera ** The camera is the main reason for me to swap the 6s for the 7, because I film a lot with it. The optical image stabilizer brings a good improvement on videos compared to the 6s. The stabilizer was installed in the 6s only in the plus version, d. H. my 6s did not have this yet. Here I see a clear improvement and that is a great win for me the 7ers. The photos of the main camera are only a few shots better than in the 6s model. Especially in low light conditions can be seen here an improvement. Otherwise not. For amateur / amateur photographers like me, that's barely noticeable. Although the flash, color space and the aperture are improved, but I think that brings little if you have no professional claims. The front camera has been improved from 5 to 7 megapixels. Here are better selfies possible. ** Where is the Homebutton? ** Here's Apple's a new way - the home button, as you always know him, is gone. This is simulated on the touch surface (including vibration), as you know it from other phones. For me an advantage: a mechanical part less, which can break. I have often heard of older models that at some point the Homebutton had to be changed. The only point of criticism: in winter you have to take off the gloves to use the homebutton. I'm getting along well with the new development.** Headphone jack?!? ** Apple goes here also a new (innovative?) Way and renounces the old (dear won) jack. There are a few Lightning headphones and a Lightning-to-jack adapter included, d. H. you can connect to the connection headphones, which actually charges the phone. Sound technically I recognize as a hobby listener no difference. Alternatively, you can use Bluetooth headphones. Important: Use Lightning headphones and at the same time charge the phone does not work, because you only have one port on the phone. ** Battery life ** The model 7 is designed to run up to two hours longer. I do not notice a huge difference, but the iPhone has to go to the charger every night anyway. Here you should not expect too much. ** Waterproof Case ** Apple advertises the iPhone 7 as dust and waterproof for 30 minutes and to a depth of one meter. At the same time, there is no guarantee of water damage, as before. Ie. Apple does not pay when the water sensor strikes the inside of the device. Although I believe Apple, that the 7 Series is waterproof (he). However, I will not do a deliberate test for warranty reasons. Should the phone ever fall into the water - unfortunately it happens to me from time to time that it falls - then I will post here if it survived. ** stereo speaker ** The new stereo speakers are louder and a little clearer than the speaker in the iPhone 6s. In particular, the increased volume, I think nice. But here, too, no miracle of technology is to be expected. The iPhone does not (yet) replace a good sound system. It is and remains a mobile phone. ** CONCLUSION ** The change from iPhone 6s to iPhone 7 makes only limited sense. Who is satisfied with the 6s and not urgently the faster processor, the slightly better camera or the (almost) waterproof case needs, should wait another year on the iPhone 8. The announcements promise something totally new, while the 7 is more or less an outdated 6s. Update 14.10.2016 I have now photographed and filmed at several concerts and compared with the pictures of the discarded cell phone 6s. Here you can see slight advantages in low light conditions even on unprofessional photos. The videos are getting a whole lot better. Even if that is probably negligible for hobby relationships. I'm happy about it. I did not have to check the waterproofness so far. Luckily. The phone is stable and easy.
7832	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Daniel	5	Change 4s to 7	2016-10-17	de	I have grown from 4S to 7 after 5 years and am very excited. Even in the sea, I have already swum and have made wonderful holiday videos / photos. Only and alone that you can not load and listen to music at the same time I noticed the opener unpleasant. Otherwise thumbs up!
7833	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Dennis	4	The iPhone in the 7th generation	2016-10-19	de	I have been an Apple customer for years and always happy about new devices which are brought to the market. So I was looking forward to the iPhone 7 which should replace my iPhone 6 from the service. I hesitated and asked myself if I really need it because at first glance the 7 Series did not seem to be much more advanced than the 6 or 6S. Well, I thought, I'll do it in three steps: buy, test, judge. After much deliberation and a long wait, I may now hold for a few days, my iPhone 7 in the hands ... First impression when ordering, and a point of criticism: crap! Where is my space gray? My beautiful Space Gray is gone! Yes, since Apple has actually designed a new color palette and left the space gray away. That annoyed me a bit, but okay, the color should not fail, then I just take black, that fits reasonably. The diamond black was a bit too dark for me then and I can not do anything with gold or rose gold. But what made me happy is that there is a 32GB version. For this I have decided The first impression of the iPhone: The commissioning worked flawlessly. Externally, I hardly noticed a change. Weight similar to a few grams, dimensions are also similar in feel, optics very similar. Only in the colors Apple has brought about a change as already mentioned. Second point of criticism and what has disturbed me personally is that Apple has not made it again to integrate the camera into the case. No, it had to be again a camera protruding from the housing. The 6er looked OK but now I can not really need it anymore iPhone accessories Handy, EarPods with Lightning Connector, Lightning to USB cable, 5W USB Power Adapter, Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack AdapterTechnik and Fortschritt: From the Technology I do not really want to look big and detail, the exact specifications can be read at Apple. I'll go into the review on a few components and write as I assess them. Technically, the iPhone 7 is on the state of the art. A few things have been improved a little bit. But the sensation of a new mega mobile phone has failed. That the 7 Series should be splash-proof and dust-proof is nothing special for me. Other manufacturers have developed these functions years ago, and that Apple wants to hang this feature now for your own benefit on the big bell I do not like What was not written in the media and everything speculated, what was not there for a hype around the 7 Series.Basically, it's just an iPhone which has been improved a little bit. The switch from 6 or 6S to 7 is not really worth it. A technical sensation would be e.g. If you could have charged the iPhone by solar, in my opinion, that would have been more of a sensation. Or a camera that does not protrude from the case, that would have been a step forward, at least optical screen: The screen knows clear and clear, brilliant colors. The graphics are always smooth and smooth. The display responds immediately during operation. The iPhone still does not know long, annoying load times. The processor works fast and reliable. The color representation presents itself in natural tones and is naturally great in connection with the sharpness of the high-resolution display in addition the display should be a little brighter. According to Apple, the brightness of the 6er was 500cd, the 7er he should now be slightly above 600cd. In everyday life, this is particularly beneficial in sunlight. But ... Battery: ... you should use the function of the brighter display so you have to adjust to a higher power consumption. The battery is not much further developed, I see no difference, and I said that when switching from 5 to 6. Should be called the battery was hardly developed, absolute criticism and weakness of Apple. Especially with 3G / 4G use, there is a large battery consumption of memory 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. The 256GB are first offered by Apple on an iPhone and of course offer a hammer storage space. But the fun of course has its price: The iPhone 7 in the Apple Store with 256GB costs 979 ¬, the iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB even 1119 ¬. Everyone, of course, has to know for themselves how much capacity they need. As for the storage capacity, I think that Apple offers a 32GB version. I did not like the jump from 16GB to 64GB at the 6th Camera: The whole details of the camera I will not all runterleiern here, there's also read at Apple.What is there to say is that the iPhone still makes wonderful photos. Razor sharp and high resolution, just great. I'm always amazed what fascinating photos a mobile phone can shoot. Videos are also a feast for the eyes, you can also easily watch on the PC or TV, the resolution is high enough to act like HD. However, it is very annoying for me personally that the camera now really looks even uglier than the 6 Series ... such a big stand-out thing, just terrible. Can not make friends with me at least Housing: Slim as ever. According to Apple dust and splashproof. Can I say nothing, did not take the 7 in the woods or with the shower. But as mentioned earlier, this feature has already brought other manufacturers to market. Compared to the 6S, the case of the 7 Series (Not 7 Plus) is 5 grams lighter. Otherwise, everything has remained the same as its predecessor. The dimensions are identical, only the weight is different. Can you easily read here: [...] Weight iPhone 7 143 gMan will therefore hardly be able to perceive a differenceNoch my opinion on the IOS 10 which appeared a few weeks ago: Me find it completely nonsensical and unnecessary. My biggest criticism: The "strike to the right" on the display of the iPhone when unlocking has been removed. I have to say that I'm now at least 6 years Apple users and for at least 6 years, the devices by swipe to the right unlock. And suddenly the function is gone. If you now delete (and that happens purely out of habit just automatically until you have laboriously umgewöhnt especially if you have done it for years) come (useless) messages and any messages or a message center. That's annoying and I'm just wondering what Apple thought. To unlock the iPhone, you have to press the home button twice (once to turn on the display and once more to enter the code) The user interface has become much unfriendlier due to the update, another criticism: the control center. Previously you could just pull the control center from the bottom up and then it was a solid "part" on the display. Now you can switch back and forth between two pages and that disturbs scary when you are e.g. wants to adjust the brightness. You turn off the brightness and the page goes away, and you have to get used to the fact that the old control center is gone ... just annoying and annoying for people who are used to something else Conclusion at the end: iPhone 7 - A great piece of technology. A high quality smartphone with good workmanship, technology & features. It offers a lot of technology, added value, comfort and fun. But a real innovation, a great progress or development is not. There is no technical sensation. Of course, everyone has to decide for themselves if he chooses. It really is worth it, if you have an iPhone from the 6 Series, not. If you have an old or never had an iPhone or you are looking for a great smartphone you are super served with the 7 Series. But for me was the 7th nothing new here ... for me simply away an iPhone that carries the name "7" instead of "6". Because I could not see much progress for myself and I would have been satisfied with my 6er still I would be 3 stars especially because of the hated ios 10 update. For newcomers or old model owners, the phone itself would be worth 5 stars. So on average, I'll just give you 4 stars on average!

7834	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Test123	3	After so many years Android now Apple ...	2016-10-21	de	Out of curiosity, I switched to the iPhone 7 128GB Matt Black a good two weeks ago. After the endless rave reviews on the part of the Apple users, how unbelievably great the system would be, I have to say that I was disillusioned rather quickly. Many features that have long been standard on Android, Apple has not yet discovered for themselves (file manager, send files via Bluetooth, set your own ringtones, phone book contacts mark etc. pp ...) Also the performance in comparison to my 269 € OnePlus X or the previous Nexus 4 is not a revelation. Yes, it runs fast, but not faster. And yes, there were occasionally stuttering on Android, which, however, is just as much and more pronounced in the case of the iPhone 7. I also had Already 2 complete crashes. Then nothing went for about 10 minutes until the device rebooted by itself. I have only installed a few standard apps (Whatsapp, Facebook, Runtastic u nd a few others) so no "" special stuff "" that would be known for problems. Android is clearly the system that offers much more extensive operation options. It goes in many places just deeper into the matter and is no less fluent. Apple users who claim that iOS 1000x would be better, unfortunately I can not take from now on for full. The probably had so far nothing else than Apple in hand. Unfortunately a very expensive realization. Nevertheless, the iPhone is a good Smartphone.- It has a great display! Color reproduction and illumination are excellent, although the resolution could be a bit higher. You can see the difference to a Full HD display but quite clear, if you had something before.- The sound of speakers and (reasonable) headphones is the best that I could hear so far on a smartphone! - The camera is a total top! Images are always sharp and do not blur. The videos are free of vibration and very smooth. The sound is very good over. The colors could be crisper. They sometimes look a bit pale. This has nothing to do with reality. The memory is generous with 128 GB and one has not the trouble with the dizzy storage management on Android (app on SD, app intern, app on both, SD configured as internal storage...) - The quality of the phone I find less good. I often have a lot of background noise and when talking on the Bluetooth handsfree in the car, while driving, the connection is extremely bad. No matter where I am. This was better before! - The battery will last for about 2 days under normal conditions. I think that's great! - The loading takes a long time. From 0-100 short 3 hours.- Sometimes annoys the already mentioned jerking and "hang on" "already extreme. Especially because you would not have expected that from an Apple device at the price. To 99% it runs fast and completely liquid.- The Homebutton with Taptic Engine is for my feeling GENIAL! I got used to it right away and would not want to miss that anymore. The fingerprint recognition works lightning fast.- The missing jack connection does not bother me. That it had to be a "Lightning" and no USB port, is annoying. Of course, I knew that before ... a few cables worried and good.- The synchronization of images, music and files between PC and iPhone is awkward! That could have done much better and must (see Android!). You can not send a few pictures to the notebook via Bluetooth! Such a nonsense! - Biggest plus in comparison to Android is of course the supply of updates. Apple does it the way I would for all other manufacturers. Since 5 years old devices are still supported. All in all, the iPhone makes what I want, if sometimes over the detour. I will certainly use it for the next 3 years, but then switch back to the Android world. That's just me as technikaffinen user mehr.Schlecht the iPhone and iOS is certainly not. Just different.

7836	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Caro	1	HANDS OFF	2017-04-06	de	When today the package arrived with me, I was happy as a small child. However, this joy did not last long. Because in my package, although the whole accessory was ONLY NO IPHONE !!!!!! AMAZON, YOU WANT TO TRANSFER TO ME ONLY I AM ON 180.
7837	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Benedictu	2	iPhone is pure consumerism, because again there is no good reason to use the latest model for more than a year	2017-02-26	de	Does one have to have the device, if one does not get it just officially made available? The new waterproofness, the increased computing power, the better camera, the larger memory are conceivable reasons for purchase. Who decides on the device, the film Belkin ScreenForce InvisiGlass screen protector (suitable for iPhone 7), which is perfectly centered in the Apple store, and the case Apple MMW82ZM / A iPhone 7 Silicone Case black for protection and preservation of value recommended (see photo), so he gets rid of it in good time before the iPhone 8 at a good price. In the telephony Apple has lost the connection to the top. The so-called SAR value, which indicates the specific absorption rate of mobile phone radiation in watts per kilogram of body tissue, positions the iPhone 7 virtually as the tail light of the competitor field. The SAR reading of the iPhone 7 is still a factor of 1.4 from the limit of 2 W / kg with 1.38 W / kg, but in fact six times as high as some competing models, almost a factor of 10 stay below the limit. Those who often need to make calls in places with poor mast coverage or good shielding will be inclined to wait for an improved iPhone 8 or higher. FAZIT Apple is a rational actor taking advantage of its opportunities. To blame them is therefore as pointless as criticizing a US president or a car brand because it produces polluting SUVs. Because it is always the little man who has set the course by his choice. So as long as consumers are so uncritical about their favorite brands and with rather inconsequential innovations, which are commonly referred to as product care, cheer with 4- and 5-star reviews as in the sports palace, instead of just waiting for the next or next version it will continue for a long time. Also to the detriment of the environment, which is mainly burdened by the production of unnecessary electronics. A high-quality, elaborately produced electronic device, which one can not operate satisfied and with good conscience for some years, but because of its shortcomings better one sees the first best opportunity to get each newer, is a sacrilege. My favorite brand Apple has less to be ashamed of than its uncritical customers.
7838	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Chr	1	Apple is the last junk	2018-04-17	de	If you could express the word police state with a cell phone, it would be the iPhone 7. As usual Apple not many customization options. A fingerprint sensor, and to the blast and probably the biggest selling point on the phone: A home button where you can set the minimum fineness, woow! What a senseless hipster shit. I would knock this drecks cell phone in the bin, if it were not my company phone ... The missing AUX connection is a joke. You need the annoying iTunes on the PC to download music to the phone. The power is supplied by something you once again only found in Apple, which is why it is not so easy to borrow from a colleague the charging cable. The phone does not seem very sturdy.
7839	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	dot_ore	3	Do not skin me! 6S v 7	2016-09-18	de	I got the iPhone 7 for the release day and had a couple of days to test it thoroughly. The technical details should now be clear to all. Likewise, the optics, which is almost identical to the 6 Series. Excluding the missing headphone jack -> stereo speakers, the slightly better integrated antenna, two new colors and the revised Hombutton with Taptic Engine. The display was also expanded in the color spectrum but not really noticeable. The contrast is slightly better and the colors are clearer. Unfortunately, the phone takes much longer at startup than my 6S. Both have the current iOS 10 on it! My test is primarily about the camera in the iPhone 7. After many photos shot, I must say that the slightly larger aperture F 1.8, although more light and thanks to the optical image stabilizer, the pictures a bit sharper, yet the differences are tiny. Some shots during the day seem a little bit overexposed. But scores the camera in poor lighting conditions. Here is an improvement to see. However, the shots are sometimes alienated, that is too lightened and thus do not quite correspond to the reality. Likewise, the slightly drilled selfie camera, now in HD with 7 MP, which also has an image stabilizer. The photos are usually less blurred than the 6S, but the quality of the photos is hardly a difference. Since I am privately involved in photography, I had considered moving as a mobile camera on the 7 Series. But after the few days I'm not convinced. The normal 7 Series is not a worthy successor to the 6S for me. At most a 6S + or so. Anyone else who still owns a 6S, let's just wait until the iPhone 8!
7840	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	4	Once iPhone always iPhone ..	2016-11-02	de	I could not decide at first between the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7. After two weeks of use of the Galaxy S7, I have to say that Android is too unstable and the apps are not 100% optimized for the device. Mir is known that Android now times hiss manufacturer must provide, but then bothers me but something the advertising in the apps and that in Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger does not see what the opposite of me writes or what I write at the moment, as the keyboard Although there are quite a few other keyboards that can be installed on an Android device (this is what makes the operating system, among other things), I do not need such bells and whistles. I'm in the case just a dull user. So much for the Galaxy S7 in combination with Android. My first smartphone was an iPhone 3GS. Since then, I had only iPhone's in the house and was always happy with it. Clearly you have to live with restrictions such as that one is dependent on iTunes or the setting options in the cp. to Android are not so diverse, but I personally do not need it all. I had initially opted for the Galaxy S7, since the price in the. to the iPhone 7 was much more enticing and I just wanted to try something new. After all, it was enough for two whole weeks. ;-) In addition, I found it a bit disappointing Apple, that the iPhone 7 brings no real innovation. In the end, it is an iPhone 6 2.0.Dennoch I am so impressed with the iOS, that was worth the purchase for me. Before that, I had an iPhone 5. With iOS everything runs smoothly and the apps are perfectly optimized. And that justifies in my opinion the higher price.
7841	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	wc3nt3	4	The best smartphone on the market	2016-10-01	de	After 2 years, it is now time, my iPhone 6 will be inherited and replaced with an iPhone 7. I've been in my possession for 1.5 weeks now and I have to say that the jump is huge! This is certainly synonymous because I skipped a generation haben.Nun but to the actual product in the form of a +/- list + speed is insanity + camera skin me really stool + battery ==> very clear big step forward (still 50% am End of the day) + Memory Top (has never been an issue for me, since minimum 64GB) + jack socket replacement by Lightning = much better sound + stereo speakers sound really good + Diamond Black very noble + iOS 10 is solid and has many new features to offer - none Apple Pay Support for GermanySummary: I have deliberately kept short and here my impressions provided. My iPhone 6 with up-to-date iOS10 software still bans any android today. On the hardware side, it had to be improved after 2 years and Apple managed to do so in an impressive manner with the iPhone 7. Update 11.05.2017 still very satisfied, BUT ==> Jet Black attracts fingerprints and scratches "" MAGIC "", so a star deduction !

7843	iPhone 7	128GB	Argent 	Andynator	5	just an Apple	2017-03-15	de	Unfortunately, there are too many jealous people on the market who prefer to use Android phones. But let it be one for years and the market figures say it's a bad product just because you can not or do not want to afford it The phone is as always class-wise, of quality anyway and above all, stable in use. I have iPhones since Generation 4 and have never had a crash. We have in the household exclusively Apple products that work well with each other. There are 3 iPhones, 2 Mackbooks, a Mac Mini, 3 IPdas and an airport. There has never been any problem with any device, just once an application error promptly resolved by friendly service personnel. Also there is certainly how to call into the forest .... All in all, a phone without quirks. We will stay here in the future and can only recommend it.
7844	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	H. Michael	2	Ingenious mobile phone minus sound quality minus radiation minus price	2017-01-11	de	Well, I'm doing it very briefly. I'm in principle very convinced by Apple and I'm not deterred by the lack of headphone jack. It would in principle be a great smartphone + chic design + battery is ok (could be bigger but is enough) + great performance + iCloud and iTunes Convenience + feel engine and 3D touch complete the whole very good as far as 5 stars from me Now come the problems that raises the iPhone with which I honestly did not expect.- 1 star due to the price. I knew that and I expected that, but the purchase still hurts. Unfortunately, my old iPhone was broken unexpectedly, so I needed a new one and thought then I want a "" current "" device. If you then informed and the high-end smartphones of the competition looks like with similar (some better) features for half of the price offered you have to swallow-1 star because of the problematic sound quality ... The adapter ensures losses in the Sound quality and Bluetooth is unfortunately not implemented as you would expect, especially from Apple. Bluetooth is fine with the Bose system. Before that it did not matter because Aux was always available. Now you need a good wireless connection. Unfortunately, e.g. not a decent Bluetooth Aux find adapter, since Apple does not support the apTX standard (Bluetooth in CD quality!) - 1 star deduction because of the high radiation value, I have read randomly online. The radiation value is in the cell phone is well above the values ​​of the competition, Partial Factor 4! Apple himself says you should not hold the device to the head ... More you have to say at this point I think I do not think I'll sell it and get me a 6S or something. Maybe I also dare to jump to Android. Mainly because of the audio quality :(
7845	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Ferdinand Schenker	3	Jack plugs are important	2017-03-16	de	Yes, Apple, I have seen the video that it is a "shocker" to abolish such an old technology. In practice, the unilateral nerves annoying - as if the charging port is not annoying enough, I need an adapter now and can not then parallel load and listen. When purchasing I would not have guessed how much this "" feature "" will bother me. Everything else described as in previous versions.
7846	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Matthias	2	I love Apple - but THAT is not here at all :-( iPhone 7 the pure disappointment, I stay with the iPhone SE ...	2016-09-21	de	Well, what can I say, I'm really disappointed. As much as I love Apple and like to pay the money. I have a lot of devices from Apple in use and had in the past pretty much every iPhone. Most of the time I ordered it right after the keynote, because I never really could wait and it was well worth it. But since the release of the iPhone 6S, Apple has left something to be desired as far as the iPhone is concerned. I try that - just in terms of the iPhone 7 to justify something. Maybe some people think about that instead of throwing their money out the window ... 1. Less and less novelties - but always more expensive Somehow, nothing more really happens at Apple. as far as the iPhone is concerned. Not just visually, but generally. Apple presents things and argues with things that other manufacturers have long since, where this is already standard. For example the thing with IP67 and things like that. Somehow nothing is doing more - and I think that's a pity. Because there was a time, there it was still very different ... Especially in times of Steve Jobs, RIP. I do not know, I would just wish that I get more for my money than the whole 0815 crap. Do not misunderstand, technically the iPhone is, especially now with the 7, of course, top and there is nothing to complain about it. But does all that really justify such an enormous price of over 1000 euros? No.2. Always bigger, but why the hell no 4-inch version anymore? What I do not like is the growing size! I'm one of many who do not want to carry a brick with them. I prefer the 4 "variant, which was the reason to switch from the iPhone 6S to the iPhone SE again - which makes me very grateful that Apple has released this" special edition ". So, why the hell again only a 4.7 and 5.5 inches version? Why bring an alternative to the big models back on the market, if you destroy them directly at the release of the new generation? What kind of sense does it make? There are many like me who would prefer the 4 "version - you could clearly see on the iPhone SE. For me that's why the 7 Series is not for me in question, much I prefer keeping my iPhone SE.3. Different features to the "" brick "" (Plus model) What should actually this crap with the different features in the models? Why has only the plus the 2nd Camera Lens from the telephoto lens? That's just the whole people fooled. As if this feature could not be included in the 4.7 "version. You do not understand, for all love.The Plus model is really nothing, the part is too big. Even had the iPhone 6S Plus - put it in your pocket in summer when you're wearing shorts. No, just no. Alone half the tablet to hold the phone to the ear, 188g heavy ... No, again no. Nothing for me ... (matter of taste, no question ...) 4. Same design, old technology, where is the innovation?! I always smile when I look at the Apple Keynote on the iPhone. People are blinded by such massive improvements, especially compared to older models. More speed, better CPU / GPU blah blah ... What itches me! Anyone who already knows an iPhone knows exactly that they always run fluffy and never hang! I have never noticed a really noticeable difference. Benchmark back and forth - it does not itch me anything, because you hardly notice it anyway, if you use it just as normal. Camera is the only thing that happens every now and then, if only minimally. But instead of finally integrating this ugly camera lens into the (!) Case, no, they remove the 3.5mm jack connector and only offer Lightning. It does not seem to matter that you can not charge iPhone 7 AND listen to music at the same time. Since you have to (no, you should) just for a sleazy 170.- Euro buy the new wireless headphones ... Yes no, is clear! Back to the camera lens, which still stands out the back, which in my opinion would be really better to solve (other manufacturers manage it): The only reason why the iPhone has not been thinner and slimmer so far, were 2 reasons: The 3, 5mm jack connection as well as the theme of robustness. NOW, I'm curious to see if there's something new next year and Apple finally gets the turn again - or if the scrape really goes on like the last years. I mean hey, that the jack-connection fell off I really do not care, but I want the iPhone compact, thinner, smaller and without a protruding camera lens, so you can put it on the table, without having to use a shell MUESS.The annoying! -Fact is, I will pay no Euro for the iPhone 7, if, then only at contract renewal, I should then get it for free. Because I'm not ready to pay so much money for such a crap. Please do not get me wrong, it may be technically top, no question. But I'm just concerned that people are blinded with tiny things and everyone thinks they have to have that, just because it's the newest iPhone. That in the 7er, however, to 50% the same hardware as in the 6S, nobody seems to bother. That's just not worth the money! One can argue about the size of the memory, I've always found this an impudence from Apple, but it has always been like that. At least they have now finally adopted the 16GB variant, which was really no longer timely. Because after iOS 9 or 10 were already 4-6 GB occupied, so you would like to have just under 10 GB for your own use. But that's a different story, where everyone has to decide for themselves, which one of the storage is ultimately worth or how much you need. I keep my iPhone SE for now, see no reason to pay the significant extra price, only to my neighbors, friends and acquaintances to show that I have the latest iPhone 7, so they all envy me so much. Find it a pity, especially since I take a lot of pictures and movies, I would have liked the new features of the camera - but not under these "circumstances". Who has the money, please. Loss of value at Apple is thank God very low, so that at any time an Apple iPhone can always sell well. The fact that some are currently offered back on eBay for over 1700, - Euro, just because you have to wait on Apple shows once again just the profit greed of the people ... Apple iPhone 7, how should I love you, you have really disappointed me , driven me away from you, you are indeed really chic, otherwise not wrong, but what you offer me now, it is not worthy to me. In my opinion, save the money and keep the iPhone 6S / SE, is just as good. But this is just my personal objective opinion, based on experience and facts.

Please test the display, watch YouTube videos on this device and compares the resolution and then decide even before you pay so much money.
7848	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Karl	1	The missing headphone jack is a K.O criterion	2017-08-09	de	I have been a big fan of Apple's iPhones since iPhone 4. My last iPhone was an iPhone 6, which I gave away about a month ago, because I received the new iPhone 7 in 256 GB with a new mobile phone contract. For all iPhone 6 converters: the switch is not really worthwhile. The camera is marginally better, the processor is probably faster, but in practice you notice nothing of it. The only other change: the missing headphone jack. This is not an improvement, but a total failure! I think about it every day about the iPhone 7 exchange. The battery lasts a day very difficult. Most of the time I have to recharge during the day. However, this leads to the fact that I always have to take a break when using, so that I can recharge. I talk a lot, listen to music or watch videos from time to time. Then I have to stop in the middle of everything and start charging the phone, because the iPhone does not last the day (with normal use). Really great is the case of calls, where I must either put on speaker or the phone must always hold my ear, because I can not use a headset when charging .. Of course, you could buy an adapter, but is that really useful ?. The provider makes the phones expensive and leaves a connection away. To make up for this, you have to buy an adapter for a lot of money and carry it along permanently, as long as the Driite provider adapter works reliably, because Apple is very rigorous. It hardly has to upgrade iPhone 6 / 6s, but it has a huge disadvantage in everyday life so noticeable that you get the push, you would buy a cell phone for 30 ¬, in fact it is just under 1000 €. Apparently, Apple does not think about that ... I am definitely disappointed for the first time in a long time.
7849	iPhone 7	32GB	Argent 	Jens Reitter	5	Have an S7 edge and will exchange it again for the current iPhone7	2016-09-17	de	Actually I was happy with the iPhone 6, but the hardware of the S7 edge appealed to me a lot. Great part and certainly also cheap, if you compare it with the iPhone. But the Android system, the iOS just can not keep up with the water. Especially with the iOS10 this is striking. Away with the complexity, the barely existing stability ... to the intuitiuven, stable, high-performance and great OS. To iPhone7 now a few words, because I could hold it in my hands: Yes, the design has hardly changed. Why should it be different? It's ok if it succeeds. Since you can treat yourself to an extra year and come up with a new design. It lies well in the mobile phone, does not have the optical Schnick-Schnack the edge of the S7 edge. This edge is rather annoying than helpful, because again and again apps are started that you do not want to start. Just write comments, if you had the thing in his hand. When it comes to a star ... that's ok, but then honestly and with arguments. :)
7850	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	H. Nadine	1	I can not recommend ... on the contrary!	2017-10-03	de	The iPhone is a nuisance: you can not charge at the same time and watch music or videos with headphones, because everything runs on the same access. If you want to shoot a longer video with external micro and has to recharge the battery or wants to use a power bank - bad luck! The transfer of mobile phone to PC does not work, you always have to use the iCloud, with many data you have to buy additional storage - a monthly amount I can not erase the backup of my old iPhone from the new iPhone, so it just shut off while filming. In addition, it is quickly hot when filming ... All in all, so just annoying, because you rely on the various software from Apple and this unfortunately only partially work. I really regret it very much to have bought. One plus: it looks very nice.

7852	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Alex1282	1	the service...	2016-10-10	de	The iPhone 7 has actually earned 4 to 5 stars, this has been written a lot. However, for me is also a good service for a € 870 mobile phone and Apple can no longer deliver. I had problems with my iPhone and went directly to the Apple service. The error could not be solved even after 3 complaints. The service seemed incompetent and dried up. Again and again, the same phrases of the employees used, without a solution to bring about. Consumer rights regarding the warranty for defects under German law were eroded and ignored. The Apple warranty is a priority, even if I would be better off under the warranty. This is very alarming, as a group over the law and law sets. As I was then more and more acidic by the ignorance of the concrete personnel, one has noticed correctly how the employees have the invisible arrogant "" Apple coat "" dressed and no longer argued goal-oriented. Granted, I was a little upset, too, but rightly so. I never became dropping, offensive or personal. With which arrogance but it has to do with a non-functioning 870 ¬ phone at Apple, is absurd and no longer of this world. By the way, was exactly this service at Apple a few years ago, still exemplary. Today, this is often sluggish and bureaucratized. If Apple does not change here soon with the amount of staff and especially well-trained (professional, non-religious;)) professionals, the case will probably deep in the medium to long term, because then lacks the backing in the fan base, the Apple still has today. One should hire more IT people in the service and no theologians;)

As always with Apple (my 3 iPhone) is processed high quality and everything works without problems. All those awarded only one star are poor guys who can afford only a cheap plastic smartphone from the grenade manufacturer Samsung. All Android Smartphone manufacturers have the worst service imaginable. Apple service is top. Had a Samsung S3 before. Was a disaster the phone. Self-ripping displays are not even available at Apple. The Android operating system can not be enough for iOS anyway. Can not understand why some TV manufacturers take such a shitty system as Android even for your TV. Like, for example, the scrap manufacturer Philips. I would always buy an iPhone because it is the best phone.

Unfortunately, I have to say that the disadvantages predominiegen.Mir is incomprehensible how to use the camera of the iPhone 7 even as a start as well or with those The competitions in the dark or at night have an extreme noise, which can not be mitigated by the very limited setting options. In addition, the extreme restrictions and restraints which one submits to the use of an Apple product, for someone who previously an Android device was used, a nuisance. Contacts from the phone book can only be sent to other users of Apple products. When talking on the phone heats up extremely over the entire side of the holding the smartphone, the use of the headset is highly recommended and saves Kopfschmerzen.Ich received the device as a business phone which is why I do not care about the extremely overpriced inappropriate price. No doubt there are also two positive points. The finish and feel is definitely unique in the market and great.2. Apple gives the user a sense of security for their own data and while using Apps.Ich would get me no more iPhone, because you have more disadvantages than advantages in comparison to the competition.

7860	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Keek	1	Too high SAR values ​​- hazardous to health. Keep your fingers away !!	2016-10-01	de	The Apple iphone 7 has a SAR value of 1.238 (W / kg) - absolutely healthy - especially for children, adolescents, heart patients or stressed managers. A nightmare. You should really only make phone calls via headphones. Predecessor models were already extremely borderline with SAR values ​​of 0.93 to 0.97 (w / kg). Laymen should inform themselves at the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (bfs.de) or consumer protection. Further technical innovations: In short "" Nothing new in the West "". Lots of money, lots of chi-chi, which you do not need. Each buyer should know that Apple pays almost no taxes on this product in Europe, while the production costs for this phone are around 20-40 €. In short asocial.
7861	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	nexus-hh	1	They are crazy, the Californians ...	2016-09-25	de	The iPhone 7 has now been delivered directly from Apple, but goes back again. It's brave to bring such a smartphone on the market and then not even available, statement in the Apple Store Hamburg Jugfernstieg, "" Since you have just daily from 6 clock watch online, if you can reserve one, we know not, when or which ones come "". And after this statement, the disinterested hip staff was already gone again. The iPhone 7 sounds audible, not only when you hold your ear directly, but also from a few centimeters away. The display has a slight yellow cast for me, does not look brighter than the 6s. The smartphone will be warm, even when it is not busy, in a software update even hot. The missing headphone jack is annoying, as previously assumed, the sound with adapter slightly worse. The included headphones have always been out of the question, who gets those things properly in the ears, the sound and the quality are miserable anyway. The display edges are still incomprehensible too large, Apple is giving away a larger display area. Battery life is bad as usual. In addition, the phone rattles like crazy when you tap lightly on the back or it touches in the upper part, loose parts? In 2016, I find only HD resolution and no fast charging cable too brave. It is outrageous Apple to offer a smartphone that is not available for sale and that has so many (quality) problems. Quite apart from the completely overpriced price, I therefore advise: Stay away. In addition, the fingerprint sensor also works miserably.

7867	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	Norman	4	iPhone 7 in good quality	2018-12-09	de	The iPhone 7 was delivered very fast. The condition of the used device is good. Display and back as new, only at the edges are small scratching available to the good optical u. but do not question the overall technical condition. There is a point deduction, because no charger and cable were there. I can still recommend the provider.
7868	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Tobi	4	A top smartphone with a huge display!	2018-08-05	de	In advance: ---------- I bought the iPhone 7 Plus not via Amazon, but the release directly from Apple. Therefore, I can not say anything about the delivery. This review is about the iPhone 7 - black - 128gb. Scope of Delivery: -------------------- The iPhone comes in the, typical for Apple, cardboard packaging with chic design the box contains: - iPhone 7 Plus USB to Lightning cable USB charging adapter (power adapter) - Apple Earpods headphones with Lightning connector Lightning to 3.5mm jack adapter- Manual processing: ------------ ------ The iPhone is, as usual Apple, very high quality processed. I could find no material defects or the like. The look in general is very high quality and you can see that you have paid a corresponding price for this. Of course, the Apple prices are always set extremely high, but that's another topic. The 5.5-inch display offers plenty of room for videos and Spiele.Eine reasonable operation is of course no longer possible right here. Also the Earpods, as well as the charging cable are very well made and offer no opportunity to moan.Für the processing therefore schonmal 5 Sterne.Einrichtung / Performance / User experience: ----- -------------------------------------------------- --- Every iPhone owner knows the uncomplicated device of the device. Step by step you are guided through the device and can thus perform this quickly and without problems. The smartphone and its user interface run very quickly and without stuttering. All animations and processes run smoothly and I could not detect any weaknesses on the part of the CPU here. For the user experience of the user interface, I can say that it was a bit strange at first to be unable to press the homebutton directly and to get a haptic feedback. However, within a few hours, the habit has already settled in and it is now completely normal. For the rest of iOS I do not need to say anything. That's always the same. On the missing 3.5mm jack connection I would not like to go either, since here the ghosts divide. Conclusion: -------- All in all, I am extremely satisfied with this device and would like it do not miss anymore. It offers a very large display, which offers plenty of space for gambling or video viewing .. The camera quality is really amazing and has always convinced me. The workmanship is extremely high quality and you realize that you hold not only a plastic bomber in his hand the sound of the built-in stereo speakers is really good and completely sufficient. However, I recommend each buyer a suitable case and screen protector, as the repair prices for the iPhone 7 are some "pretty athletic". 5 stars from me and a clear Buy recommendation. I hope that I could help. :-)

Super fast processor, strong camera, huge battery and a great display. I already owned several Samsung and Apple devices but was not convinced by anybody. The only two criticisms are the super long charging time (which could be limited by a stronger USB adapter but limited) and the poor display surface ratio, which does not prove to be a problem for me by my comparatively large hands. The camera is just breathtaking !!!

Supplement: I noticed in nature shots when especially many green shades are here (eg: forest or trees only) because the camera is very overwhelmed ... is that only with me or with you too? as soon as houses or the sky is there, it's actually ... a forest photo is added ... the scenery (last photo) was photographed out of the train ... beautiful

7924	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	ChaosLeopard	5	Switch from the iPhone 6 Plus definitely worthwhile!	2017-02-12	de	For over 2 months I've been wondering which device is next to choose from, after spending 2 years intensively using the iPhone 6 Plus. The device itself was a very stable and above all powerful smartphone, but you noticed over time that the speed and the reaction to all controls turned out to be much too slow and delayed, so that I no longer enjoy using it. After years of use I had to calculate future plans, which device I will buy next in connection with a contract extension. Here was the following selection between the respective devices: The iPhone 7 Plus The iPhone SE (very famous currently and for the handy use highly recommended ) or the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE. As a Mac user of many years, I naturally had to consider many factors such as compatibility, in the case of a smartphone that is not offered by "Apple". I particularly liked the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE because of the curved display, which has a resolution of 2K and had a nice look and comfort in handling. Operating in combination with Android 6.0 surpassed all my expectations, and I was very enthusiastic about both software and conditionality with one hand, but I knew that using third party software on the Mac would be difficult, for example, updating or transferring data between the Mac and the smartphone. Due to numerous positive reviews, I decided for the S7.Befor I but the purchase graduated, I tended to iPhone 7 Plus, since I was especially fascinated by the dual camera with wide-angle optics. The pictures look really nice, but there was a big disadvantage compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which I am very annoyed to this day: The PRIZE! At Telekom employees extended a contract, filled out papers and fortunately still the last copy of the iPhone Get 7 Plus 128GB Matt Black.Although the purchase was a significant loss compared to my previous contract renewals including mobile phone change, but this has paid off well! In the course of this review, I would like to discuss various aspects of the iPhone 7 Plus, which make the smartphone to something very special and equally interesting At the end, draw a conclusion regarding all the listed areas. Design: The iPhone 7 Plus is similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 6 Plus or the 6S Plus. It consists of a 5.5-inch screen and looks really beautiful. In contrast to the predecessors, the back of the iPhone was slightly changed. The antenna strips, which were clearly recognizable on the iPhone 6 Plus or the 6S, have finally been removed on the 7 Plus. This gives the iPhone 7 Plus a good impression and a nice look thanks to the beautiful black value, which really stands out in the eye and entices the user to want to hold the device in his hands. For me it is clearly one of the most beautiful smartphones that have been released on the market so far. But it gets me full marks, if one neglects the aspect of fingerprints! Homebutton: A new home button simplifies the condition on the iPhone and responds relatively quickly to the controls of the user. If the user presses the "sensor" button (a button does not exist anymore), the device generates a slight vibration, which redirects the device to the original home screen. Within the settings it is possible to interpret different sensitivities of the sensor which, when actuated, either cause a more intense vibration or completely switch it off. If you want to do without the Taptic engine, you can easily configure it in the settings, but personally I find the new home button to be very successful and offers you what the old home button could not do: it prevents the durability of the home button wears off over time. The Taptic Engine has been developed for future use to simplify the use of the device and prevent subsequent damage at high pressure.My homebutton at that time could no longer recognize the exact pressure force, so I was forced to increase the intensity, which of course was bad for the key. Now you can do without, because the new development regarding the sensor works really well. I really like the Homebutton and it makes the condition of the iPhone enormously easier Speaker: The new stereo speakers have really been provided with excellent acoustics, which sound even deeper and more intense deep bass in the individual, built-in speakers and make progress from the sound Has. My current ringtone is much louder as well as sonorous to hear, which is why many music genres are issued much clearer musically. I like the speakers very well. If you want, you can of course use the included headphones. The new A10 with 64-bit architecture and 3GB of memory give the iPhone again a strong performance boost over its predecessors by up to 50%. The iPhone runs like the world champion and scores a peak in the benchmark. Games and applications are presented very fluently and never fall into a jerk. Even appearing messages during gaming did not affect the speed of the iPhone under any circumstances. It responds wonderfully and seems to be drastically optimized compared to my iPhone 6 Plus. The quad-core processor handles various tasks quickly and safely. You definitely do not have to worry about that as a power user. Very good !!! Camera: The new dual camera with wide-angle optics offers a nice result in terms of the photos taken both inside and outside. The camera works relatively quickly and shows very good pictures even in low light conditions, but in bad light can ambiguous individual Verzehrrungen form, which at the expense of image quality, unfortunately, no longer offer what is normally expected of such a camera. Since I personally liked the shots on the S7 much better, but leave the pictures a great and high-quality impression. 4K videos are like the iPhone 6S possible and look amazingly good, especially if my 4K has suitable screen, with which you can marvel at the videos. For amateur photographers is certainly something good here! Personally, I use the camera relatively little, but I try sometimes times to deal with the creation of photos, as soon as good opportunities should occur.Akkulaufzeit: Strong processor, high memory, good speakers also take the battery power of the iPhone. Since I purchased the device only this afternoon, I can mention relatively little information at runtime. The iPhone had about 68% on the first launch. After 6 hours of use remained a remaining battery of 38%, which I think are good results for such an expensive smartphone. Apple promises in contrast to its predecessor up to an hour longer battery life, which I can not confirm, but I'm convinced that the information was really given correctly. If other evidence contradicts this statement, I add this retroactively to the recession.Otherwise, I'm very excited about the battery life for the already 6 hours. Let's see how much this changes after the fact. Memory: This time around, I was 100% sure that I would access a larger capacity than before with the iPhone 6 Plus, which has put a lot of strain on me personally in everyday life. I switched from the 16GB version to 128GB (ie: 112GB of additional memory), of which 120GB are available to the user when preinstalled applications like Keynote or Numbers are removed. Currently only 8GB including music, some photos, iCloud photo and transferred applications from iTunes occupied, which I was very excited about myself, since I can now claim the memory for memory-heavy applications and prove, without wasting a thought that possibly the memory exceeds its limits. If you should opt for an iPhone 7 Plus (especially for the iPhone 7 Plus), please consider whether 32GB is the right choice. After all, initially 4GB occupied by the system. Whether the purchase is worthwhile, everyone has their own thoughts about it. If you got along well with 16GB, where, for example, a small number of applications as well as small shots were created or only a few media libraries were continuously accessed, then the 32 GB could possibly cope. I recommend all other 128GB version (maybe even 256GB), since the new camera including the functions and applications nowadays take a lot of memory and the system could definitely slow down after a few months due to performance. The more data that is stored on the iPhone, the longer the loading time. Before buying, I ask everyone once to think about which variant applies to you, even if it is 100 € more expensive. Better to have more memory for safety and have no problems than to complain later and be forced to transfer data regularly or even remove. Such a thing disturbs in the long run and can cost a lot of time and nerves. 128GB should be for most standard. I do not regret the 128GB so far. Memory can not be expanded with the help of an SD card like its predecessors. Color: Usually I wanted to buy the diamond version of the iPhone, but users on the internet seem to complain that after a short period of 1 - 3 months, tiny traces of wear or even Yellowed deposits are formed so that the appearance of the iPhone is no longer the mint condition, as it was the case in the beginning. I must confess that the diamond version of the iPhone 7 Plus was no longer available and the seller has instead proposed the matte-black variant. On his advice, I accepted the offer and must confess that the color inspires me as much as the diamond version. For safety's sake, I use two bulletproof glass foils to prevent the device from making huge losses. This is a very expensive copy which I do not want to use "naked". Especially after 2 years Apple again offers an upgrade offer, where the old device can be exchanged for the new one. Significant traces of use, the estimated due to the serious and long-term use can fluctuate up to 50 €, which is a strong loss in my opinion.For the 6 Plus, I got from Telekom still 220 ¬. The 7 Plus will probably cost around € 300 to € 400 if I try hard to be careful. Maybe I'll buy a Case soon, although I like the iPhone quite well at the moment, despite the missing case. Let's hope that after a few months there are no surprises that would disappoint me very much of the product. Now we come to a point that bothers me a bit: The lack of headphone connection made for some users for reviews. The supplied adapter creates a remedy, but I would not like to pose in my spare time with an adapter that fills the trouser pocket again. How this manifests itself in practice, I learn only tomorrow on the train. I find it very disappointing that the headphone jack was left out, although I'm convinced I'm getting used to it. It is also criticized that the sound quality in combination with the adapter is reduced a lot. This, too, I can only determine from a later date. Whether Apple hereby want to draw attention to the wireless peripherals? Summary: Pro + High quality editing + Great new Homebutton + Great speakers + Excellent dual camera with great pictures + Good battery life + Beautiful color + iOS 10 with great new featuresKontra- Missing headphone jack camera images in low light conditions a little noisy Still, no NFC in Germany (Actually a pity: Hopefully this will be announced in the coming months) - High SAR value of 1.27W / KG (Whether this could have negative consequences for humans in terms of medical and biological development can Unfortunately, I do not confirm that, according to the German limits, devices with a maximum SAR value of 1.6 or 1.5 W / kg are dangerous but not life-threatening, so Apple could definitely have done more, but you can basically not have everything!) Conclusion: A successful smartphone if not even the best that Apple has to offer. The performance has exceeded all expectations, the camera offers good pictures and a good battery life for long-term users. The iPhone 7 Plus convinces in different areas and leaves a positive impression. The purchase of the device has paid off in my opinion, and can be recommended without any restriction. For those who can not decide between the iPhone 6S Plus and the 7 Plus, or 6S and 7: Always try the newest option into consideration pull. So you have a longer  support and can use all the features that already exist on the 6S, with the purchase of the 7 or 7 Plus further developed. Personally, I also wanted the 6S variant, as the 6 plus 2 years had accompanied me well and only an increased storage capacity was required, yet I opted for the iPhon 7 Plus to be surprised for the next few years with great new features and Benefit from the optimization in terms of performance and especially the dual camera. All users who use an iPhone 6 Plus should think about buying the 7 Plus. Owner of a 6S Plus I do not recommend the purchase, as the iPhone 6s Plus is still a top smartphone and can keep up with the competition. Owners of older models, "" can "think about a change, if performance losses or lack of storage are not in the obstacle. Otherwise: Clear Buy recommendation! Yours sincerelyChaosLeopard

This was granted only after the involvement of Amazon another 2 days later. Stay away from rigenerati srl !!!
7928	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Gustav Gans	5	The iPhone 7 Plus is not the nicest smartphone on the market, but certainly one of the best	2017-03-20	de	The iPhone 7 Plus is not the nicest smartphone on the market. It may not be equipped with the fastest hardware. It may not have the best camera. But bottom line for me again the best device on the market. It's the many little things that make the device very good. The design is getting old. Nevertheless, I feel good again when you hold it in your hands. The processing is first class and still the measure on which the other providers must be measured. The display has "only" Full HD resolution, but the bottom line is very good. It is bright, crisp and sharp and has excellent color reproduction. The working speed is excellent. Everything "slips" and works as it should. What really stands out in comparison with the Mate 9, my previous smartphone. Open apps Fast, pages are displayed quickly. The Mate 9 was also fast, in most cases, but the iPhone 7 is simply faster. Or if it should be slower, it is cleverer that it works faster. The iPhone 7 Plus just works. In the car, on the ear, on the train, in the office. It always works when I need it. That was the main reason for the change. It works well in vehicles that change jobs because of regular traffic. Whether Audi, Seat, Peugeot, Skoda, Mercedes, the device is detected. Music is played via Bluetooth. The streaming works perfectly. The handsfree, so the phone, works right away. Important for me, working notifications, especially for emails and Threema. Unfortunately, that's what the Mate 9 did. There is nothing to complain about at the iPhone 7 Plus, it just works. Telephoning works first class. Crystal clear reception with the Vodafone network in the areas where I am staying. No disconnections, no complaints from my counterpart. So I expect das.Die built camera in the iPhone 7 Plus is good and stands out clearly from the Mate 9. Only the camera app of the Mate 9 I miss. But the picture quality, especially in darker situations, is much better. Not as good as my Note 7 or maybe the Pixel XL, but it's at an absolute top level. Battery life is remarkable. I can easily get over a day, despite much smaller battery compared to the Mate 9! What I do not like? The lack of 3.5mm connection I miss tremendously. I refuse the ugly Ear Pods and this stupid adapter is for the jack connection is a cheek. The camera sink, ugly like six feet dirt road. The price, just too high. But the iPhones are relatively stable in value compared to Android devices. Do I make the purchase? I miss a bit the beloved Android OS, just in its purest form. So on a Nexus or Pixel Smartphone. The Pixel XL was not available at the time, so it became the iPhone 7 Plus. To my surprise, a lot has happened on iOS too. So the surface was cleaned up a bit. The Maps app has gotten more features, similar to Google Maps, and the display goes off when you pick up the iPhone. Little things, just those little things in buzzer that make the device better than many other devices on the market. Even though I still miss my grade 7.
7929	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Michael Merfels	1	IPhone, American scrap	2017-06-21	de	Never again iPhone junk. I ordered an iPhone 7 Plus with 128gb, the phone arrived pretty quickly, but sent in a joke package from Amazon itself, as one would expect from a 900 ¬ article, cheap and in no way appropriate , I opened the packaging and had to notice that on the phone the minus button was pressed to adjust the volume and could not be pulled out. And with a brand new phone for 900 ¬, no idea how something with Apple comes through the final inspection. I sent it back immediately and I'm curious how it works with the refund. But the very best is coming first. I thought that somehow it could happen and ordered the same phone again. After a week, the article was delivered, however, since I was not at home, to the neighbors. When I picked up the package, also in the same lousy, cheap Amazon packaging in the evening, I immediately noticed that the box was open at the side. I opened it now on the zipper and on the Handykarton the protective foil was not any longer off, but lay crumpled beside it. After opening the cell phone box almost hit me to sleep, the accessories were completely available, but the phone was stolen from the box, was probably taken out of the side of the cheap packaging and put back after removing the phone. After several phone calls and e-mails with the Amazon Hotline I was told that Amazon does not replace the phone because they allegedly sent the article properly! I have turned my lawyer on and now things are going to court. So if you think Amazon would be a reputable store I have to teach unfortunately a better. I will continue to report

Ultimately, it is for me a phone with email reception. And here is the problem. Every second call I hear Hello, hello I can not understand you !!! It does not matter if I have the device on my ear or make a call via the handsfree function. Sorry apple, the device is not useful for calling.
7931	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Markus H.	5	Be happy, feel life	2016-10-01	de	Know the moment when you open a bottle of red wine, smell it and think, "" It's going to taste so good "" Imagine you've never had a red wine before and just heard about it, it just tastes fantastic , You sip for the first time and realize: How could I have missed that for so long? So you feel like you own an iPhone, even as the owner of the whole product range. I myself was a skeptic for years and did not understand the hype about the Apple brand, but since I myself am owner and user of drs Ipads 1, the Ipads Air, the Imacs 27k, the Iphones SE, and since today Iphones 7 Plus, must I say: MY BRAND FOR LIFE. I do not want to go into any detail here, as many others do, but for the simple non-tech savvy, I want to make it clear that you just will not regret it. That's the point, why I can only say again: if you can, buy Apple products. Not to present a status but to be happy. You will not be disappointed.
7932	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Mika	3	Very expensive pile of electronics.	2017-01-24	de	I can honestly not understand this Apple hype. I've also dared after 3 years Blackberry with OS10 to get me such a Eierphone because I did not want an android and there is nothing else that I like it. It's amazing what Starting with a Bluetooth device to send photos to a photo printer, does not work! Send files at all via Bluetooth, is not! Mp3 just as a ringtone, does not work! Create folder , do not work! Device s.Calculator stuck, copy files back and forth, does not work! What's useful in the 7 plus is the camera, the battery, the display and the support, but that's it already. And it comes to me no one with IOS would be safe, sure is not even a smartphone. But that's just my personal opinion of course, everyone sees it differently. Shame the Blackberry has gone over to Android and looks like OS10 can fall asleep!

What I noticed, however: -The display scratched very fast without foil, I have never had a slide on my iPhone displays and never had to detect as many scratches as with the iPhone 7 Plus. With such an expensive device, I would have expected more inconsistency.-When talking on the phone, you always rip off some hair. The gap where the display is installed with the housing is so large that hang in my phone while my hair. (Very annoying and painful)
7934	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	JoJo	5	Apple iPhone 7 plus review	2016-12-09	de	What's new, neither the design nor the dimensions. Apple had become used to changing the look of the iPhone with each new generation. This is not the case here. IPhone 7 is the same as the iPhone 6 and 6S. Also, similarity between the 6S Plus and 7 Plus. No difference in terms of liability ... Except that these new arrivals are waterproof, that makes a big difference. As we have seen, they can safely be left in the pool, splashing and even dipping in water (1 meter deep) for 30 minutes, they still work. It is however to be allowed to dry for at least 5 hours before charging. But beware: like any waterproof electronic device, the water resistance is limited to freshwater. The main developments: - The main button is not mechanical, but detects finger pressure.- Analog audio output goes: you use a Bluetooth headset, go through the Flash-mini connector adapter or invest in a lightning hit helmet.- The battery provides greater autonomy, one to two hours more compared to the iPhone 6S depending on use.- Same design, cleared audio output- The same screen The more flattering- The same camera and brighter- Two goals for the iPhone 7 Plus- The sound in stereo, the same headphones in digital format- Faster and more generous battery processorConcentrate on two goals: The most spectacular development concerns that the iPhone 7 plus has two goals, a wide angle of 28mm and 56mm 2x zoom. Just tap the 2x icon to switch to the screen shown to enlarge it. Hold your finger down and drag, you can still take pictures up to 10X, but then the digital zoom takes over. The same system also works in video and in idle mode, fast, space and panorama.The idea is interesting: 2X, the subject appears closer, without the image through the grain and the possibility of the affected gradually zoom provides more freedom in video. However, the quality deteriorates when the zoom performance too, especially in low light. IPhone 7 And: like the zoom with two goals (Answer: good): Other manufacturers also take in the two goals, starting with the excellent Huawei P9 of the camera , and take the opportunity to add new features, such as blurring in the background or foreground. The iPhone 7 plus does not offer this option, but Apple will ensure that it will be available in a planned update in a few weeks. Reportedly, the camera may then emphasize the blur in the background, but will not be able to create a blur in the foreground. What I think ... If you want to summarize the main advantage of the new iPhone, we finally say "a waterproof iPhone." "This is the first Apple phone that is also resistant to splashing, which forced a bath in one meter of water. Nothing to worry about, so if the unit falls into the toilet bowl. For the rest, we discover some more anecdotal enhancements like the new main button, the stereo speakers, or brighter camera. The disappearance of the audio jack is not as terrible as that. First, because you always have to connect headphones to the adapter's flash mini Connection can connect, also because more and more people are using Bluetooth headphones and finally, because the audio quality is better, with headphones connected to the jack lightning which have their own digital converter. Finally, rather regret the lack of technology "" wow " ", or at least we would have better accepted if the iPhone 7 marked a break in terms of design. But this is not the case. The case is the same as the iPhone 6 and 6S. So it comes back to the most important innovation of this model: If you need a waterproof iPhone, iPhone 7 is an excellent choice. Other innovations will probably be in the iPhone 8.Also the end of 2018 appears iPhone 8, but who can not wait so long then I recommend iPhone 7 !!
7935	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	miknkia	3	From the perspective of a former Android user	2017-07-03	de	For a week I own the iPhone 7 Plus and am satisfied but not enthusiastic. Previously, I only ever had cheaper smartphones (Android). But my last cell phone got on my nerves at some point so that I wanted to buy a new one. This time I wanted to treat myself something high quality. First, the choice should fall on the Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. Since I did not like the quality of the phone but I bought an iPhone 7 Plus.Bisher I had only heard good things about the iPhone 7 Plus and decided relatively quickly for me without informing me more. However, that was a mistake, because only afterwards I noticed the following negative points: - The Iphone has no back button (super-nervous, because you can never go back a step, if one has clicked, bad luck.) - The battery does not hold As long as promised, it will last a maximum of 8 hours with mediocre use. My Asus Zenfone, with whom I was not satisfied, kept much longer.- I can not delete a letter when I am committed to a word, but I have to rewrite the whole word - very time-consuming.- The Appstore has far not to offer as much as the Playstore.- the Iphone costs a whopping 850 ¬ and I see no significant difference to a 250 ¬ device. The surcharge is not worth it. What I've noticed positively: - the camera has a good quality- the operating system is fast- noble design- Siri and Facetime are goodies that are fun and that only exists on the Iphone. The iphone is in my opinion very overpriced and offers simply too little for the price, since other cheaper mobile phones are just as good. I would not get it again. The next phone will be an android again! Do not understand the hype around the iphone at all.
7936	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Kundenrezensent	5	Attention: Required SIM card not included	2016-11-14	de	After an unpleasant experience of a car accident resulting in an incomprehensible condemnation to a partial guilt, I informed myself about the possibilities of digital recording to substantiate disputed accident situations. Since I wanted a good image resolution and a certain compactness, I decided against a chunky digital camera and instead for this compact iPhone 7 Plus with additional phone function with suction cup windshield mount, especially since this dual camera had aroused my curiosity. After attaching to the windshield above my Steering wheel were my driving experience by the permanent sideways looking past the device holding the head rather painful nature. If this device turned out to be a little smaller, such compulsions would certainly be avoidable. However, the image quality convinced me a lot that I quickly took the decision to keep my iPhone. Only a so-called SIM card (as I later learned) was still missing to total happiness, as this unfortunately had not included the delivery. So I decided to visit my electronics store in the Neuköllner Karl-Marx-Straße. I bought this SIM card to finally use this phone function. But when I returned to my parking lot, a huge hole in my windshield gaped. The sucker and the phone were gone. Since I realized that I had not only imagined that with the high weight of the 7 Plus. Now I knew what the plus stood for. It was apparently broken by the heavy weight of the disc. I was sad about the now useless SIM. At home I had tears in my eyes. Not because of the loss, but rather because of the wind. I asked the honest finder and rescuer of my iPhone by newspaper advertisement to hand it over at the next opportunity in the lost property office. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting today. Maybe he will read this review.

7939	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Susann Roßberg	2	No chance against Samsung!	2017-04-16	de	My personal opinion about the iPhone 7plus 128 GB results from the handling with the device. I was already disappointed in the unpacking, because the device, from the point of view, was clearly below my expectations. The device can not be used without SIM even! The next sobering point. A device for 900 ¬, which can not even activate via Wi-Fi and a SIM for the initial installation requires is already brazen.The reception was at the same location 2 bars (points) worse and instead of LTE, there was only 3G. Audio files from the PC could not be transferred to the iPhone because the phone is not recognized. A Syncronisation went only over iTunes Store at the PC. At the same time 3 albums have completely disappeared! The device has the very good and bright display and the decent sound via headphones, which unfortunately can only be connected via the cheap adapter. Simultaneous headphone operation and charging the battery does not work. The launcher can also be personalized by far not as in Android devices. The missing "" return "" button was the k.o. Argument, because you just push away apps but not really close. The device goes back. My first iPhone was sobering! Where does this hype come from?

The significantly larger display represents a real added value; especially if you use the device intensively professionally and read many mails with attachments. That the processor is faster and the RAM is larger than in the 6s, you do not notice in normal operation. Both devices work (subjectively perceived) the same liquid. The sound is due to the stereo speakers much better and richer and you have a clearly audible stereo effect. The battery life is sensational. 1-2 days are easy in it, even with intensive use.
7953	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Moonlight	5	Again and again the iPhone	2019-01-06	de	When I got the iPhone 7+ in October 2017 on Amazon, I was fascinated from the first moment. I had the 6s before, wanted to have a bigger and more powerful iPhone. The 7+ has everything in the usual good Apple quality: very good workmanship and handling, great camera, very good configuration, everything runs smoothly (at 6 s was often absolutely not the case!). Despite the size it fits well in the hand and can be operated with one hand (if you do not have little fingers). The adapter headphone port bothers me, unlike other users, not at all. You have to load it every other day, the 6s had to be loaded every day. Basically, I am convinced again and again of the Apple quality and operation, with Android, I would not cope! I am very satisfied and do not want another iPhone at the moment.

7961	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Argent 	pianoforte	5	Great display and high working speed	2018-03-27	de	The iPhone 7 Plus has replaced my 6s Plus. For the change were crucial, the new home button, the new camera with two lenses, the splash and dust protection, the brighter display, the higher working speed and the built-in stereo speakers. Initially, I thought I stick to my iPhone 6s Plus, because that was but quickly and the camera has made great shots. But after I got in the course of a contract extension, the iPhone 7 Plus and tested, the decision was made, the new features outweighed in daily use just clearly. The new home button including fingerprint sensor is much faster and has a crisp pressure point, which is only imitated by a slight vibration, a pressing is no longer taking place at all. This allows a much faster unlocking of the iPhone. The new dual-lens camera is now equipped with a larger aperture f 1.9 and a kind of telephoto lens. The larger aperture low-light images are possible because the larger aperture leaves more light on the recording sensor. The telephoto has a zoom level and zooms the subject about 50% closer, the quality of the recording suffers in terms of sharpness and detail. The new portrait function only works well in good light conditions, ie daylight and sunlight. In closed rooms, the iPhone and the subject must remain shake-free, otherwise the recording is rather blurred. Overall, the camera in the iPhone 7 Plus compared to the 6s Plus did not convince me 100%. I found the shots with the 6s Plus sharper and more contrasty. The sound of the two built-in speakers is clear and distortion-free, bass lack of volume, of course, not available, but a good surround sound at higher volume. The working speed of the iPhone 7 Plus is great, no jerking , everything runs smoothly and opens without delay. Also the reception and voice quality is perfect. WLAN and Bluetooth connect quickly with the respective peripheral devices, the transmission quality is also perfect here. The display, its sharpness, resolution and brightness is still State of the art, even in sunlight, it is easy to read. Overall, the iPhone 7 Plus is rated as very good, the aluminum back of the case contributes, I personally find it more robust and insensitive than a glass back.
7962	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Yando_SB	4	Detailed review of the innovations	2016-11-18	de	I work a lot with smartphones from any manufacturer, so I know what I'm talking about and I would like to offer all interested parties the best possible assistance with this review. Since not too much has changed in comparison to the previous model, I would like to respond to these changes exactly The first dual camera in an iPhone, and they take beautiful pictures! The depth of field effect is a great innovation that is (unfortunately) only available for the plus model. I'm just wondering why? It is created on the software side, that would create any current iPhone. The front camera only resolves higher and is now also suitable for really useful self-portraits shoot. Definitely timely. Homebutton: unlike the predecessor models, you no longer press a physical button. The pressure of a fingerprint is simulated by the pressure of a Force Touch surface accompanied by a vibration of the new Taptic engine. What that brings? Buttons wear out, the new surface does not wear! However, she ALWAYS needs main contact! No touch pen, no smartphone phone shoes, a living finger! Negative I just noticed the use in my car mount, because you have to push harder than a normal button and I have often shifted the bracket. Taptic Engine: Really great innovation. That a slight vibration feedback in the lower part of the phone can feel so cool, I never thought so far, because the vibration not only simulates the push of a button, it gives, for example, feedback if you on the classic selection rollers (eg birthday / TT / MM / YYYY) Scrolls. Again, the device vibrates easily between the choices, as with a mechanical Rad.Dual Speaker / Speaker: Blades in any case better than any other iPhone. The sound is clearer and much louder than before, and now finally in stereo, which has me as Youtube lovers with the most pleased.Even if the upper speaker (in the earpiece) is a whole corner quieter, convinced the entire Klangbild.Vegfall the headphone jack: It can be argued about. 2 Disadvantages It comes to music over standard headphones only via the free adapter supplied and no way to listen to music loading (without additional accessories). Grade Plus model has such a strong battery that I still had 10% battery after 30 hours without charging plug, with much benefit, energy-saving mode from 20%. Then you prepare yourself, and hand on heart, how often does the situation actually occur? Everyone has to decide for themselves. The new colors: I am cautious about black iPhones. The black machine of my colleague showed after two weeks of very careful use of the first scratches on the back, even Apple itself admits the sensitivity and takes no responsibility for blemishes. Attention! Whether the matte black will look as beautiful as on the first day will remain to be seen, the black powder coating of the iPhone 5 rubbed off after some time, whether with or without Schutzhülle.Preis: I think my buys with an iPhone not only the device As such, but also the perfection of software / hardware tuning, at least 4 years the Latest iOS Updated and a processing of their peers is looking for. Why are there no virus scanners in the store on iOS? Because you do not need one! There is no safer mobile operating system, point. 900 € are perhaps a little high for the smallest version of the Plus models, but I do not rate the price here but the product. Conclusion: The innovations are definitely a step in the right direction, even the omission of the headphone jack. We are moving into a wireless future. If you can do without the above mentioned innovations and who the price is still too high, you can use the predecessor model, which is now also available with 32GB memory and is a good 150 € cheaper.
7963	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Argent 	Mrssam	5	Perfect	2017-06-28	de	My first Apple product. I'm thrilled, the attitude was a bit difficult because I did not know that, but with a little help, even beginners can handle this phone. The quality is awesome and the resolution of pictures is very good. The sound is very clear and loud. I am very satisfied and understand the hype around the iPhone now more than before. It's just something high quality.
7964	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Daniel Neuhauser	5	First and certainly not my last iPhone	2016-11-04	de	== Background == As previously loyal Samsung customer and therefore Android users, IOS and thus an iPhone was never a topic for me. My last smartphone was the Galaxy Note 4, the anticipation of the note 7 was great, the rest should The decision, which I really did not find it easy to switch to an Iphone, was long thought out and should be quasi a pilot project for me. Below I will only comment on my experiences, technical details and comparisons can be found in the product description = The transition == Much easier and less complicated than expected.iPhone start - during the configuration "" Transfer data from Android "" - ready (free "" move to IOS "" previously download the app to the Android device) For iPhone Newcomers is the operation at first a little unfamiliar because new, after 3-4 days, but this is no longer a problem dar. My worries that I will miss the pen were in vain. Since one had the luxury of Samsung devices, the To expand memory via SD, I have decided for the 128GB version, since I've already used a SD in this size at the Note 4 (photos, music, movies, etc.). Whether the smaller version is sufficient, should be good at the purchase == The iPhone in everyday life == Yes, it looks really good, feels great, feels good in the hand and is certainly the best smartphone on the market Qualitatively. In the home Office I use only Windows and the interaction between PC and iPhone works flawlessly. Also, the applications installed on the iPhone such as Word, Excel Outlook, etc. run perfectly and are super to use. == Camera Battery, etc. == Absolutely terrific, there are There is nothing to criticize. The quality of the speakers is unique. You can compare this with any of my previous smartphones and it is really fun to watch videos on the device. The included headphones are also s strong and deliver a great sound. The screen is great and more than adequate. 4k or even higher-resolution display's on a smartphone are for me personally completely meaningless. Another luxury I thought to miss, namely the removable Akku.Nein, I do not miss it until now. With normal use of the iPhone, my battery can easily last a full 4 days - the biggest surprise for me. I've been a user of Google Play Music so far iPhone would be possible. After a short test phase of "" Apple Music "" Google was terminated. Operation and especially the structure of the Apple version is a lot better and clearer. == Conclusion == Who plays with the idea to dare a change from Android to IOS, that said, I can recommend it to anyone. Finally It's a matter of taste, because now the price no major differences are more recognizable. The added value but expected of Apple, is absolutely given. You immediately notice that you hold a top-of-the-range smartphone in your hands. I do not regret the change for a second.
7965	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Schuli	4	Only meant for big hands	2017-09-21	de	After I got the successor model every two years since the 1st Iphone, meanwhile I have reached the iPhone 7 too. Size pretty much identical to the Iphone 6+, operation has not changed much, except the double touch (press harder on the screen for subordinate functions) Battery runtime has not improved much, and the battery can be synonymous as with all previous models nach.Was annoying, is the camera, which unfortunately protrudes on the back. This can put the phone on the bedside table unsightly. Also, what the hell did Apple think about leaving the Aux socket away? Design-technical reasons may not have had it. Viell. Think back to the iPhone 8 again. By and large, the performance, speed and system stability has been improved. Who is on Apple, eh not around it anyway :-)
7966	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	4	A "little" masterpiece with shortcomings.	2016-11-28	de	I bought the iPhone 7+ in the color, black. And I have to say, I'm thrilled. Optics: The Disgn is simple and noble, and that's what I like about the iPhone 7.Man has a piece of the latest and most modern technology in hand but is not so great (So not for people who want to show that they have a NEW iPhone). Technology: With the A10, Apple has built a processor that is not only extremely fast but also energy efficient , and one learns to appreciate this quickly because it is good, even if just, by 2 days, with a battery charge, comes.Betriebssystem: Well, I'm not a fan of the new IOS 10 but each his sein.Ich only say, it adapts pretty well to the iPhone 7, especially the plus one. (But I think that should look at each one himself) Camera: With the camera, you can only say it is great, and that was again Time after the Galaxy s6 / 7 (which have left the iPhone miles away). But how can you say it? Apple is back in the game and with a good Vorsprung.Die camera convinces with a real color representation, choice modes, good lowlight and extreme sharpness.MANKO: Apple has announced that the radiation levels of the iPhone are quite high and in my opinion this should not be the case with a 2016 smartphone. (You can read more on the Apple website) I hope I could help you.P.I am 16 so my review also appeals to this age group.
7967	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Rose Gold	Moa	5	ok, do what it should	2016-11-02	de	After I've updated every year to the current version of the iphones, I could not resist this time and I ordered the 7 plus with 128GB at Telekom. This time it took quite a long time and with just under 3 weeks delay it was then delivered. After the 6 plus and 6s plus, the display is no longer really off the stool. The camera is ok, but now not so super outstanding, as praised in the press or advertised by this more for apple. Compared to the 6s plus, the pictures are a bit more lively and the switch from normal to 2x zoom is well resolved. Just 2 hours ago, apple released the beta version for profile photography and the first results are nice. Too bad that this feature, which was already advertised in the press (and actually could not be tested yet) was not on board from the beginning. That the homebutton is simulated does not really bother. Also, I can live with the omission of the latch, I'm not now the Walkmantyp. For me is more important wireless connectivity and works flawlessly in a recent Audi with the latest MMI, whether via Bluetooth to make calls, via bluetooth audio player or now also perfectly wireless via the MMI App. Also, the WLAN connection seems to have been improved again, in some corners of our house where I had only moderate reception, the reception is much improved. The stability of the ios 10 + update is good, so far I could not find a trailer. The scrolling in the e-mail app is also jerky with 10.1.1 .. I'm curious if now the problem with the battery performance is resolved, although I have everything on manual and the background balance off, the battery currently holds just under 25 -30 hours. The 6s plus with Ios 9.x easily lasts a day longer with similar usage. The 2nd loudspeaker makes itself clearly noticeable, the ringtone is clearly louder now. I see the much-praised improved design more soberly when the case scratched more heavily. And what brings me Diamantblack, if I have to pull a protective cover over it in 12 months, if necessary, again for a good price to sell again. My conclusion: Was there a real Wow in the jump from iphone 5s to 6plus because of the screen. A bit Wow, because of the live function at the 6plus on the 6s plus. So now you have the feeling to have a new iphone in your pocket, it is also recognized by the larger camera immediately, but somehow missing a bit the mega apple WOW despite more memory 128GB, stereo speakers, splash protection and improved cameras. I do difficult to award me 5 stars, maybe it is because the previous devices were already very good and the iOS 10 this time was thrown too fast on the market and the customer matures. Update to Update 10.1.1 .: The profile picture function is great , have tested these extensively today with our kiddies. Two images are saved, one with and one without depth of field. The pictures are really great. So here is the WOW experience again :-). Also, the battery is now much better. Within 20 hours since the update, the battery still has an output of 85%.
7968	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	A.K.	5	More than enthusiastic	2017-02-09	de	This is my first iPhone. I wanted to consciously have the plus, since I was convinced of the camera and am. I am quick and easy handling for me in the smartphone sector unequaled (until now). Especially moving shots look incredibly good (equestrian sports, dogs, etc.) .The portrait function is great, even if Apple was not the first company on the market there. Even in low light conditions, the camera conjures up good pictures that also please, without much needs to be edited. The handling takes some getting used to, because the size of the phone was not commonplace / is. Personally, I got used to it and also to the weight. Amazing, I find how easy then other smartphones are (eg my old SonyZ3 Compact or Nexus 4 and the 5s of my girlfriend). They also feel like doll phones and you think: Somehow cheap. The home button works wonderfully, quickly and accurately. Apps open quickly and generally iOS 10 can do a lot. Touch 3D was new for me as an iPad owner and now I have the hang of it. Brightness, images and operation are at Apple anyway at the highest level, so no deductions.128 GB had to be with me as a Spotify user. I do more videos than photos and that goes into the memory size violently. So you can also load apps that one needs only once, but still do not want to miss. Critically, I think the missing jack connection. At least I do not charge the iPhone and listen to music in parallel, but for the good headphones rauszuholen the adapter, sometimes annoys me. Meanwhile, I can live with it and also that is clear to any buyer before. I am also fascinated by the battery performance of this technology bomber. I spend 2 days relaxing with music, games, surfing and phoning. Charged the part is synonymous schnell.Empfehlen I can the leather case of Apple itself, it costs more, feels better processed and has saved me from harm. In addition, the glass sheet of Belkin (I think) and you have a round Schutz.Das subject price - Apple built performance and comparison with other manufacturers is irrelevant here, because I get nowhere such a package with other manufacturers. Whether IP67, IP68 IP LMAA is me Schnuppe, I do not shower with Phone and do not swim with it. Who buys an iPhone, knows what he gets and is willing to dig deeper into the bag.
7969	iPhone 7 Plus	256GB	Black	Mr.Viking	5	Great evolution of a very good smartphone	2016-10-30	de	I've been using the iPhone 7 Plus for several weeks now and would like to record my experiences for anyone who is thinking of buying one. First in a compact overview of the positive and negative impressions, then in detail .---------------------------------- --------- Positive impressions: (+) more environmentally friendly packaging (+) Scope of supply (power supply, charging cable, headphones and headphone adapter) (+) further developed design (+) new memory sizes (+) new home button (+) IP 67 Certified (+) Processor (+) Dual Camera * Sample images taken and edited by myself * (+) Display (+) Battery (+) Stereo Speakers (+) Accessories DiversityNegative Impressions: (-) Missing Headphone Jack (-) High Price (-) Display margins ------------------------------------------- <<< Packaging >> > The box is a cardboard box typical of Apple with a picture of the iPhone on the front and model information on the back. The cardboard box is wrapped in a plastic wrap. This year, less plastic has been used inside. Thus, the packaging is recyclable to a higher proportion, which I find very welcome. <<< Scope of delivery >>> The scope of supply includes, as always, a power adapter, charging cable, a pair of headphones with Lightning connector and a 3.5mm jack to Lightning adapter. In addition, as always, the paperwork and Apple stickers are included. <<< Design >>> The design is based on the predecessor models iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus. The case is made of anodised aluminum as in the last years. New features are the offset antenna strips, a new dual-camera system and the omitted headphone jack. Although that only sounds like minor changes, the device looks like a completely new design, at least in the case of my iPhone 7 Plus in matte black. The antenna strips are color matched so that they almost disappear and in the color (dull) black, the iPhone can optically somewhere between elegant and wicked classify. <<< Memory >>> 16 GB finally fall away and with memory sizes of 32, 128 and 256 GB is the right size for everyone. Please note that the read and write speeds of 128 and 256 GB are faster than those of the 32 GB version, which is noticeable in everyday life but at most when syncing with iTunes -> videos are available on YouTube <<< Homebutton >>> The new Solid State Homebutton is one of my new favorite features because it is superior to the old mechanical Homebutton in everything and is comparable to the Force Touch trackpad of the current MacBook models. It reacts faster, is less prone to wear and contributes to IP67 certification. I love it after a short period of getting used to. <<< IP67 certification >>> Even if Apple does not guarantee water damage, the IP67 certification (30 minutes at up to 1m depth waterproof) calms me a lot. Although I would not deliberately go into the water on the basis of several testimonials on YouTube, I feel much more comfortable now when it rains in torrents, so I am near water or take it in the bathtub. In addition, it is completely dust-proof. <<< Processor >>> Apple's new A10 Fusion chip, in conjunction with 3GB of memory, is a real powerhouse, outperforming all its competitors in benchmarks.In everyday use, you immediately notice that the computing power of this smartphone is enormous. Nothing jolts or hangs and even the most elaborate games, such as "Infinite Blade III", run absolutely smoothly. <<< Dual Camera >>> The new camera with two lenses and sensors puts everything that has been on a smartphone into the shade. As usual for an iPhone, the color reproduction is absolutely phenomenal and extremely realistic, which I really like. Due to the two cameras (28mm and 56mm) a loss-free zoom of 2x is possible with the "Telelinse" u and it will be less awkward to shoot medullary shots. With the new portrait mode, in which both cameras work together with the software to produce depth of field similar to a SLR camera, you can take very nice photos *** I upload some of my sample images - all are unedited, like the iPhone it has recorded *** <<< Display >>> The new 5.5-inch display still resolves in full HD, but can clearly represent more colors, has a better black level and is significantly brighter in automatic brightness mode than its predecessor , It's a lot of fun to watch movies, play games, to read and what else to do on a display. <<< Battery >>> The battery is with 2915 mAh, although much smaller than many Phablet competitors, convinces me however in the everyday life to 100%. With moderate to heavy use, I still have 10% - 20% left over at the end of the day, and with light to moderate usage, I can even come up with a single charge for more than two days. <<< Stereo Speakers >>> A speaker is on the bottom as usual , a second sits in the earpiece of the iPhone. They are louder than those of the last generations and produce a more balanced sound with beautiful heights, mids and even some basses. <<< Accessories >>> As with every generation, there are again this year a tremendous amount of accessories such as covers, protective films and all kinds of other things your heart desires, which is an advantage that you only have with the iPhone and no other smartphone in this way. Here are my favorites from this year (as of 31/10/2016): - Leather and silicone shells of Apple Apple MMYJ2ZM / A iPhone 7 Plus Leather Case black - Display film of Dipos 2x dipos Glass bulletproof film iPhone 7 Plus protective plastic glass 9H <<< missing headphone jack >>> I am a shatterer of the future and think it is a good decision from Apple to omit the headphone jack to promote wireless solutions. BUT the included Lightning headphones and the Lightning headphones are just too clunky, but have not found any suitable Bluetooth headphones <<< wide display edges >>> The display edges make the case unnecessarily large and should be smaller in my opinion. <<< Price >> > The price is like every year very high and leaves a big hole in your wallet, at least you get compared to last year for the same price twice as much memory and the support is also a lot better than most other companies in the smartphone market , But it is probably an evil, which one must accept for the many benefits .-------------------------------- ----------- <<< CONCLUSION >>> The iPhone 7 Plus is a very good development of an already very good smartphone and has caught up with this generation a big step on the Android competitors and they in some areas even outdated. The best price performance in my opinion offers the 128 GB model. From me a clear buy recommendation.
7970	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Anonym	4	Expensive, but little renewals	2016-12-09	de	Personally, I like the iPhone 7 plus well. To structure the whole thing, I go to the points design, extras, performance, price and conclusion ein.Das DesignThe design of the new iPhones was already known before the Apple Keynote. Externally, compared to the 6s, little has happened. The antenna strips, which ran across the back, are fortunately now past. Furthermore, the camera was a little modified. It does not look much like a foreign object anymore, as the back covers the lens. Apple has also introduced two new colors and one painted. So there are now gold, rose gold, silver, black and diamond black. The color space gray has been deleted. Last but not least, the new iPhone differs from the old, due to the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jackThe extrasThe new iPhone is touted with a whole range of "great" extras. For one, it is now, finally, IP67 certified, which means limited waterproof (30 minutes at 1m water depth) It also comes in two new colors and the design has been minimally modified. Furthermore, there is no physical homebutton anymore. The new homebutton is a static surface that is moved by a small motor, the Taptic Engine, to create the feeling of pressing a real button. In theory, that sounds pretty good, in practice it could be better. I personally like the new home button. He recognizes my fingerprint as well as the 6s and I can adjust the strength of the feedback. In addition, the loud click at the 6s annoyed me. The problem is that the button ONLY responds to skin contact, so it can not be pressed with gloves. Is a little problem (just press on / off switch) but not quite thought to the end. Argument for the omission of the real button was, by Apple, the waterproofness. For me that's nonsense, my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge was also waterproof, despite the normal button and headphone jack. The new camera is compared to the 6s, much better! It succeed better pictures in dim light, through the new aperture and videos are just a lot smoother, because they no longer blur due to the image stabilization. Compared to the S7 Edge, the images are relatively equal. Samsung tends to overwork the pictures too much. With the iPhone 7, the colors are more natural. Samsung has the faster Autofokus.Ein another "" Extra "" is the missing 3.5mm jack connection. This was much discussed and written. I personally do not care that much. There will be matching earpods and an adapter for the use of existing headphones included. A few magazines write of poorer audio quality when using the adapter. But who calls a smartphone with compressed music and good audio quality in one sentence, is not quite take seriously. A nice feature compared to its predecessor are the stereo speakers.To the well-known speaker at the bottom of the device, now joins another, which is located next to the earpiece and shines forward. Sounds a lot better and louder than its predecessor. A positive development: The memory has been enlarged! Thus, the 16s in the smallest version only 16GB were installed, it is now 32GB. Next it goes with 128GB and 256GB.Ansonsten one must admit that in comparison to the predecessor has not noticeably much improved. The display is a bit brighter and shows colors better, it's a new processor on board and that's it. The performance Yes, the new 7 Series breaks all benchmark records! But no one notices this in normal use! It feels as fast as the 6s. Also compared to my Galaxy S7 Edge, I see, except the operating system, no added value. For me the Galaxy is the most beautiful device but unfortunately with the wrong Software.Man can play everything with the 7 and has plenty of power for the future. However, the technical development is so far that the 6s the next two years will not be maxed out ... There are plenty of videos on YouTube, where Samsung devices are compared with Apple iPhones. In terms of gaming performance, Apple's devices are ahead, but logically, Apple has a very limited choice of devices running the iOS operating system. Adapting software for the few devices is therefore relatively easy. For Android, however, a game must be compatible for devices from 50 € - 900 € with a variety of hardware components. There has a device 1GB of memory and another 6GB. Here is the adaptation of a game much heavier. The PreisJa such an iPhone is not the cheapest smartphone. Currently the cheapest way is via the homepage of Apple itself, where the smallest version starts with 32GB at 759 T € uro. However, this is favorable compared to the previous year, as the storage variants have doubled. It should also not be left unmentioned that Samsung has demanded 699 € and the S7 Edge 799 € for the market launch of the S7. Furthermore, Apple products are subject to a much lower price decline than other electronics manufacturers. Who is the device for? Anyone who already owns an iPhone 6s with 64GB, can skip the 7er confidently. I bought it because I was able to sell my 6s for $ 600, so I could upgrade "relatively cheaply". From the iPhone 6, you notice a difference! It's a solid progression. But I think that it will not be until next year, since the iPhone is 10 years old, really interesting. Who wants to customize his device, install their own software and maybe spend less money, should make a large bow to Apple! Android offers a huge range of different devices in all price categories. Unfortunately, Samsung is now also a so-called premium brand, which is clearly noticeable in the price. The iPhone 7 is for anyone who likes to play on his device, value on a good support and for people who just want it, where everything without big problems should work. Ideally one uses already other Apple devices, since these harmonize with each other super! Of course this does not mean that you should not use an Android device with a Mac, or an iPhone can not connect to the Windows machine. In the end, it is also a matter of taste that everyone has to meet.
7971	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Kai	4	Super Iphone, old diseases	2017-06-23	de	I rate here the Apple Iphone 7 Plus with 128 gb. Since the Iphone 4, I am an Apple smartphone owner and was rather dissatisfied with many generations. With the Iphone 7 Plus, now everything was done right, except for the old problems. It has a persevering battery life, a really nice size and runs the most stable so far. The workmanship and design are, as always, very good and need not be explained further. I am absolutely satisfied and happy every day that way well, no viruses can implant on my IOS architecture. BUT: The big shortcoming since Iphone 6, which is why I had to apply for 3 replacement devices, was the interaction with software and the charging of the smartphone. I had the problem that my Iphone jumped within seconds from 1% to 100% battery condition and of course then repeatedly went out or restarted. The 4th Iphone was free of this error. So a gross error Apple may actually not unterlaufen.FLUSENKILLER: Lightning connection, all right, but I bet EVERYONE knows it: All of a sudden, the Iphone is not charging properly? NO, in most cases, it's just FLUSES that "plugged" the Lightning jack. This lightning is apparently so sensitive that even a lint is enough to charge a decent load without "" loose contact => Silicon protection caps for about 1 € everywhere are everywhere that can solve this annoying problem kann.I do not know if I will stay with the Iphone, because 2 simple but very annoying problems slowly the fun of this Smartphone series take.I hope my review could help you :-)
7972	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Emre Kaya	5	Excellent !	2017-03-30	de	Best iPhone ever, had already different models such as 3g 3gs 5s 6plus but stands out the 7 plus with its camera, performance and the display. Besides, you do not have to worry if it falls into the water
7973	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Kaufen und Verkaufen	5	My first iPhone, I am very satisfied.	2016-10-13	de	I recently got my first iPhone. Since I'm used to bigger smartphones on Android, it has become the 7 Plus, with 5.5 inch Bilddiagonale.Auf the data sheet, I would not go into, but briefly describe my impressions as Umsteiger.- Case: I have that 7 Plus in matte black. From the processing I am thrilled, the aluminum housing looks great and feels worthy. The antenna strips of the predecessors have almost disappeared. As a screen background, I use the unofficial dark fashion, the device is described on various websites. As a result, the iPhone is completely in black, looks chic. The disadvantage of the 7 Plus is in relation to the screen very large frame and the high weight compared to the Android competition. It is similarly slippery in the matte version as the Samsung S7 Edge operating system: Before my device was delivered, I was looking for iOS operation tips. It should be limited to the current iOS 10 or possibly 9, as of course always something changes. There are YouTube videos, web pages and also magazines. Typical processes, like e.g. switching from the photo gallery to the camera is pretty fast. The 7 Plus runs very smoothly with 3Gb memory. For the first time I use the iPhone fingerprint sensor, which I'll use permanently - because it works so fast and reliably , That was a key reason for buying an iPhone. At Sammy, I disabled it at some point. Also, the location of the device can be set up quickly and I do not have to google the best third-party app for it. When surfing with the Androids there were incidents where I did not trust the device properly. Since I am online banking u.a. I prefer to reset it to factory settings. The security apps, I do not trust so much. On the PC (good security software provided) and iPhone I feel better protected. Installed apps ask the iPhone on the first start, if they annoy me with notifications. Homebutton: Since this is my first Apple Smartphone is, I can not compare to the homebutton of the predecessor. I think it's better to have one, so I was a Samsung user before. With the 7 Plus the intensity of the vibration feedback can be adjusted and I work quite relaxed with it. If it is to be more durable than the older models, I like to take it.- Camera: The camera app starts almost as fast as the Samsung competition. I've set the iPhone so that it displays the lock screen on the Uplift, a short swipe from right to left, the camera is ready to go, zack.Entgegen some "tests" I see the quality of the photos in daylight at least on par with the Galaxy S7. Samsung recognizes the colors of the scene and then neatly pops in the color intensity. Apple is more neutral here. Fine details like leaves and branches are not sharpened and are less pixelated on the iPhone.The autofocus is the Galaxy S7 faster sharp.Größter disadvantage with Samsung S7 is the very short range, which is sharply displayed. This is only a few meters, everything before and after is increasingly blurred. When taking pictures of buildings along the street that is not always desirable, in portraits already. Not a photographer, probably has to do with the larger aperture. The Galaxy S6 did not have this so extreme, as well as the iPhone is better here. At low-light, the quality of the iPhone 7 Plus is significantly better than that of Samsung. The color reproduction is much more realistic. Samsung photos often become extremely yellowish, colors of e.g. Plants are intensified too intensely for the lighting conditions. In addition, details on the iPhone do not disappear as quickly in the Pixelmachsch as with Samsung. Images of the iPhone get a little brighter and show more details. The decimal place at the aperture size brings Sammy no advantage here. Photos in raw format are possible. Note: The "zoom lens" is an asset in good lighting conditions and a reason to buy the larger model. In the dark, however, only the wide-angle lens is used and enlarged digitally. So here better refrain from it or snap with / without zoom and compare. The portrait mode with the blur effect should be redone, example images on the net looked very good to me.- Other: Who does not need the camera features, not to use the desktop mode for surfing or iPhone with one hand, possibly drives with the 4, 7 "better. Try it! - The battery is quite strong and is in no way inferior to the Galaxy. The loading times are longer than the Samsung. After the Samsung Note 7 embarrassment, I'm glad too. The S7 Edge, I was already worried when I installed a BS updates while loading. It was always warm, but the appliance was almost cooked. It was not that extreme on the older Samsung models. - Clever how to use Siri. I find it helpful.- Most Google Apps are available, eg: Chrome, Music, Translate and Maps.- My recorded TV series I get from the PC easier on the device, as I first thought. VLC Player App, do not need to convert, copy and sync with iTunes right there in the VLC menu item, only the first time unfamiliar, then it's quite simple. Conclusion: The transition from Android to Apple was quite simple. I'm very happy with the iPhone and I do not feel I have to constantly switch between the Android manufacturers, because one could have reinvented the wheel. The protection against access from the outside and also within the operating system / Apps is now clearly better. iPhones are quite expensive, if it does not have to be the latest, possibly buy used and unlocked predecessor model.

7976	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Ari Alexa	5	Wonderful Smartphone	2016-10-15	de	I got my iphone7plus 128GB just 2 weeks ago and i must say that it's a wonderful smartphone. It's really fast, the battery life is surprisingly very good, the dual camera system is a game changer, specially the portrait mode acts like a professional DSLR Camera, it's also performing real good at the low light. The stereo speaker system is good, which makes me want to watch more movies or TV series on my phone. The new home button is of course different than the older iphones, but I got use to it and i even like it more than the older ones, And yes, i know that it's got no headphone jack but I'm happy with the lightning port. I guess I'm going to buy a pair of Bluetooth earbuds.Oh by the way, iPhone isn't exploding like a Galaxy Note7 ;)These photos are shot using iphone7plus Zoom lens
7977	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Gilles	4	From Iphone 6 Plus to 7 Plus.	2017-02-13	de	Having had almost every iphone so far. At the beginning 3 then 4 and 5 and then the 6 plus. I bought the normal Iphone 7 again after the 6 plus because I found the Iphone 6 plus big. It's hard to decide because of the 2 sizes, If you have the normal then you find it too small and if you turn the big then you say it is too small. I bought the Iphone 7 Plus in the 128 GB version in matt black. From the model it is externally almost identical to the 6 Plus only that there is no headphone connection and that the antenna strips are now better mounted, so that you almost do not see it. I would now not here to go into all the technical details because most users have already written enough. I just want to tell my opinion if it's worth it from 6 plus to 7 plus to change. I think in any case that it's worth it. Alone because of the camera quality. I am someone who often takes pictures and then edited them with an app. I think the camera just great. The shoots so good photos that they are sometimes better than a Dslr.Was I like in any case, really good are the 3 D Touch, I use it very often.Hier times positive and negative points.Positive: Battery (Top ) Camera 3D Touch Matte Black is really very noble and less prone to scratches than the diamond black. Size of the screen. Super if you are surfing the internet a lot or reading newspapers for example. Speakers work much better than those of the old 6 Plus. Negative: Definitely the price. Always the same design. As you see, Samsung is already better in terms of design. As you can see is not much negative. When I look at the Samung Edge 7, for example, looks more modern and the design is better than the Iphone. I had bought the Edge 7 and it after 1 week sold again because I just can not handle Adnroid. Ios this is definitely the better choice. Conclusion: The switch from 6 Plus to 7 Plus is worth it. From the 6 S Plus to 7 Plus, it's definitely not worth it.1 Star deduction I give because the prices of Apple are simply too expensive.
7978	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Doktor Tec	4	Forever Apple	2017-05-25	de	Comparisons with Android smartphones should not be considered for the time being and argue with facts. IOS is a closed operating system and is only withheld from the iPhone so you can adjust the operating system 1: 1 on the hardware and thus achieves the highest performance with stability at the same time. In an iPhone, no 8-core processor with 6GB must be installed and there is actually already the special, even older iPhones get updates after years and are always technically up to date. The iPhone 7 Plus is a very good smartphone but I would with the purchase better waiting there in the autumn the new iPhone generation rauskommt which according to data in the net many new features will have (anniversary).
7979	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	youvie	4	Very nice bone	2016-11-27	de	Had an iPhone 5s and now I switched to the 7 Plus with 32 GB. The main reason to take the Plus model were the two lenses. Meanwhile, the picture quality at least in better light conditions of the my bridge camera zoom. It is super practical to have no camera to tow on holiday, but somehow I had missed the telephoto lens. In the first holiday, the camera had worked very well, great pictures and I was glad from time to time to have the telephoto lens. If you are not on a safari right now, the camera is enough for me. I had also decided on the 32 GB version, because I do not need the complete music collection on the iPhone. If necessary, you can access everything about the cloud. Otherwise, the new model is fun, it is in any way a significant improvement to the 5s Modell.Ein point deduction then for the size. 5.5 instead of 4.7 inches sounds little, but is really a lot. Subjectively, the plus version is much heavier and a bit unwieldy. Although I have to say that this model fits easily in every trouser pocket.
7980	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Argent 	Felle	5	Very high quality with many improvements	2016-09-23	de	In the following report, I would like to pass on my experience with the iPhone 7 Plus. I chose the 32GB version in the color silver. Packaging: The packaging is typical as you know it from Apple. On the front is now the back of the respective In addition, the box is now wrapped in a plastic wrap, which you can raise by means of a tab. Scope of delivery: The scope of supply has changed this year almost nothing. In addition to the power plug, Lightning cable and the Lightning headphones is this time because of Something of a pity I find that the headphones (and the adapter) this time only in a cardboard holder and not as usual in a small Plastikbox.Design: The design has changed in this year, hardly anything most of them we have exactly the same design as the iPhone 6 Plus and 6S Plus. The biggest changes are the antenna strips on the back, which are now embedded in the upper and lower edge. The two black color variants are hardly noticeable, in the silver color version you can see them, but not as clearly as before. The slot of the earpiece was also slightly longer However, I could not exactly check this. The changed design of the camera is also immediately auf.Sowohl the dual camera in the 7 Plus and the normal camera in the iPhone 7 are still outstanding Dimensions of the iPhone 7 are exactly the same as the predecessor. The iPhone 7 Plus is now 4 grams lighter, but this difference is not noticeable. The design is as usual good, but I would now after 3 years again wish a completely new design In any case, it would be good if the screen edges become narrower in the future. Processing: Also this year the iPhone is again top processed. The iPh one is made of aluminum and it is high quality processed. It feels really very good in the hand. Also, the loud / quiet button, the on / off switch and the mute switch are very well processed.It does not wobble at all and the pressure points are also very comfortable. Memory: The iPhone is available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB memory sizes. If you like watching movies offline and often shoot videos, especially in 4K, then you should look at each one Case for a larger memory option decide.Ich even with 32GB memory handle very well, since I leave only apps and pictures permanently stored on the device. When I turn videos, then I always transfer this to the computer to save memory. Here you can each decide for themselves, how much memory for the personal user experience are fitting. Missing jack connection: One of the most discussed and criticized characteristics of the new iPhone is the lack of jack connection. I can understand all which are disappointed about it and criticize the missing connection. In the direct comparison the new included Lightning headphones the same music quality as the EarPods mi All I tested headphones with a jack connection have worked with the included adapter right away. The look of the adapter does not look so appealing, but it works reliably so far. Home button: The home button is also one of the innovations of the iPhone 7 / Plus.Optically, there are no differences, but the new home button can no longer be pressed in. The Taptic Engine generates a vibration due to a small motor, which can be felt when pressed. The intensity of the feedback can be changed in 3 steps. At the beginning maybe it's still a bit unusual, but you get used to it quickly.Me like the new home button better than the old Homebutton.Ein fingerprint sensor is also integrated back into the home button.This works just as fast as its predecessor.Water and StaubErstmals the iPhone is after IP67 water and dust protected. 30 minutes under water at a low e of 1m, the iPhone should now survive unscathed. Display: The display is as well as its predecessor very very good. The resolution is at 1920 x 1080 gleichgeblieben.Der color gamut was increased by 25%, also the brightness was increased by 25%.In addition, the viewing angles are very good. Everything looks a bit better than the iPhone 6S Plus. The 25% higher brightness is only used when the brightness control is set to "Auto" and the iPhone is very bright Pressing on an appsymbol will open a window for various shortcuts. IOS10 has further improved its functionality. Speakers: For the first time, 2 loudspeakers have been installed which should provide stereo quality A speaker is located as usual on the bottom, the second speaker emits the sound through the earpiece. It makes sense in any case, that now two speakers were installed. The sound is now much clearer and it makes much more fun videos to watch and listen to music. Battery: Although the battery is 2676 mAh slightly smaller than that of the iPhone 6S Plus (2700mAh), but thanks to the new processor, it keeps up a bit longer. Who already came through the day well with the iPhone 6S Plus, will have no problems here. Two days are also possible if you use the battery In direct comparison with the iPhone 6S Plus, the battery actually lasts a little longer. For me, the battery life is definitely satisfactory. Performance: The new A10 Fusion processor and 3GB of RAM are used on the iPhone 7 Plus. IOS10 is preinstalled. Everything runs very smoothly. Whether switching between apps, opening apps, zooming, wiping and scrolling, everything runs very smoothly and quickly. Ruckler I could not determine yet. Even very complex games run smoothly. In general, the noticeable difference to the iPhone 6S Plus but not so huge. Camera: The iPhone 7 Plus is a dual camera used. This consists of a Telelinse and a Wide lens. In addition, a double optical zoom möglich.Das switching the zoom level by pressing a button on the Display.Die pictures with the new camera make a very good impression. Both the colors and the contrast are even better than the iPhone 6S Plus Colors are beautiful, of course. Also in low light conditions, the camera makes much better pictures. One can really make first-class shots. The portrait mode is not yet available, but should be submitted later this year by update. This mode is only for the iPhone 7 Plus available. The front camera has now a resolution of 7 megapixels. The quality of selfies is thereby again a little better. Skyping or phoning by facetime also works in very good quality. The video quality is synonymous positive hervorzuheben. 4K recordings are possible again and the optical Image stabilizer is also used again. This makes it very easy to move Whether taking nature shots, videos from and with friends or videos from the family, the camera delivers very good results. Conclusion: Even at Apple, we are experiencing no revolution this year, but a very good improvement in many areas. The new Camera makes excellent pictures and videos, the new home button is also very good. However, the missing jack connection could be a problem for one or the other. Owners of older iPhones can change without hesitation. Owners of an iPhone 6S Plus should think twice about whether the innovations Surcharge worth. You get without a doubt a very high quality processed smartphone which is one of the best devices on the market today.
7981	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Weazle	3	Comparison IOS and Android as well as processing / price unacceptable for this performance-- UPDATE 12/2016	2016-12-02	de	The update is at the bottom of the text! This is my second Apple ... but the first Private. Official had and I still have the iPhone 4, and I really only needed to telephone. With the operating system, I never broke apart. I am a diehard Android .. whether HighEnd Smartphone or just "" only "" middle class. This is my first private iPhone ... I took the step dar. Why? Well, out of curiosity, because many have told me how great The new IOS is what you can do with it and how reliable an iPhone ist.Zum mobile phone itself: The workmanship is flawless, no bumps, dents, edges or wobbling Tasten.Der new 3D home button reacts precisely. Likewise, the finger scanner, this responds immediately without error. The touch screen has brilliant colors and reacts extremely precise and without delays. The Fotocam really makes in any mode brilliant pictures, even the videos are very good. All in all, the system reacts pfei Quickly without jerking. Really impressive. Synchronization via PC with or without cable (WLAN) works flawlessly and the software is of course to use. Also SIRI is very helpful. Even if she is sometimes bitchy and does not answer. But if you feel like it, she is very helpful. So I do not type any more appointments but let Siri do that ... as well as we call contacts, etc. You also do not have the iCloud Use calendar or contacts, for up-and-comers like me from Android (Google) that is practical, that you can still save on Google.Denn my Outlook is synonymous with Goggle tuned and so I need to do nothing there. What bothers me, however, very: One I can go to the directories in the directory, just like a hard drive. I can shovel data at will. I can quickly load and set my own ringtones or wallpapers and I have millions of free and helpful apps. WhatsApp can also meet my needs I can not do it that easy any more! And that gives a star deduction. I have to laboriously convert ringtones into the Apple format to get them via iTunes u only charge with WhatsApp as an example - that only takes the on-board sounds. And these are - with good will - completely dreadful and outdated. What does Apple think so .... Even with apps that is such a thing .. .. Many apps cost money that I get as Android free. And many apps are not there for the IOS. Example AVM MyFritz! AppJa which is available for both systems, but for Android already as version 2 with many new features. At Apple not. AVM WLAN does not exist and the program BoxtoGoPRO (for AVM) does not exist. Brother Printer Software is not synonymous like in Android and I could list for hours. That I find weak. It is so tedious, data, etc.To bring the iPhone - Andoid is much better. The price of this iPhone 7 Plus with 128 GB is well beyond good and evil. It is very thoughtful at Apple that you buy more accessories and not - as with Androids - can be used to compatible mass-produced. It is the Micro USB to charge and sync, the jack for headsets ... For Apple well thought-out for profit - for the user, however, completely wrong. All in all, I summarize: very well processed and really very fine tuning of the system - there is nothing to say.But the price is not justified and ease of use in terms of personalization of the iPhone for the user, Apple is miles away from the android. Basically - just because of the outrageous price and the missing Possibility of easy and free personalization through apps - I give really only 3 stars My last Android was a Huawei X5 - even with fingerprint And there was the fingerprint fast as an arrow, by memory card I had to the onboard 16 GB again 128 GB. The body is there also made of metal. The operation of the screen was almost as accurate .... And if I do now comparisons ... 220 euros to 1000 euros ... because I really wonder what that should.Wenn I already buy such an expensive device, I would like to be so limited as a customer nicht.Nun well, I have it now and I'll have to live with that .... but my next one will be an android again - I prefer that .... But that's my personal attitude. UPDATE 12/2016: So, after I got used to this iPhone to some extent, the following is true , which might be important for Android Umsteiger - as I am also - could be About this you can not send music. I've always liked to send birthday songs about it. I can not do that with IOS. Also, I've been able to click several people from my WhatsApp contacts whom I have send something w ollte.Das is synonymous here - but not so einfach.Die frequently contacted contacts can click directly.Gut I think iMessages ... with other iPhone users, you can send great news, emojis and pictures. But just with those. Do not disturb mode: That's sometimes completely wrong. While I still received Android from my selected contacts in the "Do Not Disturb" mode "phone calls, SMS and WhatsApp, this is not here. Really only phone calls This is for me personally completely wrong. The iPhone plays no AVIs! If I get from my surveillance cam an email with an AVI video, I can not play this. That is completely off sowas. I stay with it - the next will be back Android - definite.No conclusion: If my review helped you further then I would be very happy about a positive feedback.If you disagree, please leave a comment, what I could have done better.Thus help not only me, but all interested parties and readers. Many Thanks.
7982	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Gold	Sommerchen	4	A bit more perfect than its predecessor - unfortunately only little visual change	2016-09-17	de	(Edit from 27.10.2016 because I have the device now for a while and can report in more detail) For years, I am a loyal iPhone user, because I just fell in love with the handling and design of these devices - earlier I had the same smartphone from other manufacturers , with which I was equally satisfied, but at some point I was out of my age, always something new, wanting different, main thing somehow in fashion and envied by friends. For me personally, the iPhone has the right mix of everything and so far I was I am always very satisfied with the material processing, the technical composition and the operating system. Since I am already swiftly switching from the 4.7 "to the plus model in the 6 version, this time I deliberately decided directly for the Plus version with 32 GB. The initial price, however, has increased slightly to 6er - not distinctive, but at least. However, I think it is justified only by the higher memory (instead of 16 GB, 32 GB - the same with the devices with more memory) and thus okay for me. So, what is there to say? Optics: I actually have now the same device, only instead of Generation 6 Plus, 7 Plus. Also the color (gold) stayed with me. Thus, one can almost think that it is still my old device, since visually not much has happened this time. On the back you can see the new device only on the offset antenna strip and the eye-catching double-lens camera, with a telephoto lens and wide-angle lens. As with the predecessor, the camera is einwenig from the case, which has recently been criticized by many, but what Apple obviously did not manage to fix. It does not bother me, because I always have a bumpers drum anyway and thus this 'unevenness' is irrelevant. On the front you can see the visual difference only at second glance - because even if the homebutton is no longer a real button and through Force Touch works, he is still visually a button that is einwenig inserted into the display glass. If you compare the device directly with the predecessor, you can see that the front camera is slightly offset and the 'handset' a little wider. Finally, you can see a difference at the bottom of the device, since the jack is now missing, but installed a second speaker ist.Kamera: It was promised a lot and you're already used by the predecessors a great camera. But time passes and with it the technology. Here, Apple has caught up well again - with the 12 MP dual camera (telephoto lens and wide-angle lens) anyway. If you just want to take a picture, you can still do that. But amateur photographers can now let off steam on the iPhone 7 Plus. It takes time and patience if you want to exhaust and explore everything. After a few minutes you can quickly recognize and see: Great Camera! And not only for photos, but also for the 4k videos. In addition, the camera now triggers even faster and the flash is brighter. More technical details probably know all those interested in Apple. The front camera has also been upgraded a bit, which is clearly in the sharpness of the Bilder.Sound: I had tested the new sound with a few songs - while the phone to me lying in front of me. I thought the sound is a bit better, and was always happy anyway. Not so long ago, I had the smartphone lying right in front of me and playing on an app. When it started, their music also started - and I was totally blown away. If the iPhone 7 Plus is horizontally in front of you, the sound really is absolutely mega and has totally convinced me. More has happened than I expected.Speaker: Now you can enjoy a better quality while talking on the phone. You also notice an improvement here, without the sound was ever bad. But lying with the interlocutor and his device / reception, this change brings nothing of course. Headphones: Since the jack now falls away, you have to decide whether you want to charge the iPhone or connect the headphones, because both are no longer at the same time. Of course, the headphones are also available - if you want to listen to music and enjoy the store at the same time, you have to buy Airpods (which will be available soon) - these are Apple's Bluetooth headphones. In addition, you can still use old headsets or normal headphones, as a Lightning jack adapter included in the delivery.Display: Still top class and now even better. Okay, I have to admit that I can not see any real difference, but hey ... what the hell? Homebutton: This button is not a real button anymore, but it still looks like that and feels the same as the old homebutton in the interface. The difference can be noticed only when pressing, because the button does not yield, but the device only slightly vibrates on successful operation of the button. In addition, the button reacts only to fingers. Fingernails or other things do not help anymore. Work Qualli: The A10 chip and all other necessary technical details have been upgraded and let the iPhone 7 work smoother and faster than its predecessors. However, I found my iPhones never slow, jerky or otherwise negative in the work, therefore ... Liquid and fast as always. Battery: The battery is similar, as the predecessor where there are some negative, sometimes positive changes in various uses. Generally you should be able to call the device for about 21 hours and surf the Internet for 13-15 hours. The standby lifetime of 16 days is more likely ... well ... With 'normal use' (Internet, telephony, WhatsApp, standby, etc.) my iPhone 6 Plus lasted about 48 to 62 hours. The iPhone 7 Plus also manages to do this in a similar way. Water-tight: What many people have not understood with other branded cell phones is that waterproof is not always waterproof. You should not carry your smartphone in the bathing suit in the sea, just like in the past. Also on a pool dive should be waived. You may be able to dip the phone briefly in clear, untreated water, but that's about it. Except for rain actually quite unnecessary for me, because in addition to rain and drink, there is always something in the water. Nice thing, but only rarely to use. The watertightness becomes interesting for me only when you can really take it into the pool. IOS 10: Again, Apple has pulled along again and as always the new software is better than the old one, but it is also so fresh and unfamiliar because she is quite different in some things. I think it's good. In all, a great device with some great improvements to its predecessor. It's a bit more expensive and ... Yes, I liked the design of the 6's very much, but I would have liked a little more visual changes (The last 3 photos were taken with the iPhone 7 Plus)

A call to the Apple service line confirmed that fact, more than that, the warranty expired more than 2 years ago and the device was designed for the US market, making repairs extremely expensive and complicated.

It was quickly a message that the Iphone is no longer functional by a shock. The Iphone has never been dropped or encountered other objects. Now statement stands against statement and an assertion was expressed, which I can not disprove. It could also be that the Iphone already had a shock damage and therefore was sold ...

In addition, the charging of the cell phone does not work properly, also spins the battery and goes quickly empty. The Habdy is often easy and sometimes it has days where charging does not work at all. I contacted the seller two weeks ago and have not received any feedback until today. Very disappointed! Keep away from it.

But the update policy of Samsung and Co. had annoyed me more and more and so I switched to Apple 4/5 years ago and have never looked back since. I currently use an X, my wife a 6S Plus and our daughter a 6s and we are all enthusiastic Apple fans and if Apple maintains its update policy, then it will probably remain so many years!

My conclusion: I think the device is very noble and a real buy recommendation!
8000	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Filipe Ponte	1	Terrible experience	2018-11-06	de	I bought an iPhone 6S 64gb as NEW in August 2018. After 2 months and a half the battery swelled up. I went to an apple certified repair store where they told me the warranty wouldn't cover the case because the Iphone had been activated more than 2 years ago and the screen was not even original apple.

8002	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent 	A. Gentsch	3	the XR alternative	2019-01-13	de	The Iphone on the fast and well packaged by Amazon the next day with me. The phone is not quite up to date, who needs a simple phone for normal use, here is gold right. The purchase price is of course a bit high on Apple level, because you get comparable technology from other manufacturers cheaper, but you are not in the Apple cosmos ... It is a rock solid device, the memory is too low for today time or my use, the Camera does what it should, but not less. The display is at XR level, not good but not bad. The battery lasts realtiv long and is well protected by the current IOS by the battery state option.

When it arrived yesterday (delivery time 1 week), I have not unpacked it, but only have it checked by a friend, if it is actually eon new device and no usedest! It was a nail new. It was immediately unpacked and installed. Of course there were initial difficulties, since this is my first iPhone! It's easy to handle and I wonder why I did not get one before! The sale went smoothly and it was a good decision! Any time ! Where do we hope that the iPhone is still years with me!

According to Apple (Apple Store) is not new, since 2017 for the first time registered with Apple in the US, so the warranty is extinguished. In the context of customer satisfaction, Apple exchanges the phone for a surcharge of 50 € against a new device. I would avoid this seller. The phone itself is top! The behavior of Apple exemplary! the seller is a ......... !!!!!!!!

8009	iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	Peter Schwerdtfeger	1	Big flop !!	2019-01-03	de	I bought two Iphone 6s within two years, and shortly after the 1 year warranty expired, they both gave up. The first after an update of the operating system. The second in an exam by Apple. Actually, only the battery should be changed, since the capacity showed only 85%. Function of the iPhone up to the diagnosis perfectly. So sent in and waited. After careful examination of the Apple technicians a defect of the motherboard was found. Cost of repair 330, - €! That at a time when Apple is no longer allowed to sell Iphone 7 and 8 in Germany and break the sales figures. A rogue who thinks bad things! The theme of Iphone 6s has done for me. Apple's quality was much better in the past. My old Iphone 4 and 5 are still doing their duty.

8084	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Libelle	1	Stay away from this provider.	2018-05-05	de	Sold by J.K.WalteriPhone was described as overhauled, visually and technically flawless. Actually, the iPhone looked visually very good even after delivery. Due to a display break, the device had to be repaired shortly afterwards. Hereby it turned out that a cheap battery was installed. Well, OKSchlimmer is, however, that the seal was completely missing. Furthermore, various screws were loose in the device, a screw was not tightened and slid inside the case back and forth, which would have led to prolonged use quickly to a board damage. My daughter found in the headphones a used chewing gum! All this was in the "general overhaul" ignored, speak it was dilettantisch worked, the main thing is optics.
8085	iPhone 6S	128GB	Argent 	K-D-U	5	Wonderful :-)	2017-05-20	de	Although definitely a non-Apple fan, I have to admit that this iPhone, like the 4th and 5th generation, is also very well made and high quality - lucky in view of the high price, which corresponds to two well-equipped notebooks for Windows. Despite very intensive use of the battery after a year - according to the battery test app Tkozyk - still 86% efficient. I think that's not bad after certain 500 charges. Top is the good, understandable and clearly adjustable system, the fast and secure fingerprint sensor, the small problems in the case of updates, the high security of the system against malware and the huge selection of useful apps. If you use the phone a lot for music, short work processes, navigation (HERE on / offline navigation), logbook, photos, ebooks, news release and various messenger / social platforms, you should definitely invest the money for 128 GB of storage , as a retrofit iPhone is not known to be possible. The only alternative (in my view), the technically good Windows Phone platform, has been completely disqualified by Microsoft's unreliability to buyers who have repeatedly been left standing in the rain with their devices without updates, and I personally only advise Android People who like to grapple with multi-faceted systems, imho's unspeakable espionage, and viruses. I had several times for a short time Android Mobildevices (tablet and mobile phone) and found to my astonishment after years still in my Google account, the website addresses that I had viewed several years before with these, although I had tried on the Devices to set the best possible privacy options. The data could be deleted, but this was awkward - an experience that I remember unpleasant. I mention that, because of such experiences, I am quite willing to pay the high extra price for the iPhone, here you can completely do without Google apps, which I would recommend privacy-joyous benefits.

Have the phone this morning at 5:30 clock disconnected from the mains (fully charged). So far (11:30 am) I have only written a few messages. Background activities are all turned off or deactivated. My battery level is currently at 56% and that after only 6.5 hours (according to battery usage indicator allegedly 2h 6min use and 6h standby). I'll watch the whole thing first but it does not seem normal to me. Not with a new device ...
8088	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	P. Lehmann	2	any time	2017-02-06	de	I use the apple devices since the 3gs generation.

8112	iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	Eduard R.	5	Switch from Android	2016-05-08	de	I decided some time ago to buy a new phone because my old Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 after 4 years but slowly made problems (crashes, battery lasts barely half a day, etc.). Since I no longer play games or generally play around with the phone, it should now be an iPhone. The "" restrictions "" the Android users often complain I do not care, because I use the phone only for writing, surfing, telephoning and working and the iPhone offers more than enough possibilities. So now to the phone: I come with one Battery charge without problems 3 days out, what has surprised me in comparison to the previous cell phone really extreme and above all positive, so ever a first Pluspunkt.Desweiteren iPhone is really extremely fast, in all respects. It's up in 13 seconds, and open all the apps with the press on it, there is virtually no waiting. What I think is cool is the new Taptic engine, so the vibration motor, which works very well, beautiful Vibration Vibrations ... it I would not have cared if the 6S had not had him, but if she is there I will not say no. Now to the main innovations I think very well, makes very good pictures, very true to color and triggers with the pressure directly, again no waiting time , The video functions are also very cool, something like slow motion, time lapse, etc. Recording 4K or in FullHD / HD with 120 / 240FPS is synonymous top.Was, however, for me one of the main arguments for the iPhone 6S was the 3D touch function. I actually use it all the time and it works perfectly too. Especially to quickly call favorite contacts or directly create a new event in the calendar. When writing, I also use the function instead of the magnifier to jump between letters back and forth. The change between Android and iOS was super easy, because of the Move to iOS app, just connect mobile phones and all data, pictures, contacts, etc. are transmitted "I'm very happy with the iPhone, although I'm not an Apple fan. It really works very well, that you have to leave him. I think the price is set much too high, but nowadays, unfortunately, everything costs a lot of money, which is good in terms of quality and functionality.
8113	iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Gray	Amazonarier	5	Simple yet Apple (lighter) ...	2017-01-27	de	What should I write: For Apple fans even hornier. It has a bigger camera (more pixel resolution), is faster, better, bigger ... I agree with my predecessors.

The battery must first are used and after a week I get along very well with him throughout the day and have in the evening still around 50%, with 5 hours of continuous use and 4 hours of standby that is more than okay. To the software you need not say much except It is really great and fast. Camera is top. All in all, everything works as it should and is totally worth the price if you consider paying in the shop over 800 € for it.

After about 1 month of use, no real weaknesses are clear the device runs very smoothly with iOS 10.1 and there was no time for jerks or long load times. The 16GB of memory is sufficient for normal use very well, but who has saved a lot of music on the device is more likely to a 32 / 64GB model The Fingerbadrucksensor works contrary to the expectations very well, it detects in about 95% of the cases the finger on the first attempt what the unlocking of the device significantly accelerates and represents a particularly great benefit for me. The battery holds on average one Day (6-17 clock) with normal use (Internet, music, app use) and usually loads in 1-1.5 hours to 100% auf.Für each one reliable Looking for a smartphone that is easy to use for everyone should think about buying an iPhone.

A friendly customer service representative looked at the device and came to the following result: -Display not original smartphone comes from 2016 and was already registered with Apple "so in use vibration spring not screwed! Four provided screws were missing completely and the spring was loose in the device, which then caused the snarling noise.- Display and housing (splash-splice) was not available! This dealer is absolutely NOT recommended! Hands off!!! This borders on fraud !!!
8147	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Marina Z.	5	Once Apple always Apple	2016-06-12	de	I already had many Apple products (iPod shuffle, iPod touch, iPhone 4, iPhone 5 and iPad mini 2). After a long deliberation, I have now separated from my beloved iPhone 5 after 2 years and ordered the iPhone6S. I'm incredibly happy with this decision. The iPhone is as always great to use. Only the design I do not like as much as the iPhone 5, reminds me too much of Samsung but that's a matter of taste. The 3D Touch is a very funny feature but not vitally necessary. All in all, Apple has outdone itself again. For Apple fans clearly recommended. For newcomers to the beautiful world of apples: do not despair;) iTunes is not that difficult.

8153	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	S_1993	5	Perfect	2016-06-10	de	A dream. Even if I was not an Apple disciple before, I will gradually to this. For all Mac users a great connection. Telephoning and texting, without the phone is next to it. The camera replaced in some cases, the DSLR, of course, not comparable, but in my opinion better than many others, which I was previously experienced. In addition, the battery keeps in moderate use a good two days, which is also better than, for example, the HTC one mini 2. It fits well in the hand and worked fine with me so far. Recommendation on my part is given. Of course, you have to decide if you want to spend the money for it. As always with Apple it is overpriced. I would always advise to 64 GB version, since with 16GB probably most quickly reach their limits.
8154	iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	Amazon Kunde	5	Used - Like New	2017-04-28	de	Everything worked out great. Really only very minor traces of wear on the left side. Otherwise the phone was completely fine.

8158	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	HoKe	5	Still good ...	2017-10-16	de	I would like to get rid of a few sentences for the 6s after over two years of use. For me, the 6s was the best smartphone on the market at that time and is still a good device today. No comparison to Samsung, LG, HTC and Co. The relatively high price is reflected in quality and functionality again and of course you pay for the name. After intensive use, it still looks like new and running smoothly, even with iOS11. You just have to keep the system clean, it does not mean superfluous apps and also make the necessary settings. I did not have a crash or other problems in over two years. Now and then an update or update. This can be an annoying story on Android devices, constantly any updates and hiccups. Pointless apps that can not even be deleted, etc. ... Only the battery gets cold in the cold, but Apple offers a free exchange program for affected devices. I can still recommend the 6s 100%.
8159	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Liane Mocka	1	Images with flash are all overexposed in the dark	2019-01-07	de	For this price (339 €), I have more from the Apple erwatet.Besonders, the night shots with flash are all overexposed and unusable. Even the advisor of Saturn could not help me. It was a bad buy and will not recommend it. It is a cell phone for people who do not take photos at night. And what I did not know, once you paid for the device, you can not give it back.
8160	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	Amazon Kunde	5	Jump over his Android shadow	2016-01-15	de	I also had reservations about iPhone, but I let myself be convinced and do not regret my decision. I'm convinced by the software, in this case iOS9. The nice thing is, it is also useful after years, because Android can not compete. As for the talk about the battery performance, I have my concerns over the test magazines, I think they are sponsored. Mine lasts long enough, 4 days !!! and who is on the phone 24 hours? Less capacity means no shorter runtime, the hardware on the iPhone needs less power.
8161	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	FabiFilou	5	Class Smartphone	2017-06-22	de	I can only say one thing about this smartphone. It's been great for over a year and I'm very satisfied. I've stood a lot and is really fast and 100% worth its price. When the iPhone 7 was introduced, I was really disappointed and am with mine 6s remained with 64gb and regret so far nothing Fingerscan is afloat and the function that turns up the screen is really great. The function that opens when strong press NEN other menu I have not needed until dimming to the flashlight

I immediately put the iPhone into operation. Since I have all the devices from Apple, all my data, addresses and images were automatically exceeded. I am highly satisfied with the handling by Schreiner-Elektronik.
8164	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	linuxi	5	super	2016-05-16	de	So far, I only had Android phones to about 300 euros. Now that my last cellphone had the first technical defects after only 1 1/2 years, I decided to try it with an Apple iPhone. So far I am very satisfied with it. The qualitative differences are clear. Better camera, better sound quality, faster smooth running. The battery life with 2 days is sufficient for me. The design / color in rose gold is great and it fits comfortably in the hand. 64GB of memory are enough for my music, pictures and documentaries. out. Switching from Android to iOS was not difficult and I was able to take my music from GoogleMusik with me comfortably. All apps that I had on my Android phone, work here synonymous error-free. E-mails / messages are picked up as automatically as before. Sure, the price is quite high, but this speaks for the quality and hopefully long life and service life for the phone. Maybe for comparison: you can reach a destination with a small car, mid-range car or luxury class car, the only question is what comfort you would like. They all do driving :-)
8165	iPhone 6S	32GB	Gold	Sandra Jantscher	5	Top smartphone - even in 2019	2019-06-06	de	Top smartphone - even in 2019. Since I find it exaggerated to always have the latest and with an 800 ¬ upwards smartphone around, I have opted for the 6s. By means of power-saving mode, the battery lasts almost 2 days depending on usage and you do not have to do without anything. I would buy it again.

I have to say at this point that I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini and it is my first iPhone. It offers plenty of storage space, has a large display and is also easy to use in one-handed mode If you need a nice, not too big and easy to use smartphone, the iPhone 6s is a very good choice.
8169	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Marie	5	Early status symbol, today as such frowned upon - completely wrong - and pink but unfortunately awesome	2016-03-05	de	Apple always has advanced technology. Live photos alla harry potter have something, yes clearly the phone costs more than the iPhone 6 - but this little thing alone has convinced me. that's what I call lasting memories. The photo and video quality is just amazing and even photos in the dark are very good. and from the optics alone. An extremely slim and lightweight mobile phone. AND NOW that which first made me doubt on the phone - the size. I thought it was unwieldy and therefore harder to use. I was wrong. Recently had my old mobile phone in hand and had to determine how small that actually is - hot service top and you get used to it quickly. Samsung's phones and others often freeze my screen - not here. never . Apple is an example of what also shows optically in Samsung phones. and technically always first. So I have indulged, yes it is easy expensive but I have not looked back and I am convinced that they would not. yolo (sorry i know that the word is embarrassing and out but still it's a good feeling to treat yourself to the best and most expensive cellphone (finally - always had middle class phones before))

Not from the dealer and Apple is going out after a year. Thanks Apple. Should the display now give up the ghost, then I may certainly reach for a repair deep in the bag.
8173	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	MP-BLN	4	Display a bit scratch-sensitive, otherwise completely satisfied	2015-11-22	de	I am very pleased. The iPhone 6s is madly fast and works perfectly. Battery life is more than enough (a charge holds with me 3-4 days). Synchronization with iPad and iMac on iCloud perfectly, as well as with Gmail, Google Calendar etc. Very good sound when listening to music with the included headset. Voice quality when making calls is impeccable. I have yet to get used to Force Touch, so far I have hardly used it. Camera takes very good pictures. The whole device makes in every way a round, mature and absolutely high-quality impression. Only the display seems a bit scratch-sensitive to me. Had despite very careful handling after a few days already two very fine scratches in it, which one sees only with black display and special incidence of light ... should not be in my opinion with a device in the price range yet. There is a star deduction for that.

8188	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	5	Device with battery problem (solved)	2017-01-04	de	In itself, the iPhone 6s is a great smartphone, which I could recommend in every respect. For some time, however, it turns off sporadically when the battery is below 80 (eighty)%. It can then no longer turn on, since the battery is apparently completely empty. It must then be hung on the charging cable, only then the original state of charge is displayed directly again. Increasingly, the problem occurs in a cold environment. Thus, the phone in everyday life is unfortunately almost completely unusable because it works in any way reliably. The problem is well known to Apple, but only a small part of the devices are officially identified and recognized by Apple as problem devices. Unfortunately, a visit to the Genius Bar did not produce any results for me - everything was in perfect order, although my phone went out both on the way to the Apple Store and afterwards and could not be switched on again without connecting it to the charging cable. I really hope that Apple still acts, and also repaired the remaining affected devices. It is in my view an impossibility that a € 800 mobile phone is useless after almost a year. If that really represents the politics of apples, this is probably my first and last iPhone, unfortunately. UPDATE: In a return visit to the Apple Store, the device was replaced immediately and free of charge. Thus, everything is fine with the phone again.

Was very satisfied with the 5s, since I own the 6s, I would not miss it. It is again a significant increase in performance felt when opening of apps etc. Also, I find the camera personally outstanding, so the actual quality. 4K, 12 MP, slomo with 240fps at 720p does not have to mean much, but it does in the case of the iphones! 3D Touch is a nice gimmick, but until now not really often meaningful angegesetzt.Könnte still live photos, etc. report But I do not.

Because, in addition to the many known advantages, it is the first iPhone with enough memory (128 GB) to store photos, videos and music larger scale. Finally, no outsourcing needed. That's worth the extra charge compared to the 64 GB version. The reception problems criticized by another reviewer I could not nachvolziehen until today. All in all contrary to my iPhone 5s, the reception and the voice quality has become noticeably better.

Nervous I find the home button with fingerprint sensor, because this often does not work, especially if you have sweaty hands.

It's my first iPhone and I had thought about adding the 64 GB version before, but I use at most 10 apps, save my pictures and videos always the same on the PC and music I've never heard of my smartphone. I used to have Android and Windows Phone and now I just wanted to give IOS a chance. Compared with the other two systems I noticed.Pro:- much faster "" way of working "" just when opening apps or surfing the Internet- better camera and ingenious display- it is wonderful in the hand and the controls are well arranged- Switch to mute, I think super- large selection of apps (Android is synonymous ok, in Windows Phone, we better not talk about it) - simple and simple in the menu-Tonally, I could actually find no difference, because I put no value on it - better quality accessories => the headset is much better! Conclusion: - the battery needs to be charged more often (Android lasts one day longer, Windows Phone lasts a week longer !! with the same usage) - no removable battery (Windows Phone has this too not) - no SpeichererweiterungDas are as I said no reviews that let me classify the device as less valuable, it is only points that compared to me up fall. The iPhone is my definite favorite because it can do what it needs for me. I will not give it anymore and my next smartphone will definitely be an iPhone again :)

8208	iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	chrisskirsche	5	former Android userin - hello apple	2015-11-18	de	Hello, Foreword: Once I was Applefeindin, until I came to the glorious idea to convert the Samsung S5 to Cyanogenmod 12. (big mistake), constantly this did not work and that not. In short: I wanted to use the hate product of the Android user itself. With great expectation it came and it has been packed pretty high quality. (which one expects of a € 849 expensive device!) The first few hours I was a little awkward, you can tell already on the start screen. The habit of wiping me up each time (usual due to the Samsung S5 usage), but once you register your finger and use it for unlocking, it's even a lot easier than with the Samsung S5 (often even disengaged as it is never wanted to work properly). The 3D feature has now been useful to me only in the email preview. I still play with it and explore the features that the iPhone offers me so. Even transferring the data from Android to iOS was extremely easy, thanks to the Android app, which unfortunately is rated by the Androidhatern more than bad. So I'm wondering what's going on with people? Others buy sinfully expensive Nike shoes and are not immediately pelted with Deichmann shoes. After the second day of use, I'm desperately happy. It does not jerk, it just does what I expect from the device! Instagram makes me even more fun, even if the camera has less megapixels than my Samsung S5. Who cares? This is more than correct for posting and distributing photos and videos. To "" photograph "", I use my Nikon 5300.Everything in one, I do not regret the purchase. The saving was worth it and I get a super device for my own small needs:) Hope it helped
8209	iPhone 6S	128GB	Argent 	Sammler	4	Good device for too high price	2016-01-25	de	This is my first iPhone - to be on the safe side, I got the 128GB version, but in retrospect, the 64GB would probably have been enough. The device feels very high quality, but I expect that at a price of € 959 too! Unfortunately, I obviously caught a Monday device, since it was poorly lit at the top (comparable to a tint on the windshield). Exchange - behold, a similar mistake: the upper left corner was much darker than the rest - again exchange ... the third device now fortunately fits, and on closer inspection, the illumination here is not perfect. This fact I leave in the rating, however, did not flow, since the conversations were not a problem and I obviously bad luck. Big concerns I had first of all concerns the battery performance. Luckily, iPhone "loses" virtually no power in standby mode, but it does so quickly during use. Nevertheless, Apple delivers in terms of battery capacity from a decent performance - a day with rather frequent use should not be a Problem.Begeistert I am from the new "" 3D Touch "" - at first I thought it was a nice gimmick, but it facilitates the operation significantly and thus represents an absolute added value. (Note: perhaps because of illumination problems? - thin design + 3D Touch?) All in all, it is a very good device - but I find the price-performance ratio is not quite appropriate (in particular the price jumps with regard to the storage capacity). But you know that Apple products are not exactly a bargain!

8211	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	TaXi	1	Defective battery! Apple finally offers exchange program	2017-01-07	de	First: I am actually a peaceful-friendly Apple Iphone user since the Iphone 4. Only since the 6s started the trouble. Somehow there is now the worm in it and the whole Apple experience came to a halt, also thanks to lack of Inovation. Right annoying is the battery error: My 6s turns off in a light cold immediately (whether walking, running / jogging, photos at the customer to attempt). I asked the telephone support for clarification months ago and they have actually admitted that there are massive problems (allegedly because of incorrect programming) but my battery would be - according to remote maintenance - in order. Then I was in Centro Oberhausen over Christmas and I'm there in the Apple Store. Behold! There is now an exchange program (found on the apple page and support and then at the bottom "" 6s turns off "" Check here if your phone is affected - Yes of course it was das.Ich could leave the Iphone there and then pick up in 4 days ... erhh yes tips idea.Since I live not in the Centro Oberhausen I have called a Gravis Store in my city. Currently, so many phones are affected (so here can not be the case of individual cases!) that I have to wait three weeks for the new battery, because Apple does not exchange or send out new batteries - NO - first my phone has to be sent in and then there is the new battery - well, what am I doing with my customers in the meantime? Or no matter what, do private individuals who would like to have a cell phone in time? Why Apple offers nothing for (replacement of the cell phone - you should repair it and then resell or take back the scrap and give us a new one). I think it's not ok anyway a cell phone which 800, - EUR now costs to open and reinsert the battery in a service building. This has m.M.n. then nothing more to do with the quality directly from the factory and is still a real Entwertung.Also be careful at 6s - I would not buy it anymore. Make your own picture and google for the battery problem that is very common.
8212	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Jenny	4	Great, but I'm missing something new	2015-11-10	de	I've had every iPhone since the iPhone 3 and have always been very happy with the iPhone 6s. What I miss is a groundbreaking novelty. Apart from the 3D Touch, there is nothing noteworthy. And so far, I have not had a situation in which I could use the 3D Touch meaningful. In summary, I would say that it is really a great phone, which is fully recommended, but who has an iPhone 6, should save money. My (admittedly high) claims were not met.
8213	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Steve	5	As usual Top of Apple!	2016-02-26	de	What should you write long detailed reviews. Most of it has already been said. Since 2010 I always own an Iphone. Have in between the Firephone, for example. tested, Samsung and Huawei. In the end, I always landed at Apple ^ ^. It is simply the best match with the operating system. You pay a lot, that's true, but in principle for that reason. Time from Sciht of a non-experts, I summarize the things that I noticed in comparison to its predecessors positive (there is nothing negative). The Battery: Yes, it is really the battery talk. Correctly read. He was badly rated in tests, also justified. The problem is that 60 percent of users NEVER use the iphone at the level of the test. There it ran with some only 4 hours with full screen brightness and 4 hours of videos. Logically, after 4 hours Sense! The average user like me, writes, chats, reads on the Internet, looks at the train app, has vlt. a candy crush game or something like that: D. And surprisingly, I come with it, compared to its predecessors, one day until evening :) Unbelievable, but true. The screen: Yes, I think 4.7 inches are optimal. Not too big, not too small. The resolution is accordingly nicely matched to the screen and razor-sharp. Newer devices are already aimed at quad hd, but our eye can actually distinguish it from a certain strength, hardly more. So does not have to be quad hd:) The Cam: Yes the camera, since I was always fascinated by. She got even better and even sharper. At the front with 5 mp and at the back with 12. Still for me the best camera for the most beautiful photos, but this time the quality of my skin is already gone. The Akualität: As in the near future more and more 4k will be asked, one can say that This device will be up to date even in 3-4 years. Photos as well as videos eg. can be shot and shot here in 4k (barely applicable but up to date). It is quite future-proof and with the price invested one still better tick, than in the iphone 6. ^^
8214	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	dusttrix	5	iPhone 6s	2016-08-27	de	After the charging socket of my iPhone 6 had the service acknowledged, I got as a replacement device brand new iPhones 6s received. But unfortunately in the color rosé gold, which has run rather stupid for me as a man ... Battery: Lasts felt minimal shorter than its predecessor. According to the data sheet, the battery should also have shrunk, but in everyday life is not really felt. The battery will definitely last longer than a day. With economical use even two. Display: The display is like the iPhone 6 used the madness. Razor sharp, and easy to use. It is more than sufficiently bright. Once used to 3D Touch, it is almost impossible to think away from everyday life. Reception: Always good and everywhere LTE. Also in the WLAN, there is nothing to beansanden.Gehäuse: Except for the color .... the same case, like the iPhone 6. It is (who would have thought) as well in the hand as the iPhone 6 and is comfortable for me Cameras: Both the front and the main camera are significantly better than those of the iPhone 6. And the iPhone 6 was already top more there is not to say.iOS: An innovation is that "" Hey Siri! "" Now also works, if one does not have the iPhone on the charging cable. Otherwise the already mentioned 3D Touch is a new feature. Conclusion: The iPhone 6s is a really good smartphone. It is much better than the iPhone 6, which I did not think before. 3D Touch is like I think a very useful extension and (still) a unique feature. Because of the color, I'll probably have to order a skin slide. But I can cope and forgive full 5 stars.
8215	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Marcel H.	4	Very good smartphone, but unfortunately not perfect!	2015-12-28	de	I would like to start by saying that this is my first iPhone. Previously, I had various devices from the Samsung Galaxy series. My most recent device from Samsung was the Samsung Galaxy S5 Android smartphone, which was also very satisfying. The S5 has already grown old and a new smartphone should come from. The iPhone 6s was the latest in the smartphone market at the time and that's why I decided to get this one. I bought it but not at Amazon but at E-Bay but that is incidental. One day it was so far as DHL arrived with the package. The packaging looks like other manufacturers also very simple and not particularly, but it is indeed more about the content. The iPhone looks really chic. Although it is packed in a plastic coat in the beginning, it makes a valuable impression. In addition, there are also a charging cable with USB Lightning cable and simple headphones as nothing really breathtaking. But now to the device itself: optics / feel: The iPhone looks decidedly valent and you can see no disturbing gaps or other blemishes. The materials are nothing new but they do not look old or boring either. Due to the better and stronger case, the iPhone is a bit heavier which I personally find good because it feels so good and it is great in the hand. Generally, the iPhone is great in the hand and does not feel nearly cheap or fragile. That bothered me a bit on the S5, because here you were afraid if you grab the smartphone a bit harder it would fall apart. The iPhone is now no longer a problem and also bent it has not yet. Hardware: As for the hardware, the S5 can easily keep up and is even partially better. CPU is a dual-core chip with 1.85 GHz of the A9, whether I have now installed the A9 from Samsung or the A9 from TSMC I do not know.RAM's even 2GB which is relatively much even the same as the S5.GPU should bring 90% more power than the previous version. All in all, one can say does not sound great for an Android user. Software: The current version of iOS 9.2 runs very smoothly and is easy to understand and thus the iPhone can be very well served. iOS is not overloaded and seems very tidy. Unfortunately, I must say that there are a few bugs that should not happen in a company like Apple selling the premium goods.After all, I do not want to feel like a test person who is currently holding the beta version in my hands. Unfortunately, I also discovered that it sometimes came to hangers, which of course does not necessarily have to be on iOS rather untypical. But of course, the negative holds within limits and the positive predominates.Performance: With the good software from Apple, the unspectacular hardware gets the best out of it and thus everything goes fast surfing the Internet is very fast. Apps open almost without waiting and multitasking works very well thanks to the 2 GB of RAM. By the way, games run very smoothly and much smoother than with the Samsung Galaxy S6, but this is probably also on the display because the iPhone must be controlled significantly fewer pixels werden.Allerdings but also bothers one here, the Spotify app takes hours to load only when the App the third time starts the Spotify logo disappears and you can start listening to music. This problem can of course be synonymous with the app, but the current version of Spotify runs on the S5 and S6 without any problems and without waiting times. Display: The display seems almost cute with its 4.7 inches, but it is for an iPhone Display is still large and just enough. The display is very good, colors are reproduced very well, the contrast is also top and the angle stability is a lot better than the AMOLED display of the S5 or S6. Now, however, comes the bad on the display, the resolution is a joke 750p? why? For the price Apple should obstruct at least a FullHD display as is the case with the 6S Plus. Samsung QHD display of the S6 is in terms of sharpness just can not be beat and you can tell the difference clearly. I think 4K displays unnecessarily in a smartphone but FullHD must be given! Therefore no perfect display just a very good.Touch-ID: The sensor works really well or it works now even faster tap is enough and you're in it. This works really great and faster than the competition Samsung's sensor is not so extremely fast.3D Touch: Nice new feature is just a little gimmick that you can use from time to time when a boring. But there not even all apps support 3D touch, the function is still not fully usable anyway. Camera: The camera of the iPhone is certainly very good, however, compared with the S6, the images are pixelated and out of focus and synonymous with the panoramic function is clearly S6 implemented better. The 4K recordings are quite good on both devices, but the S6 wins again, because the image stabilizer is much better. Thus, the picture is quieter and sharper. Battery: The battery with the iPhone is not just a runner. It is just about the day when the S5 you can easily get along with a load 2 days. The S6, however, the battery life is not better, the battery is just getting smaller so that the devices can be thinner, makes sense? In my opinion, not really. Conclusion: A very good smartphone with some strengths and cool features, but also with some minor weaknesses which one should be aware. Maybe Apple manages to launch a perfect smartphone with the iPhone 7 with the iPhone 6S, Apple did not succeed!
8216	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Samuel Marton	5	Just for recommending	2016-01-30	de	I switched from Android to the Iphone 6s or ios and I have to say I have not regretted this step in any way. The iphone 6s has a very classy aluminum unibody housing which looks very good in my view. The antenna strips do not bother me at all, I even refer to them as beautiful. the iphone is also very good in the hand. To the display, I have to say that at the beginning, when I heard that the Iphone was not disappointed with a full hd resolution, that really does not falter at all unless you really look closely at the display .... The operating system is on Ios 9 and as a former Android user I have to say that ios is already better .... It just looks extremely plain and not too colorful ..... Although many people have complained about the battery I can give it a touch you can easily through the day and if you have to recharge the battery overnight it does not itch because you anyway sleeps ... The camera is the best smartphone camera I've ever seen ... Pictures are sharp Sharp and really see always very good .... I can really recommend the iphone to anyone .. Only from the 16gb variant I can advise against because the camera really absorbs the memory but the 64gb version is never empty.
8217	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	S. Monster	4	High-quality smartphone with top workmanship but at a very high price	2016-03-08	de	Good: processing, software, camera, app offer, smooth operationGar not good: memory not expandable, no Full HD display, camera stands out easily, "" Price ""; -Deffernt one the protective film of the iPhone one notices immediately that Apple on metal housing sets. The material looks very high quality and feels in the hand accordingly. There is nothing wrong with the processing. The front with the display seamlessly sets up without any disruptive edges where the case ends. The side buttons, the home button and the connections for the headphones and the charging cable are also well incorporated, sit firmly and provide a very good pressure point. Although the camera is also outstanding incorporated, but it stands out a little from the case. When you place it on a table, the iPhone is thus not completely flat and shakes in the operation. First, the SIM card is inserted with the associated tool. When starting the device you will be guided in some steps by menu through the initial setup. A few minutes later, the iPhone is ready for use. The software is designed intuitively, whereby the operation opens up quite quickly, almost immediately. Pre-installed are numerous apps from Apple. These can be if they are not needed or wanted to be uninstalled for the most part, but which is the case with other manufacturers as well and must therefore be denounced equally by all manufacturers and not just Apple. The battery is used relatively often in the relatively fast Knee. Charging takes about as long (or as short) as for devices from other manufacturers. Unfortunately, the battery is unfortunately not interchangeable. However, there are accessories with a built-in additional battery. The display is just a Retina HD display. Unfortunately, this does not solve with Full HD, which without direct comparison, however, neither spectacularly noticeable nor disturbs. All in all, the display is satisfactory. The quality of the recordings is very good. The flash works as it should. Video recordings are possible in 4K, but this takes up a lot of memory due to the file size. So it is advisable to do without it if possible, except you can immediately copy the material to another device. The front camera is still satisfactory in terms of quality. Here, a kind flash can be used by the display (the display lights up very bright white), but there is not necessarily significant differences, unless you are photographing something in almost total darkness. The speakers are quite okay so far. The sound is overall satisfactory. The included Apple EarPods but I would advise to exchange with better sound sources - but everyone likes how you personally like it better. The network reception is good everywhere, even better than with other devices. The connection is made quickly and the call quality is very good. Just like the network, the Internet works well. Especially the WLAN connection is convincing and is much better than many other smartphones. Surfing and operating apps is of course more fun with relatively short load times. GPS works fast and accurate.The same applies to a stable Bluetooth connection and transmission. Apple offers the iPhone 6S in 3 memory sizes. At 16GB you should quickly reach the capacity limit. The memory is unfortunately not expandable, which is more or less forced to buy a device with a larger memory when the capacity limit is reached. Therefore, I would like to recommend 64GB, these should be sufficient for a while in normal use. Special Features: Siri has been on iPhones for a while. Siri is ready to use and delivers good results. The recognition rate is pleasingly high, so that the voice assistant usually understands what he wants the first time and does it immediately (if enabled, Siri listens immediately, without the need for a start, then it can be done without the iPhone Take, for example, set an alarm clock or timer, announce the weather for tomorrow or pass the current football results, which is useful, for example, when driving a car). Also, the fingerprint sensor is not only since the iPhone 6S. This was improved again and works very well and fast. A short hang up is enough to unlock the iPhone (some apps use this feature). 3D Touch is an innovation. The display recognizes how tight you are and reacts accordingly. Pressing strongly opens a menu on some apps that can then be used to directly access certain features (such as writing an e-mail immediately, without having to go into the app). Also, e.g. when pressing firmly on links a preview of the desired website will be loaded. Live Photo takes a picture 1.5 seconds before and after being triggered. This can be animate when you press on a picture. Apple has some special features that are all very well integrated and can also be very useful. Each individual can be activated or deactivated, so you are not forced to use them. For example, if you have a problem with Siri always running in the background, you can disable this option and use Siri in the usual way. Conclusion If you compare price and performance, I find the price a bit high. For this one receives however a TOP processed and high-quality Smartphone. There are almost no criticisms, and those that exist must be blamed on many other manufacturers as well. Only the lack of memory expansion and the protruding camera are particularly noteworthy and also that the display does not offer Full HD resolution. That would be more than adequate at such a high price. Apart from that, but it makes quite a lot of fun, with the iPhone around fantigen.Wegen the missing full-HD and the mentioned negligence, but I have to deduct a star, because all this would be at this high price or simply not there But you have to seriously ask the question whether the designer might have thought of anything, or whether he was only sleeping at the time, while the apprentices are busy went unchecked to the work after the motto: "" Oh easy, will not notice "").
8218	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	nichtl	5	Is the switch from iPhone 6 to iPhone 6s worthwhile?	2016-01-10	de	I've bought every generation of iPhone since the iPhone 3GS (costing around $ 150 a year if you buy / sell it at the right time). The advantages of an iPhone (very reliable, simple operation, extremely good workmanship, great synchronization with OS X) I would not like to mention here again, for the reason most people know this already and I have them in the reviews on the previous iPhone models already I would like to discuss here briefly, whether the conversion of a still very good iPhone 6 on an iPhone 6s is worthwhile and the not so obvious difference herausstellen.1. QualityIn this I was not satisfied with the iPhone 6. It somehow felt "cheap", condemned, was not stiff, everywhere it gave way. Switching directly to an iPhone 6s, you realize that it is much more stable. You do not see that it is a little thicker, but it feels it immediately (I think). It does not creak any more, moreover it is a bit heavier. I like, it finally feels as solid as the other iPhones.2. New featuresHere I can only call 3D touch as the only one. All others (faster Wi-Fi, etc.) I consider negligible, because it was already hoppladihopp on the iPhone 6. 3D Touch is a feature which, typical for Apple, is already deeply integrated into the system. You quickly get used to the resulting shortcuts, it works perfectly well. I can not think about many well-thought-out features anymore (for example, the keyboard turns into a "touchpad" at fixed pressure, which can move the cursor as you type) .3. Speed ​​Can not really say that it has changed. Whether the apps start 0.1s faster, is not really relevant for me in everyday life. More RAMEtwas, which is really helpful! The open apps are now partially in the cache for days and are immediately available when called. This clearly differentiates the 6s from the 6 and is also really useful.5. AkkuI think it's not so nice that the battery is smaller, but I have not really noticed any of it. The duration between the charges is still outstanding - you do not need any trickery or eternal system maintenance. I've made "Backgrund App Refresh" for everything but Whatsapp (no other app really needs it), which adds another few hours. In moderate use, the iPhone easily through 2 days durch.Nach as ugly: The only criticisms remain for this iPhone. That the camera stands out, is very annoying. Constantly tilts the device. Similarly, the plastic antennas are a design flaw. Personally, even more RAM (3 or 4 GB, why not ?!) would not be bad at all. But that's no reason not to buy it. Conclusion: Yes, I think it's worth switching to the 6s. The better quality, 3D touch and especially the RAM are things that you appreciate in everyday use!
8219	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	Thomas	5	Excellent smartphone! Review of a Galaxy S4 / S6 changer	2015-10-21	de	Hi, I have after the S4 / S6 iPhone 6S in 64 GB increased and thus leave the Android OS for the time being. The iPhone I did not buy at Amazon (1019 ¬) but at Media Markt (849 ¬). Impression after a Week iPhone 6S use. The iPhone feels like a one-stop shop. Great look, great processing. The battery holds and holds. Even if the battery has become smaller, it lasts longer than most Android with the thick Akkus.Morgens at 8 o'clock at 100%, with some phone calls, check e-mail more often, online banking I'm at 18 o'clock at 73%. Standby time is terrific like the macbooks. Barely loses% over the night. Runs very smoothly, fingerprint very fast, high data security (rights of the apps can be easily limited). More impressions after 2 weeks The battery continues to keep excellent by s.o. even with Powerusing I am at over 60% on a working day of 10h. Constant phone calls, use notes, send e-mail, Internet research, news apps. The synchronization is of course made great no matter where I write what (notes / calendar) Mac or iCloud it lands on the iPhone and vice versa. The camera is also great. Pictures are similar to the S6 Edge pictures. Here, the ghosts divide between camera Phanatikern.Force Touch is nice but I personally use little. The display is crisp and very bright and very pleasant colors. The OS is of course strongly based on OSX and MacUser should find themselves very quickly cope anyway .Siri has been developed significantly and now understands very well. Dates, alarms, reminders, photos, phone calls, navigations are no problem for Siri. Even something like "" Siri I have a cold or I'm sick "" Siri understands and suggests doctors in your area. Great thing.Clear purchase recommendation.
8220	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Amazon-Kunde	5	Top cell phone for a lot of money	2016-11-27	de	I used the iphone 4s for 4-5 years and then opted for the 6s as it was cheaper than the 7 and in my opinion not much worse. The first few days were a bit strange due to the size but you get used to it quickly. What bothered me a lot is that it has slipped so often out of my hand. I then bought a silicone sleeve. That helped, but of course it does not look that great anymore. If you own an iphone 6 or 6 plus and are considering buying a new one, I can only say, "it's not worth it". Spending so much money for not much more power is blatant in my eyes. An upgrade is in my opinion until the 5s and down to consider. Who says anyway, "" hey I need a new phone "" I can only recommend the 6s. Except for the mentioned smooth surface, I have nothing on the device suspend.I hope I could help a bit.
8221	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	5	Nadini 42	2015-12-06	de	I bought an iPhone 6s at the end of November. The delivery came after three days, super fast and packed very well. That was great. The phone is great. The battery is running and running. I have read the reviews on the supplier first, they were all great and can only confirm.
8222	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Sascha E.	5	Excited	2015-12-06	de	There are 5 stars for the delivery because it came a week earlier than actually stated. The iphone 6s has not had a better smartphone yet.
8223	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	4	Unrivaled good	2016-09-07	de	Who knows how in 2016 a smartphone in the overall concept must 'feel', also knows that you can not get past the Iphone. Overall concept is to feel, processing, performance and above all (!) One: The Software.You can buy the most expensive Aston Martin - without harmony of driver (software) and car (hardware) everything else does not matter.So synonymous with a smartphone. I've been there since the iPhone 5S (formerly a 3G, but iOS was still a complete catastrophe - then long Android - S3 / S4, LgG2, Nexus5) and would like to share my opinion and show why IMO is not Alternative is Excellent. But that's just what you expect from today's smartphones. Especially when made of metal.Haptic: Half star deduction. The 5S is still very good in the hand. The 6S is due to the large screen edge and because of the top and bottom of the large housing part, which stretches the device a bit unnecessarily not always perfect with one hand to operate. For a e.g. Woman with smaller hands I see there black. Other devices are the same here despite more inches (narrower edge of the screen) Battery: Again half a star deduction and also the point of definitely the most disturbing. At least with intensive use. I'll say it this way: I'm just about the day - but it also play one or the other times a Game.Software: iOS itself still has potential. You do not need to say anything about doubly bugs. That has every OS. I'm not so picky. That's what I'm about for touchscreen feedback; and here the Iphone continues to be absolutely unrivaled. Letters react "directly" and the screen stays immediately and without delay under the thumb. e.g. Images in gallery or websites in Safari. Who does not notice any difference to Samsung and Co. - do not know ... for me one of the reasons to stay with the Iphone. There are also FAR higher-quality apps and a tidy Appstore. When I look around the Playstore, it scares me. Contaminated apps everywhere. Especially as a hobby photographer is the iPhone - in terms of apps - actually mandatory. Memory With 16GB you have it. With 64GB you can use it correctly. With Spotify, 2-3 4k videos, some apps and games mostly almost 10GB frei.Fehlender memory card slot? Only useful as an extension of the internal memory, if the card is seen as internal memory (ie like a partition). However, this would slow the memory immensely -> cut me off. Accessories: Lightning is simply the best charging cable! (no matter how rum). I have never used Earpods. Can not possibly be better than reasonable InEars. However, I have never had any claims to enclosed headphones. Conclusion: Of course, the iPhone is not for every purse. Especially since you can pay for more memory again 100 € more. The prices of the competition, however, show that the Iphone is no longer the only capitalist. But I rather pay € 799 for uncompromising fast performance, qualitative apps in a simple, intuitive and secure OS without unnecessary innumerable features (S-view, SmartStay and what not all). But then you have Facetime & Imessage and very long support :-) LG
8224	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Marcel Popp	5	Incomprehensible reviews	2016-09-21	de	I can not hear it anymore! The processor is too slow or the thing has only 2GB of RAM! iOS does not need 6GB RAM or an Octacore! And the build quality that some criticize - since you're sure that you have a real iPhone 6s and not just a cheap fake from China? Have all the equipment here! LG G5, Galaxy S7, Huawei P9 and HTC 10. The iPhone beats them and Android affects me even in the version 7.0 unfinished and still in the beta stage! Top SmartphoneTop processing Top PerformanceMy Galaxy S7, however, is real Chinaware!
8225	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	MR	5	The best and fastest iphone ever	2015-09-25	de	I have the new Iphone 6s in connection with my contract renewal at Vodafone on 25.9. purchased. My model is the 64 Gb variant. There is still a 16 Gb variant and a 128 Gb variant for sale. Previously I had an Iphone 6 and before that an Android from Samsung. I ordered the phone because I was satisfied with my Iphone 6 except for the battery and I could choose a new phone on my contract. In the following lines I try as well as possible to respond to the phone. I will update my recession again and again if there is something new. I also like to answer any questions or try to answer them. ### Optics and Haptics ### At first glance, the new Apple flagship looks very similar to the Iphone 6. The Iphone 6s is made of a new aluminum alloy, a 7000 Al alloy. This alloy makes the iPhone harder and much warmer than the iPhone 6. You just learn from mistakes and gearing up against a new Bendgate as was the case with the Iphone 6 and the Sony Z3. Compared to its predecessor, the smartphone is marginally heavier (14g) and now weighs 143g. Personally, I did not notice the weight difference. In addition, the 6s has become due to the new touch screen synonymous 0.2 mm thick, but I do not feel as bad. The previous colors Space Gray, Silver and Gold are now accompanied by rose gold as a further variant. ### Display ### The 4.7 inch display of the iPhone 6 will continue to be used. It dissolves with 1334x750 pixels, which corresponds to a still very good pixel density of 326 ppi. Hand on heart dear friends, 326 ppi are more than adequate. What Sony or LG throw their new phones in terms of pixel density on the market is spun. You can confidently say that there are no single pixels to see. Apart from the 3D Touch, the display of the Iphone 6s is unchanged compared to the predecessor. But exactly this 3D touch technology upgrades the display neatly. Thanks to the various pressure points, you can save a lot of time using the smartphone when you are used to the operation, but this is quite fast. ### Processor ### The new Iphone 6s works with a new A9 64- Bit SoC processor. According to Apple, the chip should bring a plus of 70% in CPU and a plus of 90% in GPU performance compared to the A8 chip. The A9 processor brings in Geekbench 3 a record around the 2500 points, my Iphone 6 creates compared to the 1600 points. The Z3 of my sister comes only to about 1300 points. The processor of the new flagship is extremely fast, much faster than the fastest Qualcomm processor of the Snapdragon 810. Thus, the new processor is undoubtedly the reference in the field of mobile processors. Hand on the heart dear friends more computing power is currently not available even with the android competition. The device runs without jerks with a top performance. Here you can see that the software is perfectly matched to the hardware. ### Camera ### Less convinced me the new camera. Although the number of megapixels has been increased from 8 to 12 megapixels, the images are not noticeably better, if only marginally. This does not mean that the camera shoots bad pictures.Only the improvement from the Iphone 6 to the 6s is low. Nevertheless, it must be said that the Z3 from Sony, the S6 from Samsung or even the G4 from LG makes better pictures in almost every situation. I do not just want to complain, the front camera has been raised from 1.2 megapixels to 5 megapixels. This innovation leads to noticeably sharper, more detailed images with less image noise. New compared to its predecessor is the 4K video recording, which undoubtedly delivers videos in top quality. However, some Android cars have been able to do this for quite some time. So it was time for Apple to follow suit. However, it should be noted that videos with this resolution generate a lot of data and you have completely filled the 16 Gb memory of the smallest version within a few minutes. We are talking about 350 megabytes of footage per minute. Definitely worth the 64 Gb version or even the 128 Gb version for the people who want to use this feature extensively and more often. Unfortunately, the camera also looks slightly out of the case at the 6s. ### Battery ### The built-in battery is a 1715 mAh battery, which admittedly a bit disappointed. Even the battery of Iphone 6 was already about 100 mAh larger, compared to the android competition, the battery appears very small. The runtime is not very high, the phone does not last more than a day, with frequent use of the battery is already premature to neige.Update 29.9.15To voice quality, I can not report anything negative. When calling in the D2 network no background noise occurs I had no disconnections. The sound of the speakers is also good, and I find that the Sony Z3 and the HTC smartphones offer better speakers and sound quality. However, this is complain at a high level Update 1.10.15The battery is now a bit more persistent than initially assumed. He still can not get to a 3000 mah battery of the Android competition, but the available capacity is very well exploited. 1 day runtime does not seem to be a problem, but in the evening the mobile phone has to be charged. ### Conclusion ### Compared to the predecessor of the iPhone 6, the 6s are more technical, the design remains almost unchanged. But that does not bother, since the Iphone 6 was already a real eye-catcher. The processor is a bit faster and is now the reference class in the field of mobile processors. I like the 3D touch technology very well and definitely offers added value. The Iphone 6s is a successful smartphone. A switch from the Iphone 6 to the 6s is not worth it in my opinion. The added power of the processor and the rest of the innovations are not to be despised, but do not justify a new acquisition. But if you have an older IOS device or an older Android, it's definitely worth buying. Here you do not do anything wrong. Only the weak battery and the camera spoil the very positive picture a little bit. You could have expected more here. I would give 4.5 stars, but since this is not possible I give 5 stars. If you have any questions about the product, you can ask me in the comments, I will then try to answer in a timely manner.
8226	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	Nima H.	5	The best smartphone on the market without ifs and buts !!	2015-10-30	de	This is my next iPhone now ... I have had every iPhone 3G. In the meantime, I also had the Samsung Note 3 and the Sony Xperia Z1 & Z2. Although many here are referred to as "" Apple Fanboy "" because they write good reviews I am DEFINITIVE None! Now, however, to the Apple iPhone 6S 64GB Gold It has not changed ... it still looks just like last year, so that iPhone 6. It has become a good deal heavier, since it is now built from the so-called 7000 aluminum. I think it's not annoying on the contrary you now have the feeling of something high-quality to hold in your hand but that is a matter of taste. Incidentally, there are now 4 colors to choose from, I personally think the golden model is the most beautiful. Real ne eye candy. Software & Performance: The software I think you do not need much to say because someone considering an iPhone to buy knows that it runs on iOS ... and here everyone can say what he wants it is and runs MUCH BETTER than Android in terms of performance, Samsung and Co. can use 16 GB of RAM that does not change anything, even if I hear full HD display, quad-core CPU, etc. What does that bring somebody if everything really everything on iPhone faster, more fluid and easier runs?! One can select now how one wants to take videos eg. Full HD with 30 or 60 or 4K. I record everything in FullHd at 60 and the quality is really awesome !!! Also, the display is extremely sharp ... I wonder how that can be although it is not even FullHD?! People who only look at data and therefore immediately say iphone's scrap (99% of Android users) does me a favor and go to MediaMarkt or Saturn and make yourself a picture of. I bet you'll think how can this be, it's not even FullHD but it looks better than on my smartphone. Even selfies become super good thanks to the 5MP front camera! Or the start of apps ... because you can feel the 2GB RAM ... everything is super fast incredibly. Force Touch is also a win that is guaranteed to be enforced on some apps and are already there eg Instagram, Facebook or Whatsapp.Man has almost everywhere a "" preview mode "" or quick functions. When I think back to my Android smartphones, I can say quite frankly ... I will never switch back because that's worlds for me in terms of performance and operation. It is also not without reason that eg the Samsung S5, S6 (also Edge) flopped ... Sony writes are beginning of the smartphones throughout red numbers. It is changing more and more to iOS, especially in 2015, it was more than ever before (can google is the truth). Clearly, the price is a deterrent but in a course you get usually always good money. Look at what a 5S still costs today ... unfassbar.Ich can definitely recommend the smartphone only weiter.Punkte: - 16GB version is an impudence - Water & dust protected would be great feature - Slightly changed design would be cool
8227	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	ARUK	5	Best overall package	2015-10-12	de	Compared to the 6er a typical s update. 3D Touch is a very handy thing, really good if most apps support it. The camera is again a bit closer to the very good. And that I mean as a user of a Fuji xt1.Fingerprint scanner is perfect.And the speed increase really clear. There is the advantage that Apple developed the processor itself, from the outside comes only the ARM basic design and manufacturing capacity. Speed ​​is also on the new Nand controller. It is now water protected without Apple making a Brouhei drum. Yes, but guaranteed with timely security updates and major system updates. Together with the unique feature Privacy for me the killer argument for iPhones. If Android then Nexus. Yesterday, but I read a guide to the OTA update for marshmallow, first I thought that satire is so complicated is ... the same applies to backup solutions.
8228	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Jan K.	4	From grade 2 to 6s - field report after 6 months	2016-05-04	de	First of all to anyone who reads this. I am neither IOS nor Android fanboy. I just write here my personal impressions on the iPhone. I do not mention technical details at all. Whether a smartphone now has 1,000 or 1,000,000 points in any benchmark does not itch me. The main thing is that it runs smoothly and stable! My conclusion is at the bottom! I really only go into things that have attracted me either very positive or negative. Whether this and that cell phone is now nicer, thinner or faster itches me not. My reason for buying was neither the iPhone as "" status symbol "" nor the possibly high resale value. My grade 2 had served me almost 3 years very faithful service, but then I wanted to have something "" new "". And why not even an iPhone, if everyone is raving about it ._- Pros -_- Battery life: Often criticized. I, however, come with the battery easily a whole day. From 5 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock in the evening the iPhone only runs on the battery. In the evening I still have about 20% - 30%. I'm not a permanent user. Whatsapp, Facebook, emails, music and Youtube are distributed throughout the day. For comparison, with my grade 2 I managed 1 1/2 days. Speed: The iPhone 6s is really damn fast. Apps open in felt milliseconds and you can work immediately. I did not have to wait for a single app until I got started. -Haptic: The 6s is just the right size. 4.7-inch screen diagonal are enough for me completely. At Note 2 the size disturbed me from time to time ... especially with a flip case made of leather you had the feeling to have a tablet in your hand. Operation General: The 6s is my first iPhone ever, so had I get used to IOS on the first day. However, one gets along very quickly, which I noticed positively.-Loud / silent switch: For me, really a feature that I do not want to do without. Instead of setting the phone silent in any menu, it is sufficient to push the switch up or down. For one or the other sounds banal now, because it is not really something special, but since I use it so often, I'm glad for not having to turn on the screen every time.Camera: That really impressed me. My Note 2 was already taking some good pictures, but the 6s gets it out again. I am very convinced of the speed and the quality. A cool feature is the flashing display in a "selfie" in bad light. -Lock screen: Here, incoming messages can be answered directly with a swipe to the left, without having to unlock the iPhone. Incoming e-mails are also displayed here with a short text. Control Center: A swipe from the bottom of the screen draws up a menu in which, among other things, the volume of the app can be changed. It is also possible to switch on / off the W-LAN, flashlight etc. here. Very useful for small hands if you have problems getting to the top of the screen. Sound via AUX: Personally, I would rate the sound quality of the iPhone higher than that of Note 2. Heights are clearer and the basses are also very well balanced. I had always set the Equalizer R & B on both my Note 2 and 6s now. Siri: I admit, except in the car, I barely use Siri. However, I've never had problems with the language assistant so far, and especially in the car, Siri is very useful to me. For skipping a song or calling a friend, I do not have to pick up the phone. This comes very close to the points account. Display: The size of the display is optimal for me. The brightness and the representation of white areas are really much better compared to the rating 2. Colors come across just as well. - 3D Touch: Like Siri, I only use 3D Touch in everyday life for one purpose. If you press a little harder on the keyboard, you can move the cursor while writing in the text. I use this feature very often, as it's much easier and faster than typing around in the written text with my thumb. - One-handed mode: I use it a lot. Although I do not have the tiniest hands, I can not get to the top of the screen without taking my little finger under the phone. By tapping the Touch ID sensor twice, the image reduces to about half and you get into apps, for example. No problem with the top bar. NIGHT SHIFT: A really good option. I've set Night Shift automatically for me from 2200 clock. The image becomes warmer as the eyes relax noticeably and you will not be so much blinded by the screen when it's dark. Contrast -_- Delayed Display: May be the only iPhone 6s owner I own Problem has. However, it now often happened to me that the display remained dark when pressing the Home button and / or the lock button.After several repetitions, it went on. I first thought I had turned off the iPhone, but this was not the case. - Touch ID: Despite clean and fat-free fingers, the Touch ID sensor sometimes does not recognize my fingerprint. Why is that I do not know until today. Often it goes in immediately, then again not. - WhatsApp pictures: Yes, this problem is known. One can create under IOS no "WhatsApp folder" as with Samsung, in which then automatically the received pictures are secured. Everything is saved in the "Recordings" folder. For me, this is one of the biggest annoyances on the iPhone. And the pictures of "shots" in a "WhatsApp folder" to push me in the long run but then too stupid. The same problem is synonymous with iCloud. I put on the PC in the cloud a folder with the name "Computer" and drag pictures into this folder, these are not only shown in "Computer", but also in recordings. I do not understand why you can not turn that off. - WhatsApp "Connect": Maybe hardcore iPhone owners do not understand it, but here's the problem. If you want to write a message in case of poor or missing reception, you have to wait until WhatsApp has connected. Before you can not enter or send a message. On Android it is possible to write and send messages even if you are offline. This will be sent automatically if a connection exists. I do not understand why I'm allowed to wait on the iPhone every time WhatsApp connects. That really upset me and annoy me in the long run just yet. - iTunes compulsion: Maybe some iPhone fans now write under this review "Why are you upset, you knew that from the beginning". Yes you are right. I knew I was tied to iTunes with an iPhone. Nevertheless, I do not think it's nice. iTunes offers me personally no greater benefit. A simple option, like sorting files with specially created folders on Android, would have been more than enough for me. But you can not have everything. - Reverse exchange of music: I have not yet managed to pull music from my iPhone to my PC. The meaning of this "blockade" does not open to me. There are probably programs that can do that with detours, but that can not be the solution .- (Safari sometimes very slowly): I think about this problem, because no one is forced to use Safari. Safari was often very slow for me over any Wi-Fi network. I then have the DNS server on Google's 8.8.8.8 changed. Now it works better. No widgets: Widgets are not always useful, but I miss the weather widget already very much. Just look how the weather is, without having to open an app, I'm already missing. Songs can not be used as a ringtone: Another thing I do not understand. I can not set songs from my library as a ringtone. It should indeed, as in the exchange of music, be feasible via detours, but even here I do not understand the meaning behind .- "Back Button": That was clear to me from the beginning. In an app, I come back to IOS only if I tap the graphic "Back Button" on the top left. I miss Samsung's "back button" bottom right anyway. Video playback: I had synonymous more often the problem that YouTube videos, no matter what W-LAN, at 720P / 60FPS partly jerky. Maybe a YouTube update fixes this here. Video App: When I sync videos from my PC via iTunes with my iPhone, they will be saved in the Video app. I do not like it because I can not send the videos in this app. Pity vibration intensity can not be adjusted: In my opinion, the intensity could be increased slightly. In the motorcycle jacket e.g. I often do not realize that I am being called. Unfortunately, I do not hear the ringtone due to the wind noise (MX helmet). Camera hangs now and then: With the dark display, the only "software error" that I have found so far. When you start the app, the picture simply stops and nothing happens anymore. I have to quit the camera app and start again so I can take a picture. -NFC not unlocked: Personally, I think it's a pity. NFC offers cool options that unfortunately can not be used with the iPhone. Maybe that will happen. Conclusion: I'm completely honest. I do not regret buying the iPhone 6s! It's really a good phone that does a lot right. But here, too, there are things that are not quite optimal. However, for my part, I must say that I will change in a year or two. I miss the benefits that an Android phone has (whether Samsung, HTC or Huawei). That's it.
8229	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Martin	3	The phone for Apple disciples	2016-05-04	de	Is just a great phone, but unfortunately also very expensive.What do you do if woman necessarily wants this phone? Buy ... and be happy even with an Android device ;-)
8230	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	con2amazon	5	Upgrade vom iPhone 4s	2015-10-01	de	I'll make it short: Tests confirm a great camera, the battery keeps in moderate use including several hours of music streaming a good two days, the device is extremely lightweight, extremely robust and in terms of processing the absolute premium class. I think discussions ala "" Android there is the same performance for the fraction of the price "" or "" Apple wants to cup only "" or "" The software narrows that I do not pay with "" does not help anything. Either one can relate to the philosophy Either you accept the closed and thus secure system, or not. Either you accept a premium price for premium quality, or not. I know what I have to Apple, have found in Android no equivalent device, whose manufacturer I would feel comfortable because of the product support and have paid the price of just under 900 €. And I think the phone, including the Apple software universe, is worth it.
8231	iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	LH	4	Very good, except for a few small details!	2016-03-22	de	Hi, I bought an iPhone 6S in 64 GB after the HTC One M8.The feel and look are once again unique and set standards! The performance anyway, because the device and software from one house. Since a small dual-core enough to reach the performance of an 8Core Android phones! This protects the battery and allows a slim design! The only thing that really bothers me are little things, like the very complicated setting of songs as a ringtone, etc ...
8232	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	DrMabuse	5	Change from the 5S	2015-09-28	de	I have this iPhone unlike most reviewers actually, now for 2 days. A contract extension was due, my 5S is now my wife (with the way, I was very satisfied). Well then the 6S. Apple typical just the existing update on it, done. Since all (!) Android phones can cut off a thick slice of. How easy and round this is. That was also the reason why I finally stayed with the iPhone after many attempts with various androids. Of course, not everything is perfect here. Still, the whole package is just right, even if it's expensive. But even Samsung now demands horrendous Preise.Im comparison to the 5S first falls on the size, but to which one gets used within a very short time. For me now ideal, big enough to surf the Internet and look nice photos, small enough to be reasonably operable. The 6S is incredibly fast, not only as far as the fingerprint sensor is concerned, but also when loading websites etc. 3D Touch is a nice gimmick, but it's still under implemented in iOS and third-party apps. That will come, it works great already. Battery is enough for the 6S well over a day, even with intensive use. Photo quality is not so important for me now, I think, since most "" Premium "" - Handys today not much. Overall, I am so very satisfied again, the only criticism that I have concerns the reception quality. Here I have the feeling that in comparison to the 5S has deteriorated, sometimes I can not understand interlocutors, at LTE in the telecom network in the middle of the city actually an absurdity. But that can change, update would be submitted later. All in all 4.5 stars, because today is Monday, I round generously. Update 19.10 .: Meanwhile, there were no more crashes, reception is 1A, the thing is running bombastic. In the evening I still have nearly 40% battery (minimum) and completely satisfied.

In addition, Apple has added at the camera resolution and the pace. Apple collects plus points with the handy and slim design, with a high working speed and its very sharp 3D touch display. Negatives on the other hand by the permanently installed battery, a non-existent memory card slot and optical image stabilizer.

8239	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Thomas	5	Excellent smartphone! Review of a Galaxy S4 / S6 changer	2015-11-01	de	Hi, I have after the S4 / S6 iPhone 6S in 64 GB increased and thus leave the Android OS for the time being. The iPhone I did not buy at Amazon (1019 ¬) but at Media Markt (849 ¬). Impression after a Week iPhone 6S use. The iPhone feels like a one-stop shop. Great look, great processing. The battery holds and holds. Even if the battery has become smaller, it lasts longer than most Android with the thick Akkus.Morgens at 8 o'clock at 100%, with some phone calls, check e-mail more often, online banking I'm at 18 o'clock at 73%. Standby time is terrific like the macbooks. Barely loses% over the night. Runs very smoothly, fingerprint very fast, high data security (rights of the apps can be easily limited). More impressions after 2 weeks The battery continues to keep excellent by s.o. even with Powerusing I am at over 60% on a working day of 10h. Constant phone calls, use notes, send e-mail, Internet research, news apps. The synchronization is of course made great no matter where I write what (notes / calendar) Mac or iCloud it lands on the iPhone and vice versa. The camera is also great. Pictures are similar to the S6 Edge pictures. Here, the ghosts divide between camera Phanatikern.Force Touch is nice but I personally use little. The display is crisp and very bright and very pleasant colors. The OS is of course strongly based on OSX and MacUser should find themselves very quickly cope anyway .Siri has been developed significantly and now understands very well. Dates, alarms, reminders, photos, phone calls, navigations are no problem for Siri. Even something like "" Siri I have a cold or I'm sick "" Siri understands and suggests doctors in your area. Super thing.Klare Kaufempfehlung.Long again Android fanatics claim the iPhone 6S is technically not up to par. The Geekbench tests prove just the opposite. In the area of ​​performance, all current smartphones are facing the rear of the iPhone. It does not need any, yes, but I have an 8 core processor to come.
8240	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	Mario	5	Top product with great workmanship	2015-10-14	de	First of all: I do not go into comparisons with Android devices or the technical specifications, as you can read this elsewhere or my knowledge is rather limited. This can explain better to other users. For me, the principle of 'it just works' is more in the foreground. I played with the idea last year to buy an iPhone 6, but honestly was deterred by 'bendgate'. However, I liked the design very much, which is why I switched from the 5s to the 6s (64 GB version) (the 5s wanders on to my friend). The device was Apple typical (ordered directly from Apple) very fast since 'on 9.10. ordered, on 13.10. (yesterday) it was perfectly packed and delivered to the point. The packaging as always simple, but nothing is missing (cable + headphones as always there). The phone itself was configured in a few minutes, contacts / profiles etc. loaded and ready. I appreciate that at Apple, that the settings are easily adopted. The workmanship outside is top 'me personally, the easily protruding camera does not bother at all. Have the phone packed in a Fitbag case, with which I have the iPhone 5, 5s and an old HTC made very good experiences. The speed increase compared to the 5s is gigantic. The apps open without any delay, Touch ID works much faster when setting up than the 5s. The screen is very well lit and perfectly adequate for the average consumer. I use the phone for surfing, checking emails, whatsapps, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, various offline apps, Tripadvisor, to book hotels etc. 'So as a real small pocket computer, which allows me next to the IPad Air 2, that I the Computer at home hardly ever use. Force Touch is a nice feature, but it is supported by not too many apps. I also needed a few tries to get that done, because at first I did not know that you have to press firmly on the display before it works. In Mail, however, it is very handy, Preview / Quick functions like a "" New Mail "" are great. I have not tried Siri, but I usually use it very often.The dictation feature works well on IOS9 and has slightly improved again for IMO. I mainly use it to dictate longer mails at home on the couch on the tablet or on the phone. To the camera: This has improved significantly compared to the 5s version. I use a camera separately on holiday, but for very fine snapshots it is definitely enough. Very much improved over the 5s version is the front camera, which now does more than just acceptable pictures. Even the live pictures are a nice feature to play with when boring. In short, it's Apple, it just works. I can understand 100% when many say the phone is too expensive for what it offers. I just like the synchronization, but I would call myself very Apple-affine, since I had the iPhone 5 increased 'but also use Android (HTC company phone) and Windows privately. I work at home on a MacBook, working on an iMac, and I still own IPad Air 2 and now the 6s. Synchronization of all programs, emails, photos and Apple TV is easy and without a problem possible. My conclusion is therefore: Who like me and my girlfriend is already in the Apple universe, has the money left over and at least from the 5s changes, I can only recommend the 6s after a day of use. Otherwise, you are certainly just as well served with a high-end Android and the iPhone 6, because until Force Touch, the IMO is the main feature of the 6s, is going really well, it will probably take a while. Update (23.10.) : Unfortunately, my update of this week MO did not go through, so another attempt to recharge my battery. I was able to do some battery tests now. For me he keeps on 'normal' usage (WhatsApp, WIFI at work and at home, Bluetooth always off, Facebook, Safari, Twitter, Instagram, a few photos, a few documents and a few emails) really very long , Last week I managed 63 (!) Hours (16% rest battery) and 54 hours (24% rest battery). But I have to say that I close all applications at night and go into the power-saving mode, also the consumption is very much related to what else everything is enabled or disabled. For example, I have always disabled background updates and location services because they are eating too much battery. When power is used, I'm also well over the day, at the moment I'm just over 20 hours and still have 46% Akku.Vielleicht I have with my model just lucky or the difference to the 5s seems to me so gigantic (with the I've just come for a day use, often just over the day), but for my user behavior, the battery-added value is immense.Noch a tip to the live photos: If you do not need the feature rather disable, because the pictures but need a lot of space.
8241	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	XXX	5	light	2016-01-02	de	For me one of the best phones. Sophisticated software, great camera, best music and also the design is fine. The only drawback: it is not non-slip from the back. But use a Case.Has previously G3 / G4 / One M9 / Lumia 930 / 4s / 5sThe G4 had some better camera, but was not optimal in the usability. One M9 bad camera, Nokia not mature. Overall, the iPhone has the best components in one device and a solid and reliable software (sometimes slower than Android)
8242	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	SacredMetal	5	Review of an Android switcher ...	2015-09-27	de	Review of the iPhone 6s Plus, space gray, 128 GB.First of all, I have accompanied the development of smartphones from the beginning, I am not a "fanboy" or otherwise "bought" or biased. After a few years in the Android warehouse with u.a. Devices from Sony, HTC and Samsung (I used the Note series for three years), I am now back on iOS. My last iPhone was the iPhone 4 - and since then a lot has happened, that much is already betrayed. As an iPad user, I am now used to the quality of the feel of Apple products, yet the first touch of the latest generation of devices was something special. It feels fantastic and looks just as good. Clearances, etc., one searches in vain. As a former note user, the size of the 6s Plus is also nothing special for me - in my opinion, it even feels a little thinner and narrower in the jeans pocket, even though the measurements are even a bit above the note level. Quickly the nano SIM inserted and brought the installation process behind it, immediately inspires the very bright and crisp display. ppi values ​​of over 800 (Hello Sony) are of course not achieved, but (of course) are no single pixel recognizable. The hammer is the speed increase of the Touch ID function. Pressing the home button without unlocking the display is almost impossible. Tip: Just take another finger. ;) Of course I miss the comparison to the pre-series, but also the camera excited. The videos look fantastic (60 fps is enough, 4K costs 375MB per minute movie!), The photos are crisp and almost DSLR quality. I'm looking forward to the first printouts. The speakers are beautiful, ohmic, loud, without reaching HTC quality, the included headphones are also of good quality. The new 3D touch feature immediately thrills and will, in my opinion, be in the next one The operating speed of the 6s Plus is otherwise awesome - here you can easily (!) Leave the Android competition with eight-core processors and 3 or 4 GB of RAM behind. Big praise to Apple, which once again show how the interaction of hardware and software can work. However, the most enthusiastic I am of a thing in which I was spoiled by the grade 1-4 - the battery life. Example today30, now at 14:00, the battery is still at an incredible 75%. And you know how hard you use new devices. Surfed, watched videos, made videos and photos and played with iMovie. Really the hammer - and maybe the reigns of CHIP, which criticize the battery life of the 6s so sharp, get a new test device. Something can not be right there ... A few criticisms I have also: - The detour via iTunes, "" just "" a couple of albums on the iPhone to push annoys even after years, especially iTunes iTunes pretty much the worst program World is unlocked the iPhone, I've observed several times that the screen freezes and you have to wait one or two seconds before you can do something. This review I will overhaul in the coming weeks every now and then to answer questions, To note down further observations or to describe problems. Conclusion: The iPhone 6s Plus is next to the M7 from HTC not only the most beautiful smartphone, which I have owned so far, but also the best. More than here you can hardly wait for a smartphone ...

Know me but with Android phones what the operation and ease of use is quite good aus.Bin never a brand really remained loyal. Had, among other things, schonsmiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: And I was previously an Apple hater !!! And why? Because one hears also constantly from hardcore Android lovers, how shit Apple should be. Too expensive, not compatible with other mobile phones and PC's, anyway gehypet in vain, apps cost or does not exist ... If only the mobile phone and not has the right PC, eh is all too complicated anyway. Now my sister (also Android fan) got an Apple 6s plus and was sooooooooo excited! She never wants to have anything else again. 2 days later my xperia Z3 Compact broke down and so a new mobile phone had to come. And I gave Apple a chance too. And I love my new mobile !!! It is easy to use, fast, big enough but still handy, high quality processed, the battery lasts a whole day. That was my biggest concern. Until now I did not have any connection problems with my PC. Bluetooth leaves Apple but only on IOS devices, but a star deduction. Now I'm convinced and do not regret the change üüüüüüü not at all !!!!!

Only there you would not get the 469 euros. Technically, nothing is off.
8248	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	Oscar00072009	5	What's wrong with my battery?	2015-09-30	de	My new iPhone 6s still has 100% battery after 4 hours stand-by. It definitely lasts longer than my old IPhone 6. No idea what they tested, but I'm thrilled. There are recessions reporting the same thing. Is the migration from the iPhone 6 to the 6S worth it? In my opinion yes! The sensor of the home button is amazing. Just click and you are on the main page. The IPhone 6, it's really annoying. With this 3D touch, I can not do much (I thought). In safari left edge press a little harder and you can switch between your apps. The home button is becoming more and more superfluous, real madness. So I'm totally excited. In the AppStore many complain that new games like Fifa 16 and co. stutter. For me there is nothing jerking at all.Welcome to the new smartphone games era !!! Contra loss of value in the iPhone rather low.

8250	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	DenBa	5	Quality super	2015-11-02	de	The wheel was certainly not reinvented with the 6s, who should expect that the purchase is superior. I am with 2 interruptions to Samsung and Microsoft Lumia are the iPhone 4 at Apple and am the most satisfied, the trip to Samsung and Lumia was interesting but in the end too much compromise. The iphone has its weaknesses like any other smartphone it has, but for me it's not an issue since i personally just think ios is a round thing with super apps (i found Lumia rather frightening, unfortunately it was me) Handy ansich geviel).
8251	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Patrick	5	An expensive but one of the best smartphones on the market!	2015-10-24	de	I have to admit, I was very skeptical about the iPhone 6S, but it really took my breath away. The workmanship is impeccable: - The display is bright, colorful, very rich in contrast and has a sharp white value. as well as the glass of the display is very hard, stable and the price very reasonable- The camera takes sharp photos ... and now the points that were very important to me and where I had my doubts. It said: The battery is weak and there is there still this thing with the processor ... The A9 is a sharp processor! It runs with 2GB of RAM and is a real machine! The interaction between IOS and the hardware is just perfect! The battery life is awesome! I am very pleasantly surprised at how economical the processor works and now comes the big hit: It was in many forums and websites, the Apple A9 at Samsung in 14nm and TSMC in 16nm make. The processor of TMSC (according to extreme tests on YouTube and co.), Although, according to paper, the Samsung should be more economical, be more economical and be cooler under load.It has been very annoyed to the next, what Apple has probably thought? I found out about a test app that is in my device the A9 from Samsung and I'm very satisfied with it. I can tell you, it's jacket like pants, which of the two chips is in your iPhone, even if some extreme tests are done and then they are released and cause some discussion again. I think that also has to do with the interaction with the software. Yes, maybe the TSMC is currently more economical by 2-3%, but the chip from Samsung is a big advancement and I think the tide will turn soon;) The whole device is just great and worth the money, of course. ..740 euros are already a lot of money and you get for less already a top smartphone, but everyone must decide for themselves. I think this device is currently the best in compactness, performance and workmanship that you can get on the market.

8254	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Marco	1	Apple has served its time	2016-10-24	de	I was actually a happy Apple user. Had always IPhones, MacBooks and IPads. Above all the reliability and stability of the software as well as the optimal software tuning on the hardware let me buy again and again a new Apple product despite the clearly higher price compared to competing products. Also, the compatibility of the profucts was very good. In the meantime, I have bought laptops and smartphones from other manufacturers with the software Windows and Android, due to a significantly better price-performance ratio, but I am always returned to Apple products mainly due to the simple and reliable condition. After I had the iPhone 6s exactly 1 year, started several massive problems at the same time. The iPhone 6s crashes completely for no reason despite the simplest applications. It always switches off at a battery charge of 20 - 40% and goes on (if at all) only briefly for a few seconds again. The software is of course always up to date. Resolutions did not solve any of the problems mentioned. Also, I exclude a misuse and handling of battery or charging. What a coincidence that these problems exactly 1 year after the purchase of the product (840 € im Apple Store) while Apple is still as good as all other electronics manufacturers ONLY 1 year warranty on its products instead of the usual 2-year warranty, as practiced even by the cheapest no-name manufacturers. A rogue who thinks of planned obsolescence? I will not now as planned, the new IPhone 7 grow and buy no other iPhone. There are some alternatives and fortunately I am not "brand fixed" which makes me open to all manufacturers. Recommend everyone to do the same, because as we know: "" Competition gives wings to the market "".

And I can bend EVERY smartphone !! : D But I think I'm not moving from 6 to 6s, but the 7 next year is definitely coming into the house: DDAlso make it good out there and do not let it annoy, if the Hater set off here again;)

8257	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	LosSantosGamer	3	Old school technique	2016-03-26	de	I'm not a fan of Apple. I think the products of the manufacturer but not bad. After all, Apple brought out the first smartphone in the world, namely the good old iPhone. And why the iPhone costs so much on Amazon is incomprehensible to me. Technically came quickly other companies, which relatively quickly introduced the HD display. Unfortunately, Apple only stayed with the processing. The processing of Apple products is always the first cream! Be it smartphones, tablets, laptops or even Applewatches. For technical reasons, however, those products are completely outdated. But then came the iPhone 6, which for the first time really offers an HD display. At this time, there was already the Samsung Galaxy S4 & S5. Both smartphones each have a full HD display! (1920x1080p) From the iPhone 6 I was initially excited! Great workmanship, HD display, quite fast performance and the optimal size of 5 inches. Only the camera is not necessarily great. The iPhone 6s came a little later with the "" special feature "" that for the first time 3D Touch was used. But is the iPhone 6s good? The display has not changed compared to the iPhone 6. Still a HD resolution. Neither FHD nor QHD. For 2015, almost a no-go. But the colors are absolutely great. Realistic and yet strong. Texts are not as printed, pixels are clearly visible, only black and white are good. The performance is typical IOS neat. Games run mostly smoothly, there is no jerkiness and burglaries when running multiple apps, there is not. Apple can absolutely absolutely super. The camera dissolves with 12 MP. 4K photos and videos are possible. 4K can only be recorded in 30 fps. During the day, the 6s makes very good photos. Rich in detail, hardly any noise, great sharpness and good colors. Unfortunately nothing works at night. It is rushing without end, colors are pale, pure details and complete blur. And even with flash, the pictures are extremely dark. Videos are a disaster in 4K. It jerks everything and 4K is barely recognizable. The processing is still the best that Apple has to offer. The iPhone 6 has changed nothing. The choice of materials is limited to aluminum and glass. However, Apple has fixed the error that the iPhone does not bend.But you can expect that in a nearly 800 ¬ expensive smartphone! The aluminum feels extremely good in the hand. These perfect curves make for a nearly impeccable overall picture. The buttons are also incorporated into the aluminum. It wobbles nothing and the pressure point is also strong. The battery is relatively small in the iPhone 6. Within 6 hours this is dead with normal consumption. At 6s I had the impression that this was improved. I manage with the Smarti just 1 day (16 hours). However, I did not do more than whatsapp, little internet and some gaming. For example, I can do it with a Sony Xperia Z3, 1.5 days. And that only with a HD display. Apple should rethink the plan to make their phones even thinner. The battery capacity disappears. In addition, I find it nachwievor absolutely shit that Apple always firmly installed the battery. This makes it impossible to retrofit larger batteries. The Samsung Galaxy S4, I have a 7000 mAh installed and the battery lasted 2 weeks. Unfortunately not possible at Apple (and many other manufacturers). Also not possible is the retrofit of Apple products. That was already the case with the first iPhone and unfortunately today too. And that definitely does not matter. The built-in battery is not a criterion for many, but the missing SD card slot. In Samsung, this had to make way for the Galaxy S6. The iPhone 6s still impossible. And 64 GB are just not that much these days. Alone through apps and music, the phone is already too. That's one of the reasons why Apple is definitely not my favorite. It's even better that the fingerprint sensor responds very quickly. You pull the 6s out of your pocket and it's already unlocked. Within 1 second! Simply super. In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 6s is an okay device. The performance is great, the workmanship is impeccable. The display offers great colors and the black as well as whiteness is good. But the resolution is completely outdated. The battery does not convince and the camera is unusable, especially at night. The battery is not changeable, the memory is not expandable and in general the phone is just made for fans of Apple.

8259	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Steffi1987	2	Too expensive for the actual product	2016-04-18	de	I am in possession of the shell since the end of January. The processing of the shell is ok. However for the price I would have liked a higher quality processing. Glued parts of the case were not really glued fit. The longevity of the case leaves a lot to be desired. For me breaks after the short use since the plastic of the holder for the smartphone. The iPhone has never fallen down. The phone is generally in my hand, on the desk or in my purse. Therefore, not understandable why the shell breaks. In itself, the window and the recess are very convenient. I can not determine a worse reception by using the case. Once again I would not buy the case for this high price anymore.

8265	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	Alexander Bakurin	3	iPhone My true opinion	2016-01-10	de	In my opinion, Apple has a monopoly on smartphones. By IOS. I've been out and about with many Android smartphones and even a Windows phone, and I have to say none of them has met the criteria I expect from a smartphone. Reliability and speed. IOS can, however, and that's why I consider the iPhone as my only choice and that's why I have to swallow that bitter price. Monopoly eben.Jedoch this smartphone is anything but perfect. Subjectively, but worth mentioning is the design. Ugly and dysfunctional in my eyes. Good ugliness left out, the functionality of the design is a fact. Or the lack of it better said. The compact size of the iPhone would be a big +. However, good handling is completely prevented by the round design. You think the phone would slip out of your hand, so handy is the design ... The screen has a catastrophic resolution. Not even HD !!! I think that's because otherwise the battery life goes completely down, but it's just frustrating to be sitting next to a guy who has a cheap android smartphone but which resolves with Full HD and then looks at his 800 € cell phone and realizes how much sharper the full HD display of cheap android dissolves. Do not let anyone tell you something! The difference is huge! Those who claim the opposite are either ignorant or still living in the Stone Age and have never seen a FHD smartphone display. Since Apple has to do something.Akkulaufzeit is grottig. In standby, the phone consumes almost nothing which is great, but in use it goes down. Do not listen to anyone who says: "I got 10 hours out of powerusing"! Nonsense that is absolute nonsense! Since I do not want to know what is Powerusing for these people. Orient yourself best s.den Screenontime! That's the best measure of what you can orientate yourself. There were days when I surfed the internet with the phone almost non stop and watched YouTube, and after about 4 hours I wanted to reconnect it. Less than 10% left. Brightness was almost always regulated to 3/4 high. 4 hours is not much... The current top smartphones in the field of battery power create 6 hours in such use. The camera is unfortunately a step backwards compared to its predecessor. Unfortunately, the focus is not very precise. Still small comments: Apple has to downsize the edges of the smartphone. That does not work as it is now. That I had to exchange my iPhone 3 times, of course, is not synonymous. Twice pixel error and once casual homebutton. The camera must never protrude out of the case. The iPhone for doing thicker and extra battery pure. 3D Touch is not working properly yet. The cursor mode is very imprecise and it frustrates me if the cursor then always lands next to where I would like him. A calendar and note widget on the homescreens with which can also be interacted with is necessary. Processing the buttons needs to be improved. Sometimes they become more relaxed after some time and sometimes from the beginning. If they manage to make a button so tight, then all the buttons should be like this, otherwise it's a defect. Also very important: Apple must give people the opportunity to manage the files in the iPhone itself. And via filemanager. In the Android Playstore there is the File Explorer. Something like that would be very welcome on the IOS platform. Also the autocorrection of the spelling needs to be optimized. It is so obtrusive that I unfortunately had to turn it off. It bothers more than it helps. I would like to give the iPhone 6s the best 2 stars, as much price in my view is not justified, and the iPhone technically on the hardware and software side of the time lag behind. However, for me personally, there are some key elements that are fundamental to a smartphone for me, and this in my eyes only the iPhone met (reliability, speed). Because there are no obvious alternatives for me, I have to improve my rating of the iPhone a bit and I therefore give 3 Sterne.Ich I could give anyone with this review my personal experience with this iPhone model closer and contribute to a good purchase decision
8266	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Gisela G	2	Gisela	2016-12-26	de	The design is beautiful, because it is noble. The processor is super fast and all games run fluently.

8269	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Jasmin W.	5	In the color rose gold a dream	2015-10-30	de	I think the color is absolutely beautiful. I had the iPhone in rose gold together with a brush set by Luvia Luvia Cosmetics - Golden Queen Brush Set - 16 pcs. Cosmetic Brush Set - Including Make Up Brush Holder for storing the Vegan Makeup Brush Rossgold and a Michael Course Watch Michael Kors Ladies Wrist Watch XL Chronograph Quartz Stainless Steel MK5412bestellt. I like to keep it uniform and find myself the rose gold is absolutely noble. No matter what, cell phone, brush or clock. Everything is great in color. So now for the iPhone. What can I say, it is like the predecessor only faster. That you can press the display is initially funny, but then you do not want to without this function. If I use the phone of my husband, which does not have this feature, then that's funny.
8270	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	hannesle	3	Too expensive compared to similar	2015-11-17	de	For a while I had the Xperia Z5 and the iphone 6s in parallel. However, both have sent back, since both of me could not convince 99% ig. My girlfriend has a Galaxy S6. Here is my opinion about the 6s- The mobile is extremely nimble. You realize that hardware and software work together perfectly - the camera I find (especially in comparison to the xperia z5) very good, above all, you do not have to long back and forth to get good pictures. Night shots makes the S6 clearly better.- The display is very good, a FullHD display but would not hurt. Alone, nothing is noticeable, with high-resolution images and videos, the s6 but sharper. Since this only really stands out in direct comparison, this is negligible for me. Overall, the display convinces.- The phone feels very good in the hands. A hand-feeling negative: - very ugly and much too thick black bars above and below. Even thicker than the Xperia z5- much expensive, especially since only the 64 GB version makes sense. For less money you get better mobile phones overall. Unless you absolutely want only IOS.- no NFC- no wireless charging- IOS customizable to zero on the wallpaper- no widgets- it's not possible to close all apps running in the background together. They almost have to be closed one by one. If you are used to Android, you will have problems with the back button, as it will not work on some apps, others on the bottom, and others. The quality of the speakers is only satisfactory, however This was not a negative argument for me personally because I always use headphones or in the car bluetooth. On the other hand, it can be of interest to someone using the cellphone speaker. For me, IOS is a much too closed system and far too adaptable. The ITunes forced annoying nerves annoying.- No real multitasking possible (for example, youtube and browser simultaneously use each other)
8271	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	2	Handy = Well, service = flop	2016-04-06	de	I bought the iPhone 6s about 1month before Christmas 2015 and had to notice with astonishment (about 2 months later) that dust in the form of small black dots under the screen was visible. So I sent in the device and got it back after a whopping 7 WEEKS. The screen has been replaced, but there is again a black dot in the middle of the screen. I've really wondered (because of the 7 months and no real improvement) if people at Apple are unable to work properly! So for this price (€ 740) it was a total REINFALL! NO PURCHASE RECOMMENDATION !!!! Buy 740 cheeseburgers at mc's, because you will definitely get more for your money! Price-performance is not right at Apple !!

It has entered everything correctly and yet it does not work at Apple.com .. I did not continue at all but the iPhone broke and disposed of directly.

In my summerhouse we have a good data connection over 3G and 4G - with devices like the (much cheaper old model) Galaxy A3. Only with the expensive 6s iPhone is it very slow. Sometimes the connection is completely out, you have to wait 1 minute. The screen is not high resolution, the man recognizes immediately. All in all, a nice device top processing but purely technically a beginner model.
8278	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	Loris	1	Worst iPhone I've ever owned	2016-02-14	de	I had an iPhone 4, 2x 4s and a 5s and I have a MacBook Pro and Apple TV is so familiar with Apple products and actually appreciate the quality and ease of use of the products. The 6s is the first iPhone, which I am very disappointed. For one, it does not bring any meaningful novelties and bores through it. It's the first iPhone that I do not think wow cool part. That alone would be a pity, of course, but not a real problem. What on the other hand is a problem for me is that after just 4 months makes problems that I know otherwise only from hearsay other smartphones. The battery of the 6s discharges faster than any other iPhone. In one day, the battery has 40% and it just goes out and requires power. On another day, it consumes between 60-80% charge within 6 hours without a charger. Even my 4 year old 4s lasts much longer. As if that was not enough, the 6s has so many software problems, like no other of my iPhones before that. Even a 1/8 Huawei Y550 works better, probably because Steve Jobs is no longer living. The first iPhone after his death, he had probably still been involved or Apple still had ideas of him in the bag, but they seem to be used up. In the meantime, I have the feeling that you only pay for the name at Apple and not the wonderful uniqueness and quality that an iPhone once had. Of course NOT a buy recommendation!

8280	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	M. Sietas	1	Too little for the money!	2015-12-29	de	I do not really know what to think of the positive reviews written here. My family has been using Apple phones for a while, but not me. Nobody could really convince me so far to buy an Apple device. Although there are also regular updates for the devices but these only cause problems. Starting with shortened battery life up to suspended IOS. And I had to judge it again and again as an old Android root user. Have screwed around on these iphones often and I can only say one thing: Save the nice money. Apple should finally start to develop better devices for this price range. Highend devices with Android operating system allow more options, that goes with Apple only with the annoying Jailbreak variant. Apple devices are in my opinion for users who prefer a very simple operation or are simply overwhelmed with Android. Anyway, Apple has not convinced me so far. This has nothing to do with the price, because you get at Samsung and Co simply more.

8283	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	FcBayernGrafBecker	1	Ugly, cheap and itunes heavy!	2015-10-18	de	Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!

8286	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Michael Hinz	1	Many vulnerabilities for 600 €?	2016-07-31	de	The iphone 6s ... a very controversial smartphone ... oh sorry IPHONE of course. I'm more of a fan of the Sony or google nexus series and always had a very bad relationship with appel products. Too expensive, no better than other brands and especially not compatible with other operating systems. These were the typical fears I had. Even if not all really true, they are nevertheless almost all true. The first problem on iphone 6s is the price in my opinion. This shocked me a lot because I am used to getting amazone often very cheap deals. Well, despite this outrageous price, I bought this smartphone angrily. Now the absolute horror began. The iPhone 6s was delivered to SPÆT ONE week for its unreliable delivery services in Germany. That did not improve my attitude towards the iPhone. In the evening after a stressful working day, I gladly unpacked the package. The actual iPhone pack looked very good and neatly processed. In this was a charging cable, a unfortunately not too restrictive instructions and of course the iPhone 6s itself. To my surprise, but no ear-plugs as is the case with many other smartphone manufacturers. Finally, the phone itself. Even if I do not like the formation of iPhones this looked quite passable. The surface is pleasant to touch, but the smartphone slipped from my hand several times a day after a week of use. The shape is not very grippy. The processing quality is so far quite okay and I noticed nothing more negtives. The color of the Displys is perfect and I liked it very well. With the size of the phone, I was not quite good enough, which could be due to the fact that my hands are not too big. Now to the most important: the use. The everyday use is actually rather impractical with this mobile because it is very large and therefore hardly fits in trouser or jacket pockets. As I said, this iPhone tested a week, but actually often wanted to use my smaller smartphone. The drive speed is actually very good. What I noticed as the only VERY POSITIVE was the battery life. Despite everyday business use and with permanently connected WLANs, I had to charge the phone only every other day. But this positive point of the battery unfortunately also brings the most negative for me with this smartphone. This problem has the complete appel series, namely the ports, etc. I, a user of Android smartphones and Windows PCs had great difficulties to couple devices ... that is for non-exclusive apple users a huge problem. So, if we were already at the extraordinary features of Apple, it should be noted as a second, very, negative point, the android user with the apple operating system not easy or difficult to cope. So it was very hard for me to get used to ios and then to regain my money. So the iPhone 6s is now back to Amazon
8287	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	FcBayernGrafBecker	1	Ugly, cheap and itunes heavy!	2015-10-17	de	Unfortunately, I have to join the 1 star reviewer! We (27 people, young team) were allowed to try the Samsung s6 edge and the Apple 6s in the company for 2 weeks! We opted 27: 0 for the Samsung s6 + edge. Against the Apple spoke the much too short battery life and this absolutely annoying dependence on ITunes! The Bendgate was still one or the other in the ear! The Samsung has a much sharper / brighter display and also has a very different caliber of camera on board. The Samsung can load in comparison to Apple totally wireless! Overall, the s6 + edge plays in a completely different league! The Samsung is a bit more expensive than the Apple but the extra expenses have been worth it in any case! The two-sided Gorilla glass Samsung is much more stable and is haptically quite different in the Hand! Samsung is clearly in the right direction compared to Apple! The Samsung has felt twice as long battery life as the Apple although the battery capacity is not so much bigger! This can only be due to the better energy management. Oh well, what we noticed here in the forum even negative, is that here Android lovers are presented as asocial resin 4 recipients who can not afford iPhone supposedly! At least we would have got the iPhone cheaper through our source of supply! ITunes I found personally to iPod times a much too overloaded old joke and now works at Apple, the hardware is cheap! Let's see what make of the still beautiful Macbook Pro, IOS they have already screwed!
8288	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Melodi	1	A joke	2016-06-11	de	When unpacking the phone looks very nice, a few hours in the hand after that but then the interest is gone again. Many less choice of apps, the battery is also a joke and you can not attach more than 3 devices when tethering ... There is definitely a lot better Android ... Never again Iphone !!

8290	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	David	1	I Phone 6S = electronic waste	2015-10-03	de	The worst thing that can happen to a smartphone is a bad battery life. The I Phone 6S is not only bad but by far the worst measured value of all time in the history of the I Phones, that's a death sentence. For me personally, it is enough to be constantly fooled by Apple! For two days, I have a Galaxy S5, that's a battery life of Apple can only dream. And the Android operating system, I now find better than IOS.Nie Apple again!
8291	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	Stefan	5	strained apple community	2015-09-12	de	As every year, the Apple community is waiting eagerly for the new iPhone and hopes for new features and features. After the presentation on 9 September is certain. Apple once again found a unique selling proposition and introduced it first. In this case, the 3D Touch. The detection of varying degrees of pressure on the touch screen. I am very curious how it will be in everyday life. It sounds very promising!
8292	iPhone 6S	32GB	Argent	A. Strassburger	2	What is really important	2015-09-26	de	The question is, if you really spend so much money, if you need the new features. Of course, everything is top-processed and innovative. But what about moisture or dust protection? Our smartphone is always with us, holidays on the beach with sand, canoe trip in the water or a birthday party, where one of you the beer or the coffee accidentally on the phone. Others offer more for less. But as a prestige object it is a real recommendation.

8296	iPhone 6S	128GB	Space Gray	ansich	3	good product except a few exceptions	2019-04-12	de	the biggest advantages are: + manageability + continuous update policy + the performance in games and general (High Singelcoreperfomance) + metal back and impeccable workmanship, feels very round and haptic very well, + very efficient and pleasant typing on the very handy and perfectly developed in-house virtual Keyboard Negative are: - The not really good sounding speaker on the bottom, it has too few midtones and too many high tones, bass is slightly present- Speichernappheit- High quality and fluidity of the video recording micro-bumpers in the system zb if I keep the power button pressed to drive the phone down the bar for swiping in a jerky animation- little Ram but very good Rammangement- if you lightly knock on the screen you can already hear a dull sound -> cavity under the display (feels not valued)
8297	iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Gray	Tobias Laser	5	Does not always have to be the newest!	2019-02-11	de	Actually it should be an iPhone XR. But after comparing 6s, 8s and XRs, I opted for base price performance for the 6s. Although the iPhone 6s has been on the market for more than three years, it runs almost as fast as its successors with IOS 12 and the camera makes very good and colorfast pictures. My 6s, which I bought here directly from Amazon, are an original packed and new device.
8298	iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Gray	May Jay	1	Speaker is very bad and after 6 months the battery is dead	2018-08-09	de	I needed an iPhone for work. Almost 240 € for an alleged exhibit I find really expensive, but I thought, then at least I get a well-functioning model. Unfortunately, one hardly hears me, when talking on the phone. It only works via loudspeaker or headset. This is really poor, since it is after all a telephone. The camera is really great and fun to shoot and take pictures with. Except for the bad speaker, I'm so satisfied. Even though I do not think the device was an exhibit. It looks more like used and badly repaired. If I had a replacement, I would have sent it back immediately. Next time I use another provider.6 months after the purchase, I can not use the device because the battery is no longer charged. Within 4 weeks, the performance decreased rapidly and in the end, I was not even allowed to remove it from the charging station because otherwise it would have gone out immediately. Now it is not even more. What else should I say? I wish I had invested the money elsewhere. That was a sad and expensive experience.
8299	iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Gray	Peter Schlemihl	5	Very nice and functional smartphone.	2019-04-14	de	How not to expect otherwise: A great device with all around perfectly functioning technology and extremely high-quality workmanship. Too bad that Apple has stopped production of 64GB devices. A small upholstery would have been very nice to me. I do not need the device with 128 GB. Therefore, I was not ready to pay the considerable additional price. But that does not detract from the overall joy of the iPhone 6s.

The device was a cheap China imitations, the already after about 12 months use the blessed blessing.Janado said that the device is unfortunately out of warranty, since only 12 months warranty on the device would be, since it is B-commodity would act and you could thus do nothing for me. In the item description was not apparent that there is no original accessories or the only 12 months warranty on the device. Usual are at Amazon 24 months. The dealer advertises the one with the Prime logo, which further confuses.

However, the phone is in perfect condition, originally delivered and with complete original accessories. Only battery capacity is at 84%, which indicates the age (or use?) Of the device. But by and large I am very satisfied, all features tested, everything works. Let's see how long :-)
8303	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gold	Lars	1	Cheating on Apple 6s	2018-12-10	de	Since I had my device for repair today (display damage) my repairer told me that it was not a new device or the original Apple 6s. He showed me that the battery is not original, it lacked a clip to stabilize the battery and a few small things that were not installed by Apple. Since I bought the device as a new product that is a huge mess and noticed only after 9 months by the exchange of the display. If I could I would give 0 stars.

Display is comfortable Large with 4.7 "" without being the same size as some other Android or Plus devices from Apple. Note: The iPhone 6s (as well as the 6s Plus) are the last iPhone with real blade connector; from the 7th you have to grab the adapter for the Lightninganschluss or Bluetooth headphones (I think personally not good). The color silver (with white front) I like visually very good. Sense supplement for the protection: - Case of Rhinoshield - especially the PlayProof protects all around; but also CrashGuard is TOP! The cases of Rhinoshield synonymous very well with protective glass or protective film. - Protective glass by Copter -> got said of Amazon for free and does its job very well!

The device has a lot of minor scratches, which I did not find so bad, because it is a used device. Unfortunately, this phone had a relatively large Kratzerfas center on the display (in the photo, unfortunately, not so good to see). In addition, it was on the back, faded by using a sleeve with logo cut so much that this was ultimately the reason why I have sent it back (s.Foto). I am a little surprised, because the seller has received good reviews and I therefore ordered. Maybe I was also sent a wrong device. Pity!

8330	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Christopher	5	Super Smartphone!	2018-02-19	de	I'm a big fan of the Apple smartphones and I have my iPhone 6s now over 2 years and will certainly have at least another 2 years! In these 2 years, my smartphone has rarely had problems, and these were really not tragic. Once off and on and the problem was fixed again. (I take care of my phone very well, I can count it on both hands, how many times I've fallen down in the last 2 years, and mostly on a rug.) Furthermore, the speed of the software despite the high Age and iOS 11 still great. I never really have a problem that the smartphone hangs open briefly when opening an app. The only thing that I can fault is the battery performance. The capacity was not as good as other new smartphones from the start and its old age and the new software updates did not make it any better, but I usually get through pretty well most of the day, even though I have all sorts of social media apps and apps Use music apps during the bus ride. Sometimes I even get two days with a load! All in all, a really great phone, which really gave me a lot of pleasure, which is why I gave another copy of my mother's birthday and she's been blown away!
8331	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Pusheen	4	Iphone 6s 64gb - detailed review	2018-02-02	de	Welcome to my review of the Iphone 6s from Apple. As a small warning to those who do not want to read a detailed review -> to the conclusion scroll. Foreword: ------------------------------ -------------- I had my Iphone 6s a total of 23 months in operation, this was in constant use until I am due to a contract extension to another device am. This device was not purchased from Amazon. Workmanship and Design: -------------------------------------------- In contrast to the little brother owns the Iphone 6s a 7000er aluminum alloy, I notice here no big difference to the predecessor up to small deviations of the dimensions and the weight. This does not fall on the whole at all. The haptic I can only as very positive rate, the device was always good and safe in the hand. The attention to detail is to be highlighted positively as with any Apple, the holes are clean, the buttons for the speakers have a pleasant pressure point. The metal frame is einfac The only downer here is that the camera lens protrudes a little over the case. The absolutely high-quality and detailverschiebt processing worthy of the full score - 5/5 Sterne.Display: --------- ----------------------------------- There is a 4.7 inch display installed, with a resolution of 750x1334 Pixel density of the Retina HD display is 326 ppi. A pixel density of 326 ppi is absolutely sufficient, everything is crisp and sharp readability is top. The viewing angle stability is here to highlight positively. The Iphone 6s is with the new so-called " "3D-touch-function" "equipped, which might already be known to some from the side of the Apple Watch (Force Touch). The device should hereby be able to respond to the different strength of a fingerprint.The new pressure detection allows the user to "open properly" without an app "" to get the most important features. A longer and firmer pressure is enough to select, for example, in the camera app between the functions Selfie video, Slo-Mo or take photo. With the mail app so for example, can navigate directly to the inbox or a new e-mail The new function requires some practice at the beginning, because as a user, if you do not tapping energetically enough on an app, not about the 3D touch features, but the app on the homescreen only starts to wobble, so you can move or erase kann.Die 3D touch feature is something new that works well and in everyday life quite useful kann.Da in the field of the display but nothing has changed, I forgive here 4.5 / 5 Sterne.Ausstattung and Performance: -------------------------------------------- In the Iphone 6s is coming The A9 processor is used, in direct comparison to its predecessor, the loading and start of 3D games is a bit faster, but this is hardly any in everyday life w The hardware is in absolute harmony with the software, it was in the whole time to exactly one crash, hangers or waiting times were very rare to record. The processed here 2gb RAM memory was always absolutely sufficient, which is relatively small. The fingerprint scanner integrated here in the home button worked in 9 of 10 cases and quickly and without much delay. Unfortunately, internal memory can not be extended by an SD card again, you have to choose between 16, 32, 64 and 128gb when buying This is then reflected in the price) The voice quality is at a very good level, both on the part of the caller and at the other end of the line. The handsfree function via the loudspeaker delivers such a good sound and is sufficiently loud to perceive. The processor and the 2 GB RAM work with the new iOS 9 software back in line and ensure a very stable, fluid and fast operation. Deduction is only for the non-expandable internal memory - here 4/5 stars. Camera: ------------------------------ -------------- On the part of the camera was the predecessor "upgraded" performed, instead of 8 triggers the iSight camera of the iPhone 6s on the back now with 12 megapixels and videos can However, this nibbles quite nicely, especially in the 16GB version, on storage space (a 30 minute 4K video and the 16GB are gone) The camera can handle particularly natural colors and score a very good score. Even in very difficult lighting conditions, such.Twilight or a cloud-covered sky. The apple can also score close-up shots, drops of water on a leaf are recognizable down to the smallest detail. The iPhone 6s now has a 5-inch rather than a 1.2-megapixel front camera. (quite useful for selfies) The retina display can now also be used as a "" selfie flash "", unfortunately, there are almost no options on the camera, which make other cameras better. For this I give 4.5 / 5 Sterne.Software and multimedia: ------------------------------------ -------- From the beginning iOS 9 is installed. Among improvements, the new operating system includes, among other things, a revised notes app. Until now, you could actually use the app only for the quick note on the edge. Now you can not just scribble your finger on the screen with a new drawing function, but also insert photos and map sections and create to-do lists. Also from an app like Safari you can directly start a note without leaving the app Also Siri, the virtual language assistant has received a "" training "", this can eg activated from standby with the words "Hey Siri".

The operating system of Apple was always up to date and worked flawlessly. Here I give 5/5 Sterne.Akku: ---------------------------------------- ---- The device is a 1715 mAh battery installed, unfortunately, you have to do without a quick charge or wireless charging. The device has a power-saving mode. Enabling this will temporarily reduce power consumption until the iPhone can be recharged. This means that retrieving emails, "" Hey Siri "" will reduce or disable the background update of apps, automatic downloads, and some visual effects After 8 hours of continuous testing of the mobile phone (Whatsapp, games, emails, etc.) you could still record 50% battery, after another 16 hours in standby mode it lost another 10%. At the end of my 24 hours of testing were still 40 % on the odometer. With these values, it is good, but not outstanding, it has no quick charge and the battery is not self-exchangeable, I award 4/5 star. Conclusion: ------------ -------------------------------- Processing / Design: 5 / 5Display: 4.5 / 5Ausstattung / Leistung: 4 / 5Camera: 4.5 / 5Software / Multimedia: 5 / 5Akku: 4 / 5Buyers of an iPhone 6s receive not only a very expensive smartphone, but also a smartphone, which they are used in almost all Ausstatt leave 100% of the details.

The operating system iOS 9 runs along with the A9 processor as recorded as a married couple for 50 years. If you attach great importance to a stable and secure system, you are well advised with the iPhone 6s. The same applies to the desire for a good camera, as long as you do not want to experiment yourself in the settings around. My Iphone 6s was almost always a loyal companion for almost 2 years, for the overall rating I forgive 4.5 / 5 Sterne.Für speak for the apple I give a clear buy recommendation!

8332	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Sahin uzun	1	An absolute freedom. Once and never again.	2018-04-30	de	An absolute impudence. Top quality or "like new" can not even be mentioned in the beginning. The smartphone had a broken screen and no small Klitsche as described, in addition to strong nicks on make corners. Scratches on the back and front, totally worn charging cable. Maximum battery power was below 82%. For a smartphone that bears the label "like new" unreasonable. Rather used. Have ordered once and do that niewkeder. I strongly discount from.
8333	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Ostseekind1812	1	Since IOS 11 only trouble !!!!	2017-11-07	de	I have the iPhone 6s since last year and have always been very satisfied. Since ios 11 was installed I only have problems. My screen turns black and it does not react anymore. The touch screen locks and I can not do anything anymore. Phone calls are simply canceled and the iPhone stops responding. I really love it but that annoys me so much. You spend so much money and then something like that. Even reset network settings did not work. I'm really sorry :(
8334	iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Gray	Brian Weiler	4	Super smartphone, little freedom.	2017-08-28	de	The Iphone 6s is top. I've been a loyal Windows Mobile user for years. 3rd year, to be exact. However, I dared to switch to IOS 7 months ago. And what can I say: I regret it 50%. The display size is perfect for me with 4.7 inches! The display itself is just awesome. Rich colors, good contrast, super brightness, brilliant viewing angles. The cameras on both sides are also more than good. Sharp, colourfast & dynamic. Here then, nothing to complain about. As far as the performance is concerned, everything is pretty great here. Performant and reliable. The 2GB of RAM are gold value here. Feels 20. Apps open and the phone is still smooth and clean. The Achilles tendon of the iPhone was and is the lousy battery here too. In casual use, you will be able to get through the day without any problems - nevertheless, the mobile phone has to be charged every night. With intensive use, you have to load it even twice a day. That hurts. As for the hardware, the Iphone 6s is appealing. It looks good, is light and feels great in the hand. However, it is quite slippery and can therefore easily fall out of your hands. Here a shell is strongly recommended. My biggest criticism, however, is the limited freedom in terms of the OS. Apart from the background pictures nothing is customizable here. Mann has no way to download files from the Internet, such as ringtones, music, videos, emulators, etc. For a former, Proud Windows Mobile users like me that's pure AIDS. However, if you're a mainstream user who has no relevance to freedoms, you can access them here. If the money is worth it and can come to grate with Apple's philosophy, (I can not) the Iphone 6s is highly recommended.
8335	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Haris Sacevic	5	Typically Apple, expensive but damn good	2017-08-07	de	The iPhone 6s is an excellent smartphone. It is well known that the smartphone has a simple operating system and is very easy to use. In any case, I would recommend a case, because the phone on the back is very smooth and therefore can quickly slip off (out of hand, inclined surfaces). Also should Watch out for the camera as it protrudes a bit and can easily be scratched. I have been using the iPhone for a year now and am still fully satisfied.
8336	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	iC	5	Am thrilled.	2016-03-05	de	Use it as a computer replacement. Although the camera is not really well built and partly contradicts the otherwise fantastic feel, I can recommend it to any of the iOS and Apple. Price performance is Apple rather weak. But considering that this is no longer a mobile phone in the true sense, it can somehow be reconciled with the conscience. So I just want to suggest that who only wants a phone here is definitely wrong!
8337	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	petkamp	5	iPhone remains iPhone	2016-01-20	de	Excellent goods at a very good price. There really is not really much to say. I am also thrilled with this, my 4th iPhone.

I must say, so far I have no problems with it (toitoitoi). Also the error with the battery - which haunts time and again through the media - I have not been able to determine.Top device!
8339	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	mapo	2	Many surprises	2017-07-28	de	I assumed to have acquired a new iphone from a German seller. It came a device with a power plug that does not fit German sockets. A German charger was separate. The device had a Spanish default and otherwise a rather "" wild "" basic configuration. A bill with VAT ID card was also not there, so that I can now draw no input tax, which makes the device by a whopping 19% more expensive. Dear Amazon, I trust as a customer actually that you protect me from such unpleasant surprises and list only sellers who either supply the goods, which I can expect or who clearly point out deviations in their description. We only kept the device because we needed immediate replacement because of theft, otherwise we would have sent it back. After all, the delivery took place within 24 hours.

Optics and condition of the device were without defects. However, the battery with 672 Counts is no longer the best. So you have to replace it. Too bad that this was not specified in the description. Scope of delivery was without original parts - or OVP. Hope the phone does not disappoint me completely and will last until I save my Iphone X together! So please always look carefully at which dealers you ordered.

8349	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	DerDirk	5	Change from the S6 edge	2016-02-18	de	I am very pleased with the iPhone 6s. Before the iP I had a Galaxy S6 edge, in itself not a bad device. But you can not compare the processing with the Apple.Beim the iP, I immediately had the latest IOS version available, as you know it at Apple. In contrast to Samsung in conjunction with a telecom branding. Here you wait partly months until the new version is available. As long as then vulnerabilities are open, and every hack is happy. The battery of the iP holds in my use about half a day longer than the S6 edge. There are certainly more points who are better or worse. But that would go beyond the scope. It's usually a religious war. I stay with Apple, because there is still something worth the phone after half a year. Greetings

8351	iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	Thomas	5	Elegant, fine and woho	2016-01-20	de	Like every year, I always have the newest iPhone. Whoever comes from the 6 Series will not notice a big change at first glance. For one thing, it was marginally heavier and thicker, on the other hand, the appearance has changed nothing compared to the previous year model. However, the 6s is much more future-proof. 2gb ram and 3d touch make the use of the device a dream. Back camera I can not see much difference compared to the 6er. The front camera, however, is high-resolution and equipped with a screen flash that is also really bright! Who has the 6 Series, should seriously consider whether the change is worthwhile. I would switch to a plus model.
8352	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Pseudonym	5	Super Smartphone IPhone 6s	2016-10-13	de	I've now switched from my iPhone 4 because it was quite slow and no more updates and so much gives up the ghost :) and now I switched to the iPhone 6s and must say it is really very good. The switch was super easy, iPhone ran on Pc, data and programs from the old restored and everything was the same. Until now, the iPhone is running super / battery is empty every two days with normal use! But that's something. The best I like the proximity sensor and the 3D toucht.Sowie the Hammer Camera and natural highlight the 4K camera! iOS 10.0.2 runs great there is nothing to moan. Once iPhone always iPhone!

8354	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Max Quellbrunn	5	iPhone 6s as a successor to the iPhone 5s	2015-12-23	de	To make my review here really useful, I write from my special experience as a former iPhone 5s user who now uses the iPhone 6s. I go into the advantages that the 6s has compared to the 5s, or in which areas you can see no difference or why a change is worthwhile or not worthwhile.Old model: iPhone 5s, 16 GBNew model: iPhone 6s, 64 GB ** Screen size or mobile size ** The iPhone 6s has a noticeably larger screen. I was really satisfied with the size of the 5s and did not change for that reason. Frankly, the first two weeks I've gotten used to the larger screen, but now (about 1.5 months) I would not switch back. If I now have a 5s in the hand, it feels not only strange but too small. Although the size was not a change reason, I would now synonymous therefore to change. ** Touchscreen ** The iPhone 6s offers with the pressure-sensitive touch screen, a kind of right-click, in the additional options of certain apps are activated. Most standard apps already offer the option, of the other 50 apps I've installed, there are about 10 of this feature, with only about half really useful. I barely use that, so I do not see a change reason here. ** Speed ​​** I can make that short: The iPhone 5s was always super fast and I had no problems with it. Even after 2 years in continuous use, there was no reason to moan. There are no noticeable differences between 5s and 6s. ** Battery life ** Again, there is no difference. Due to the larger screen, I feel that I have to load the 6s a little more often. ** Camera or Photos / Videos ** I had hoped when switching from iPhone 5s to 6s, to get even sharper and more beautiful photos. And that hope was fulfilled. The photos at the 5s were great, now they are fantastic. An absolute reason to change, for those who want beautiful photos. Especially the front camera for selfies provides much better pictures. ** Memory ** I chose the 64 GB variant for the new iPhone 6s, because I was constantly struggling with memory problems with the 5s (16GB). I had to delete apps, photos or videos. That should not happen to me so fast now. ** CONCLUSION ** The change from iPhone 5s to iPhone 6s makes sense. Nicer photos, a better display and some new features that may be better used in the future (for example, I would be happy if the pressure-sensitive screen were used in games). If you change you should definitely go for the 64 GB version, also because the apps are getting bigger and the photos / videos need more memory due to the better quality. Thanks for reading and hopefully a lot of fun with the iPhone 6s.
8355	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gold	Laura Bielemeier	5	High quality mobile phone	2016-02-09	de	After my iPhone 4s was stolen, I first switched to a samsung device and was super dissatisfied. After 2 years there was also his spirit. Finally an iphone again. The quality starts with the packaging. Super chic and noble. The included headphones have a wonderful sound quality and look very high quality. The device itself is good in the hand and I like the design her great. The size is perfect and you can manage well with one hand. Of the "" inner values ​​"" I do not have the biggest idea. The images are crisp, processes run off quickly, so far nothing has crashed, the thing with the 3d touch works flawlessly (samsung the largest mist), the touchscreen is very sensitive and the sound quality when talking is outstanding. In my opinion, then great phone. The price is of course very high, but quite honestly this device is pure quality.

8358	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Melanie K.	5	I love my little apple	2016-11-08	de	After 20 years, I switched to the Iphone 6s for the first time from Samsung (after the 1 year old Note 4 was broken). I'm thrilled. From the handling, the design and especially for the reason that the Iphone can be coupled with the Ipad and the Macbook easily. Basically, the combination of all Apple products and the resulting problem-free use is really great! Unfortunately, there are two shortcomings. The switch-off button is now defective after 6 weeks. But was picked up easily by Apple for repair. Went quickly and easily. At the Apple Hotline, I then learned that the device was not actually produced for Germany. Unfortunately, I do not know if this is a disadvantage: The Iphone was delivered in a wrong color. I ordered rose-gold and got it in gold. Was not a big topic for me, because I like both colors but should not be like that.

8361	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	964turbo	5	As a die-hard Android user very pleased with the device!	2016-08-29	de	As a user of Android for many years, I can only praise the iPhone so far! In practice, the iPhone 6s proves to be a very good phone with an excellent display, strong camera (not very important to me personally), consistently high speed and well-known innovative user interface. In my opinion, the 3D-Touch has practical use and still has potential, the same applies to a few other functions that already look very promising with the upcoming iOS 10 update. The design of the smartphone is mMn. also very successful and for my taste higher quality than most Android devices. Full score so!

8363	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Peter G.	2	Low battery	2017-01-19	de	Am transferring from Nokia Winphone to Iphone. I like Apple's many apps and billing the store. In addition the connection to my 2 Ipads. Data security also plays a role, but who knows ... I need a lot of the phone camera. This is clearly worse at Apple. At 35% battery charge and cold weather, the phone turns off after each photo. The 6S has to be loaded every day although I do not run any games, call or mile much. With Windowsphone the charge lasted 3 days.
8364	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gold	Robert	5	Top cell phone	2016-03-11	de	VorwaendFrom my personal perspective and usage requirements for such a smartphone, the review should offer those interested a small and hopefully helpful clue to the assessment. In the family we use privately and professionally devices from both the "" iOS / Apple World "" (here iPhone 5S, 6 and now 6s) - as well as from the "" Android world "" (Huawei P8, LG G4). I am not an advocate of a "faith struggle" "between the different" "worlds" ". From my point of view: both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. In the end, it's up to each one to decide which system suits better. In the review, I'd rather compare the iPhone 6s with the predecessors than with the models from the Android world. >>> For a better overview, a small table of contents: 1. First impression / form factor / haptics / processing. Neues.3. Operating System / Software Equipment / Scope of Delivery / UVP.4. Kritik.5. Fazit.1. First impression. With the iPhone 6s, Apple has been on a cycle since the release of the iPhone 3, following a major change in case design, followed by a year of consolidation, which is more about changing / improving internal values View, the iPhone has now reached the ideal size with the 4.7 inches. The 4 inches in the iPhone 5 and 5s with the felt very slim design are in comparison (have a 5s for comparison here) significantly kleiner.Eine one-hand operation (of course, depending on finger length and hand size) are still well possible. Should it ever be tight, there is a possibility here by double-tip on the touch ID sensor to move the display display down. This actually works very well. I must confess to use this feature not very often. The rounded and circumferential outer edge as well as the edge slightly rounded display ensure a (relatively) good grip of the device. It is handily good in the hand, but it is still very smooth. The display and the surrounding aluminum edge seem to merge into each other almost without a gap. The overall build quality makes a very good impression. the iPhone 6's nominally higher weight does not really stand out (143g versus 129g) and is mainly made up of an improved aluminum. The slightly thicker construction (7.1 mm versus 6.9 mm) to its predecessor is also not noticeable. The slightly thicker construction gives the device a bit more "stability" (keyword Bentgate). The slight but noticeable protruding camera lens bothers me a bit, because it bothers here the "" out of a cast "" - impression something. But it is designed accordingly so that you never get stuck.2. Neues.Ich would not bore the reader with mostly incomprehensible technical vocabulary, so only very briefly: in the interior was a new so-called A9 - a processor with approx. 1.8GHz clocking 3rd generation Cyclone built on 64 bit architecture. An improved graphics processor (Power GT7600), working with a 2 GB RAM (unlike the iPhone 6 for the first time), ensures smooth working and a perfect display of HD content and graphics-intensive games at all times with other providers from the "other world" once again a "" arms race "" concerning technical equipment, takes place. Apple remains moderate in this respect in the iPhone 6S and relies on evolutionary changes and ultimately on an optimized matching between hardware and software. The battery capacity was slightly reduced (1,715 mAh versus 1,809 mAh) and ensures a nominal comparably long running time.The standby time when not in use has remained identical to its predecessor. In addition to the installed acceleration, gyro sensor and compass, the new iPhone also has an air pressure sensor (barometric sensor). Conversions can thus also be used to determine altitude measurements. For various tracking, hiking and fitness apps, this is a real added benefit. The technical parameters of the front and rear camera have sometimes changed significantly. The back camera is now equipped with 12.2 MP (previously 8 MP); the front camera with 5 MP (previously 1.2 MP). Videos in the highest resolution can now be recorded in 4K at 30fps (previously 1080p) .3D TouchAn innovation I was very excited about and which works very well is the so-called "3D Touch". A pressure-sensitive touch surface now allows different display results. In addition to the well-known multi-touch gestures such as typing, closing and closing, four-finger strokes, etc., there are now different degrees of pressure (Apple calls it "peek and pop"). Very good, I think that the iPhone a triggered 3D touch gesture on a very gentle and subtle vibration or similar. approved. I am so that I rarely intensively and often use the new gesture but still often explore a lot, where there would be a possible use. One will probably only have to get used to the new possibilities. To the Telefonierverhalten I can only say so much that this point works well. Receiving, listening and voice quality, I can describe as very good. Operating system / software / delivery / UVP.Werkseitig of course, the new operating system iOS 9.1 preinstalled.The scope of supply includes, as with its predecessors, the headphones (EarPods with remote control and microphone), the Lightning to USB cable and the 5W USB Power Adapter.The MSRP price of the 64GB variant is 849 Euro (iPhone 6 799 Euro). There are the iPhone still in the memory versions 16 GB (739 euro) and 128 GB (RRP 959 euro) as well as in each case in the colors silver, gold, space gray and rose gold. Criticism Apple's strategy is and will continue to be to integrate and merge devices within the "ecosystem" (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, etc.) as much as possible. Outside the own ecosystem, the devices and software are sealed off. The reasons for this strategy may be very diverse: profit maximization, security reasons, the user experience only to the pure application. This can, depending on the user's claim, of course, but also have disadvantages. Some narrowed uses and restrictions Apple, I see critically (as an example: why is the Lightning SD card adapter only for the iPad and not for the iPhone). If you discover after buying an iPhone that you can not expand the devices via microSD storage or it is just not identified by a notebook as a hard drive, has previously simply not sufficiently informed. Sure, there are some ways to get around the restrictions. What I recommend: Potential users should try to get enough information about the pros and cons (regardless of the emotionally charged brand image of the opposing worlds). Starting with your own usage claim, you should take the devices once in your hands, test them and consider: - what your personal average usage might look like - what data, photos or music I would like to have on the device - how could the cooperation with my remaining technical Equipment look like, etc. From this everybody has a basis on which one can decide. Finally, the devices are not cheap. By the way, when you buy new equipment, think about the high resale value.5. ConclusionFrom my point of view, the iPhone 6s has a very good smartphone in a (compared to its predecessor) almost the same design. The iPhone 6s is designed for trouble-free use without much "adjustment". This is achieved through a coordinated symbiosis of hardware and software. Be aware of limitations in connectivity and expandability in advance. Starting from the use claims, the iPhone for many a perfect companion in everyday life sein.Ich hope the review was for the one or the other for the decision for or against something helpful.

8367	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Jan Kremer	4	Good hardware at (un) fair price	2016-03-20	de	From the point of view of an Android user, who bought this device for the uncle, I can say that it is certainly a very good device with a good Apple ecosystem. I just do not understand why Apple always makes its smartphones pay so well. There are comparable alternatives from the Android camp ... but well, the tastes are different :)
8368	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	meine_Güter	3	Von Android zu iOS - it's about the Updates!	2017-06-09	de	Actually, I would have had no reason to make a system change, because I had made friends with Sony's Android well. The system ran stable, was very customizable and clear. In addition, an Android user also has access to the depths of the system, e.g. the file system or update settings of each individual app. Even system menus are configurable (the pull-down menu via swipe gesture from top to bottom for quick access to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, location, LTE / mobile data, etc.) Three things made me headache in the course of pending new acquisition and brought me to Apple: 1. missing updates, 2. missing updates and 3. those stupid oversizes of 5 "" and more on "" ordinary "" devices. The switchover was something, say .. bumpy: no more widgets, worse word suggestions when typing text, almost similarly configured as Windoof, unusable notifications in the pull-down menu, little system information, no access to the file system, selection of Bluetooth connections only through the system settings (in A. also via the pull-down menu), the AppStore is my opinion in comparison to Google Play grottenschlecht and confusing ...... Absolutely incomprehensible, but why I need to adjust the ringtone volume / vibration alert / mute cumbersome in the settings. Have the Apple people never had an Android in their hands? Over time, I've come to terms with iOS, but I'm not really happy with it. Well, the interaction between the apps and the whole system is better solved, but I actually want more usability v.a. through user-specific configuration and faster access to frequently used settings. That does not offer Apple so far. But the arrangement of the navigation icons is really unfortunate: "" back button "" top left is just not, even if you can bring the field within reach for the thumb with double-tap; this is just a workaround and not a solution! One thing hurts me too much: iOS is completely incompatible with Linux on the PC! I need to upload photos to disk via iCloud.com. Again an avoidable workaround; I do not understand why Apple offers the connectivity to Windoof and not to Linux, where many Linux are soooo much better and MacOS itself is a Unix-based system! Of course, there is nothing wrong with the quality and performance of the devices Haptics, sound, display, response and speed, radio interfaces, camera or whatever. It runs! Great also: advertising of apps is not placed so annoyingly prominently by the rather strict guidelines of Apple as with Android. My conclusion: Hardware very well, the software is not really my friend.It is but v.a. a security issue that regular system updates come (where "" regular "" is also relative ... so happens only once a year!); I can still do without new functions, they are nice to have. I'll wait until the Google Pixel has matured.Edit 2017-06-16: I read that the Google Pixel is only supplied to OCT 2018 with new Android versions and by the end of 2019 with security updates. Muhahaaa, that's about to break. Android can be recommended in no case! Just a reminder: the Google Pixel costs 32GB with a whopping € 700 and only came in October 2016 on the market. Then clearly prefer iOS and Apple and hope that because usability moderately for ambitious users still something happens. Update 2017 -10-29 iOS 11 came out and the Google Pixel 2 as well. From the former I had expected a bit more usability and from the second better quality and longer software maintenance. There's only limited usability on iOS 11, and there are some incomprehensible decisions that are very annoying in everyday life - e. G. the new, extended menu does not allow a proper deactivation of the wireless connections, the currently running connections are only disconnected. In order to deactivate WLAN and Bluetooth correctly one has to again cumbersome in the attitudes ...: / Generally the release notes of Apple are a joke ... I mean there are hundreds or thousands of the world's best developers, designers and product managers on it and then there are such things as new emojis as an absolute killer feature for a new version! That's silly. OK, in between are sometimes right developments, such as a new file system or a new App Store, but it has relatively little in daily use. The new pixel is now maintained longer and that's really a good decision from Google! However, some users report display errors (so-called burn-in), especially in the case of the Pixel 2 XL, but this could not be reproduced in the TechStage lab. I think that my next one will probably become a pixel, because Google plays monthly, not just annually, new patches. I am also curious what will become of the Sailfish project ... this is also a very interesting story.
8369	iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	Werner	5	Apple iPhone 6S	2016-10-03	de	I like it very much but that's a matter of taste, everyone has to decide for themselves or not ok.
8370	iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	Reiner Arp	5	Satisfaction with the iPhon	2016-03-12	de	Am very satisfied with the new IPhone 6s, keeps what was promised. Works very well together with the iPad Air.
8371	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Bweezy	5	From the appearance like the predecessor, under the hood, however, some changes ...	2015-12-03	de	The iPhone 6s from Apple comes with a Lightning cable, user manuals and the white headphones securely packaged. What has changed between the 6 Series and the 6s model and how does the flagship of Apple compared to the competition? On September, the iPhone 6s with 16GB, 64GB and 128GB capacities will be sold and days later it has broken its previous sales figures. Something must make Apple right, because evil tongues claim that only "iDiots" "such overpriced devices kaufen.Das iPhone 6s has a much stronger case than the iPhone 6, so that they can not bend ;-) Apple is here on a hard aluminum-zinc alloy (7000er aluminum) instead of the former aluminum-magnesium alloy (6000 aluminum) - a renewed Bendgate scandal thus impossible. That and the 3D touch technology make the 6s a little heavier and thicker than its predecessor. By 0.1-0.2mm grows the case and weighs just under 15 grams more. Barely noticeable.Value, elegance and workmanship, I do not really have to start. In my opinion, the most beautiful smartphone on the market - seamless transitions from curved glass to the frame, scratch-resistant and noble aluminum back and great workmanship of all housing openings and switches. The resolution remains unchanged at 1334x750 pixels with a display size of 4.7 inches, which corresponds to 326ppi. Apple renounces consciously the UHD trend with 500ppi +, because even so it is enough for an ultra-sharp representation. The contrast is 1400: 1, the Candela value with 550 is identical to the 6 model. The display quality is outstanding from every angle, even in extremely bright lighting conditions very well. However, under the touch field, a lot has happened. The iPhone 6s comes with a 64-bit A9 processor, which should be 70% faster than the "old" A8 processor from the 6 and 6+. The graphics performance should even have increased by 90%. In addition, the RAM has been doubled to 2GB. The "third" processor in the heart of the iPhone 6s relieves the two main processors and takes care of "low-energy tasks" such as fitness data or Siri. This spares the smaller battery. "But other smartphones have 4GB of RAM." "That's true, but iPhones need significantly less RAM than the quad-core devices with Android, as they are very efficient with the memory and unused apps virtually" freeze "." Really noticeable The new processor is not - of course, apps start faster, everything runs smoother and softer than ever. The battery has been reduced from 1810mAh to 1715mAh, even the stronger processor needs more "juice" than the A8. However, this is barely noticeable - a reduction of about 30min to 1 hour on the standby during intensive use.Maybe a bit sad, but somewhere the stronger processor and the 3D display must be accommodated. Impressive is how Apple's engineers manage to maximize the battery life and almost on the level of the iPhone 6 with almost twice as strong processor and smaller battery capacity. You can easily get through the day with the battery, with me it is even enough for 1, 5 days of intensive use, ie: WhatsApp, emails with Push, Facebook, Safari, etc.In the competition also significantly higher battery capacity is set, for example, the Samsung S6 Edge has 2550mAh. The revolutionary change in the 6s is the 3D touch. A cool feature, which is not compatible with every app at the moment. The display notices with what intensity you press on it. Peek & pop is the keyword. If you press a little harder on an SMS, you get a small preview without opening it. If you press it down again, the complete SMS will be displayed. An example. On the homescreen that works too - if you now press a little harder on the camera app, you can directly select whether you want to take a video, a photo or a selfie. The camera of the iPhone 6s shoots very good photos and takes synonymous Videos in 4k (30fps) and 1080p (up to 60fps) on! Slow motion videos are possible in 1080p (120fps) and 720p (240fps). The selfie camera has been significantly improved, there is also the screen brightness acts as a flash. The Touch ID feels even better. Lightning fast, the home screen opens after a short press on the home button and scans within a few milliseconds the finger. Apple offers the 16GB version for € 739, the 64GB for € 849 and the 128GB version for € 959. I prefer the 64GB version because I often shoot videos and shoot pictures - making the 16GB completely useless, as a one-minute 4k video can take up to 500Mb === For me, really one of the best smartphones currently and yes I have Tested Android smartphones. Valuable, elegant and sturdy case, a powerful A9 processor with more memory, a revolutionary 3D touch display and the two cameras were both significantly improved. The battery capacity is a little weaker on the paper, I hardly notice anything. The only drawback is here as always: The very high PRICE, especially if you prefer more memory. If you can overlook it, I can get the latest smartphone from Apple just recommend. If you already have the iPhone 6, I would wait at least a year, because in my eyes a change is not worthwhile.
8372	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Michael Schubert	5	iPhone SE	2016-10-21	de	Delivery and sales process flawless. You do not need to say much about the iPhone, it's just an iPhone with the usual reliability and performance.
8373	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	GC	2	Quality no longer what Apple produced earlier	2016-08-27	de	Unfortunately, I was struggling with weak LTE Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections. In addition, my interlocutors complained about a bad call quality. I have been an Apple customer since 1990 and have owned all iPhone models. Since the 6 Series and SE Series, I do not find the quality, what to expect from such an expensive product. The 6s and also the iPhone SE, which I had shortly before were both inferior. Luckily, you can return the device to Amazon within 30 days.
8374	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	Amazon Kunde	5	Very satisfied	2016-05-24	de	I ordered the iPhone 6s on Amazon for a long time. At first I was very skeptical, because it is a lot of money. However, the smartphone has been with me in Austria within 3 days. Original packed by Apple. It's been 2 months since then and I'm very happy with it. Would order it again immediately. LG Sarah
8375	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Eagle	5	Does the iPhone 6s have a better price / quality ratio?	2016-12-12	de	Does the iPhone 6s have a better price-performance ratio? "" - This question I asked myself when buying a new iPhone. In this review, I would like to answer for whom this question with "" YES "" answer. The most important Features that differentiate the iPhone 7 from the 6s: - Insulation against spray water - better camera (especially the optical image stabilizer [OIS] is an advantage here) - Headphone jack falls away (for me a clear negative point and would be problematic in my use, because I would need an adapter) - stereo speakers (in which case the lower speaker has a better quality & "" from below "" comes and the upper behind the speaker grille on the front or is mainly made for the phone speaker strictly speaking, one can question the term "stereo speakers" here because they are not equivalent) - other color variants (if that's good, everyone has to decide for themselves) - e twas stronger performance (in terms of processor and interconnect technologies; It should be noted that the difference between 6 and 6s is significantly larger than when comparing 6s vs. 7) - the battery life is better (probably the biggest plus point of the iPhone 7 [7: 1960 mAh, 6: 1715 mAh]), about 2 hours depending on the usage it is longer than the 6s; During the day, but with moderate use synonymous with the 6s is quite good - the iPhone 7 receives a little longer software updates than the 6s should be considered when buying 759 € iPhone 7 32GB. 649 € iPhone 6s 32GB is still the juxtaposition of the 2 most important points (larger battery & better camera). the extra charge of € 110 and you should not forget the missing headphone jack on the iPhone 7 of course (if you, such as I use wired headphones daily, this criticism can be deleted with an adapter, however.) Once again as a reminder to the beginning asked question: "" Does the iPhone 6s have a better price-performance ratio? "" Answer: "" YES "", if one of the two last mentioned, most important distinguishing features are not very important and the headphone jack in everyday life should not be missing (although If an adapter solves the problem with the iPhone 7, there are even some where you can listen to music and charge the iPhone at the same time, but the more stable & reliable solution is a fixed jack connection).
8376	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Betty	5	As always top	2016-03-28	de	As always happy with the new Iphone. There are all sorts of new gadgets, running smoothly and having a very good camera. The new slow-motion feature is a lot of fun, just like the GIF images that are automatically created when you take a picture. The nitty-gritty thing that can still be developed is the animated backgrounds. You can only move them by holding your finger on the screen. It would be much better if the animations move on their own, as is the case with Android phones. Otherwise, I am as always enthusiastic about the Iphone.
8377	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Friedrich von Kymmel	3	Product defective after 15 months	2017-03-10	de	The iPhone 6s is a high quality product with a proud price. That it is broken after 15 months, is annoying, but can happen. That then the Amazon dealer refuses to repair the defect in the context of the 24-month warranty on the grounds: "" For legal reasons, we come in the 24 months warranty only for defects that are demonstrably already present at the time of purchase were "" from my customer's point of view an impudence.

8380	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	More10	4	An iPhone just ... or: Especially not so special.	2016-01-14	de	So first a few hints: 1. Yes, I like my (mind first) iPhone very much. No, I'm not an Android, Windows Phone or iOS fanboy, but I tested all the systems on various devices and device generations.3. Here I briefly describe my impressions from the point of view of a technology fan and Designers.Nun, it is so, if one is interested in technology and in particular for mobile devices, then one is usually faced with the choice of Android or iOS. Unfortunately, my experience has shown me that (at least in the times of the Lumia 930) Windows Phone is indeed a really nice (subjective) operating system, but that still suffers a bit from the app offering. That's why I leave it out in this review. It was for a while that if you wanted quality workmanship, a simple operating system and high-end technology, you could grab Apple's iPhone with confidence. If one was willing to pay for premium quality and premium prices. If you wanted a more open, adaptable operating system, with devices between "" Plastikbomer "" and "" very well-processed plastic bomber "", it was mostly for price reasons rather Androiden.Aller has done a lot in recent times: Premium Androids are now in the best condition and with high quality materials, such as aluminum and glass therefore. For this Android league also moves more and more in the direction of Apple. Apple itself counteracts this by demanding a bit more per new generation. Unfortunately, without any, meaningful justification. Because technically, Apple has almost missed the connection. "" Waaaas, ... what's the nonsense "", I already hear the Apple fans scream. Okay, an example: iPhone 6S vs Samsung Galaxy S6. Operating systems are a matter of taste, so I do not make a comparison. What speaks for Samsung: + slightly cheaper + larger battery + much sharper display + impressive hardwareWhat speaks for Apple: + 3D Touch (although sometimes already implemented on Android devices) + possibly (!) Slight higher quality feel + stable value +.., Oh yes, it's an iPhone As you may see in this short excerpt: Me as a techie it has not been easy to decide for the iPhone. I get here for a surcharge of around 200 € (compared to high-end Android phones), the smaller hardware and, what made it particularly difficult for me (after a LG G3 with a display resolution of 2560x1440px), a display that Resolutionstechnisch almost as embarrassing is (1334x750px to 4.7 ""). Yes, you can clearly see the difference to FullHD (or even higher). Without direct comparison, the display is usable. At least colors and angles are great. Why did I stay with the iPhone now? ... I guess that in this decision, the designer in me had the upper hand. For one can definitely not deny Apple namely that they (with the exception of a few minor mistakes) know how to create contemporary high quality design and presented. It just feels like a well designed premium product. And after a short trial, I realized that the biggest criticism, the tiny battery, is not causing me any problems. Personally, I come with some Whatsapp, occasionally checking emails, surfing every now and then, taking a few photos, good over the day and hanging the iPhone at 40-50% rest battery at night. So my final thoughts were: - Is this the iPhone technically the best you can buy right now? NO! - Is the iPhone too expensive for the performance? Definitely YES, totally overpriced! - Do I still want it and if so, why? Yes I want it. There is no logical explanation for why you want an iPhone. Either you have this need for the Apple Spirit or not. And in this case, it has caught me again ... Well, and who knows, maybe in the upcoming iPhone 7 then yes sometimes installed technology. Until then I love my iPhone anyway ... :)
8381	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	5	Super!	2017-01-07	de	Really a great phone! Especially the fingerprint sensor is very convincing! Many cool features! Only the battery leaves much to be desired ... otherwise perfect!
8382	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Amazon Kunde	5	Super!	2017-01-17	de	In my opinion, the phone is good for a lot and has great quality. Has everything a smartphone needs, the video quality is really great and the battery lasts all day without problems.3D touch, I also find a really good feature. The fingerprint scanner is super fast and works really well.
8383	iPhone 6S	32GB	Rose Gold	Chris Jaqueline Pasternak	3	You have to be lucky	2017-07-22	de	I had the device here for 580 € (including shipping) bought and had to send it back because the microphone did not work. The package was also slightly damaged when it arrived, so I think that the shipping is not so well handled. A few weeks later I have ordered again the same phone for 530 € (inclusive shipping) and then everything has is working. Was then but funny the same product only another provider. With the new phone, I am now completely satisfied and it was also 1.5 weeks faster than announced.
8384	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Ehrlich und Fair	5	Mega Robust Reliable and stable in value	2016-07-15	de	I would like to make an honest opinion regarding the iPhones. This goes to all those who are looking for a robust reliable smartphone and can do without settings and expansion Schnick Schnack. I have owned iPhones for years and am now completely satisfied with the 6S. The camera is great, software runs as usual clean and does not crash. It is high-quality processed and makes like its predecessors after years without grumbling his service. I use it every day and am not a man of the extremes on his phone watching falls pre-programmed. Since I have all my photos and important data on the phone, it is important to me that the device does not give up its ghost overnight. The predecessor iPhones were already washed at 60C and after a couple of dry days even these two have worked again. So it is really robust and can be sold even after two years for good money.
8385	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Alexander Winter	5	Solid, not spectacular, but not disappointing!	2017-12-20	de	The iPhone 6 was already flawless, sometimes viewed that the pictures in bad light were not the ultimate. So really bad "" flagship smartphones "" is not there since 2014/2015. The 6s has the right size in my eyes , runs without jerks and makes beautiful pictures. iOS is a round system and self-explanatory on all devices. My wife has a 7 plus. Apart from the homebutton, there is not really much new to it. The processor is faster only on the sheet, you do not get that in reality. I also had the 8 in the hand, which is not much spectacular, let alone, I would never mind to spend 900 ¬, although my 6s almost everything is just as good. I also use in parallel my Galaxy A5 (2017), which is also a good device. But that is now too exasperating. The 6s is super processed, the battery brings me through the day and I find nothing that I would complain about so casually. Used for a relatively narrow thaler and thus a real candidate when 7,8 & X are too expensive.
8386	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	K.Kohlhardt	5	Very happy with the smartphone	2017-08-09	de	I bought the iPhone 6s because I've been working for a long time with the now very outdated iPhone 4s. I bought it almost 3 years ago and have not had any negative experience yet. I'm happy every time I buy Apple products. Be it new, or used the iPhone 6s you get even for just under 250 ¬ and for this price you get a lot of mature technology. Would always buy new products from Apple.
8387	iPhone 6S	64GB	Gold	Mareike	5	Super	2016-04-21	de	For a long time I was Apple - "" Opponent "" and I refused to buy an iPhone because the price is quite high. At some point I discovered the iPhone 6s and fell in love immediately. The design is just great. Looked for a cheap version on Amazon and compared to Media Markt and Saturn really saved a lot of money. The iPhone arrived fairly quickly (faster than expected), the packaging was undamaged and sealed. I'm super happy with the phone and I'm not happy about it, as with Samsung, so many useless apps that you can not delete!
8388	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Crashbug	5	Top Product	2016-04-16	de	As a newcomer and longtime user of Android, I can only say that iOS is the much better OS. Any operation is again so easy that one does not get it first. And it is the same in all applications. Why I just did not switch earlier ???? The seller: BlackPrime has done everything properly.
8389	iPhone 6S	128GB	Space Gray	Pfeiffer	3	Fast smartphone, unfortunately very unreliable	2017-01-29	de	Basically, the phone does almost everything it should do. However, the iPhone has problems with a headset, even the original. It just happens regularly that I do not understand people and they do not understand me when I talk to them. Then it only helps a complete reboot, which makes the phone slower and more uncomfortable than any other smartphone. No idea how to afford such aberrations and still be so successful .... Well, otherwise I like the iPhone very much good and does what it should. It has very often and a lot of connection problems, but this can also be due to the telecom. I'd rather get the 6s needed today and be happy instead of throwing my money out the window and being annoyed.
8390	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Dieter D.	4	Usual Apple quality!	2016-04-15	de	Sure, you could praise the advantages in Himmer highly or point out the relationship to current android products at the point ... in addition there are enough contributions in relevant forums & comparison portals. Beautiful product, iOS works! 1 star deduction for: - currently no alternative to the credit card , Prepaid cards or O2 - contract settlement in iTunes- It's bigger than you think! : D
8391	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	LBM5	4	My first iPhone	2017-09-17	de	After using only Android in the past, but getting irritated on the other side and having been very satisfied with my iPad Air 2 so far, I once wanted to try out this infamous apple cell phone. The # 1 argument for an iPhone has always been "it just works", I can say that 95% agree. I've installed quite a few Custom ROMs on my Android smartphones to make them run faster and more stable. When I first had the iPhone 6s in my hand, I first noticed how damn fast it is, if the animations were even lower then it would just be there, press app and there it is. So you have an animation that I personally sometimes too long, but still very fast total. First impression: In addition to the fast system, the processing is great, too bad that the camera on the back something stands out, but a shell drum and you are the problem Come on. The size is just perfect in the hand, so I can touch comfortably with one hand, but also with both thumbs, it can fully embrace and still achieve everything on the display, usually without finger acrobatics. The iPhone 6s has at least a headphone connection, which I thought to use, I was wrong. Bluetooth headphones have made the connection useless. But let's come to something that just inspired me. The Camera: Unbelievable what shoot out of such a small lens for pictures. They are not oversaturated as in my Galaxy S7 before, but the quality is on the same level. It is impressively good for pictures on the move, even at dusk, it does quite well, even if the ISO is quickly raised, but the camera can do it. The front camera with its "display flash" ensures good selfies even in dark environments such as bars. The feature that really convinced me are live photos, in iOS 10 it may be a bauble for many, but people with iOS 11 are showing the potential! If the picture is shaky you can use live photos to edit the picture and choose a sharp one, especially when taking pictures of the enrollment currently this has been incredibly convenient, children are not so patient and so you get very nice pictures at the end with little effort. A history of the battery: iPhones were never notorious for a good battery life, on the contrary. This has improved since the Plus models, but the iPhone 6s is on the cliché side. My girlfriend took the rose gold mobile phone from my hand almost instantaneously and uses it myself. Early pulled by the loader with moderate to heavy use, she usually has 30% left in the evening.Means her a lot of WhatsApp, Browser, YouTube and listen to music here and there. However, she now has a battery around the device, which she is now completely satisfied with the device. For me it was faster empty, after 8-10 h use it wanted back to the charger, which then recharged it in 1.5 h approx. Due to the rather small 1715mAh battery it should withstand according to Apple 11h web browsing, sites like Chip.de came to 10: 04h and I can confirm that quite well. I used it with the iOS 11 Beta 3-9 and it pulls hard on the battery, so I could test the future features. With iOs 10.3.3, it has reached the specified 10-11 h, now with the Golden Master of iOs 11, the runtime is at the same level. Other: TouchID is incredibly fast and extremely practical, I do not want to miss it anymore. The mute button is so simple and intuitive that I learned to love it. It is a pity that you can not transfer Android WhatsApp backups to iOS. iOS itself is very strict, you can not personalize everything and the home screen is not quite as I wanted it, more icons in the dock would be nice, widgets I do not miss here, because the info display on the left works very well for me and the Notifications, Android is just better. Although ForceTouch has already improved a lot here and I use it in hindsight much more than Thought, especially for photos and web links in my e-mails. CONCLUSION: If the battery life better, I would recommend it immediately. My "iPhone-only" girlfriend loves it naturally and has nothing to complain about, but for me it's little things and maybe I'll test a plus model in the future and maybe there is the battery life to my satisfaction. Complement: Now I have the plus model and I'm very happy with it, but I've also bought a battery and with 330g everything is not quite so easy, but otherwise I am very satisfied.

8393	iPhone 6S	16GB	Rose Gold	Amazon Kunde	5	Totally positively surprised	2016-05-01	de	I've been thinking longer whether I should buy the iPhone here on Amazon or in the trade, because I was afraid because of the price, it could be a Nachmache.Das iPhone came 2 days after I ordered it so completely normal, through Amazon certainly packed Originally it was packed and it is really an original Apple iPhone. I'm super happy with the phone and would not exchange it I can only recommend!
8394	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Wend-Wag	5	Samsung S3/S5 vs. Apple iPhone 6s	2017-08-06	de	Am after several years Android on Samsung S3 / S5 on the iPhone 6s switched. I have never regretted this change. Here are the pros and cons of the 6s: + The biggest advantage: the iPhone does not slow down or has more crashes with time. After a year at Samsung I always had the feeling that the phone is 10 years old. Ongoing crashes and a noticeable slowdown in the operating system. The apps and the operating system are running extremely stable at Apple. A crash of the phone I have never had and the apps max. once a month. + class design + super operating system, where it takes a little getting used to without back and menu button. I honestly miss the back button now and then, but the solutions are okay with Apple. + Setup and start is super fast, only one sign up at Apple (Samsung felt 100 accounts necessary to use all pre-installed apps) + Only the most necessary apps pre-installed (photo, calendar, etc.) + I've bought an iPad and the data transfer and setup was so ingeniously simple and well linked, but a huge plus + Camera, TouchID, 3D Touch .....- The only major disadvantages for me is the weak battery. However, a day is good in it and synonymous with Samsung I had to always load in the evening, as well as this battery no complete. 2days stops
8395	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Sparschwein	4	Apple iPhone = finally satisfied	2016-02-22	de	After having 2 years of Android devices after my iPhone 5 (with which I was absolutely dissatisfied due to the vulnerability of the anodized housing), I am glad to be back on the iPhone. Last year I have 3 top smartphones of the Koreans and Chinese bought and had only annoyance (from the camera, over the listener loudspeakers up to the manufacturer THREE times unresolved USB problems). The money, which I at these times "" wanted to save "", I was allowed by sales with Loss and psychological stress (due to all the trouble) ausbaden.Ja, the apple is expensive and the battery is numerically relatively small. Compared I the iPhone 6s now with eg with one of the Koreans (only in trouble) then my iPhone 6s battery now holds much longer and consumed when not in use for 6 hours acceptable 3-5%, not 15-20%! Thanks Apple, I'm satisfied again. I hope so, too.
8396	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Gandalf	4	Everything great	2016-08-13	de	I use the Habdy now since the release date and I'm very happy with it. (64 GB variant) The phone is stable and makes absolutely no problems. It just does what it should and does. Camera is synonymous top and it has never let me down. The people who give a star here because of iOS, please just stay with their Android and is good. The star deduction is there for the unfortunately too small battery and that where I used it without a shell, immediately there was a scratch in it ,
8397	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	ALH	1	Unfortunately nothing ... Ghost Touch problem	2016-10-31	de	The delivered device had the so-called "Ghost Touch" problem. This means that after unpacking and first attempting to set up the smartphone, it automatically performed entries. It automatically entered letters, which made it impossible to set up the smartphone correctly. When trying to enter the e-mail address were constantly inserted five or 25 new letters. The device then went back unfortunately. However, praise to the seller for the quick reimbursement of the amount and easy return.
8398	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Anonymiker	4	Lots of light - a little shade	2015-12-30	de	As a longtime Apple user, I would like to break no lance for or against Apple products, but especially on the improvements or deteriorations - compared to my previous device the iPhone 5 - go in: The strongest contrast is first in the larger phone - and the larger screen. One of my big worries was that fact: would the cell phone not be too big for me? ... I've heard from some people traveling around that they wanted to have their old device back at once. For me, exactly the opposite effect occurred: I had already grown in size after 5 minutes, that I was seriously considering whether the iPhone 6S + would not have been even better. Only rarely do you get to a corner not as well off as in the past - but what you gain for additional vision makes up for the 10x. Here's a very big PLUS. The next big thing is the fingerprint scanner. Of course all those who have an iPhone 5S or newer already know that - but for me it was a big news. Unfortunately, it is not quite mature yet. I used to work classically with the message center. Say: the first push of a button showed me the time - with the second wipe I was in the message center. Today I can hardly avoid that I am automatically logged on ... and (and then you realize then that the phone has got bigger) to wipe from top to bottom, you have to stretch his hand already uncomfortable. In addition - and this is also a small disadvantage - I need now longer to get into the camera mode, because always only the registration takes place. Thus I miss the one or the other nice snapshot :-( But - and I find that considerable - the iPhone 6S keeps longer with the battery than my iPhone 5 although it has a larger display, many more sensors and also constantly scanning my fingerprint .Eas ugly I think the on / off button to the side to lay in. Sure - you get better off ... BUT: if you want to take a screenshot (and I do that more often) then you get very often in parallel to the volume buttons - and that prevents the screenshot.Last small defect - of which I do not know if it is only on my device or at all: the sockets for the charging cable and the headphones are a bit sharp Sensitive as far as my fingers are concerned - but I'm used to something else from Apple in this regard, and I suspect that it's because all the edges on the iPhone 6S are rounded - this keeps the fingers from touching If I find that this "" error "" only on my device is present, I will add this here.
8399	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Michael M.	3	Good, but not good enough for the price	2016-05-10	de	I've been using smartphones for a good 6 years, but so far all Android devices. For Apple products, the price has always deterred me. Now my wife (6S-plus) and I (6S) wanted to switch to the other side and try it with iPhones of the current generation, even if that is financially a house number. I would call myself a tech savvy and I had also no fear of contact with iOS. I use smartphones only to make calls, scheduling and mail traffic (business & private), navigation, whatsapp and for the Internet (shopping, price comparisons, etc.). Games I have no installed. Positive I found: - Good workmanship, although not better than Samsung S7 or similar, that the markup to the Android competition would be justified. Above all, the above camera lens and the two antenna bands on the back interfere with the otherwise successful optics Fast Wlan (I found despite the same settings and frequencies a little faster than with my other devices) - reliable fingerprint sensor- Good display, sufficiently bright and sharp- Good camera, but I would not take any pictures if the picture / event is important to me. For correct photos I take a digital SLR and no HandyWas me to the return of both devices has moved the following points are: - no "" email push "" of GMX possible. Despite the IMAP account, it is not possible to receive e-mails immediately. Mails are only retrieved and displayed when you open the mail app. Tested with the onboard mail app and typemail. Seems to be lying on iOS, as I unfortunately have learned too late from Apple forums - rotation of the homescreen at 6S not possible (eg in car holder, where I had installed it transversely) - charging takes a relatively long time (> 2h) - very cumbersome procedure, if you just want to copy a few mp3 files to the device. iTunes must be installed on PC. Setting an mp3 file as a ringtone is possible, but again only with iTunes and also very cumbersome selection of apps is lower and usually. These are more expensive than on Android. Ok, the extra cost you can get over, missing apps unfortunately not.- without rubber protective cover, the device is very "" slippery "". I'm always worried that it's slipping out of my hand. With cover, the nice look is of course flute again, at least I found it despite transparent Bumpercase not really pretty. Sure, the negative aspects of one or the other is not so important and I would probably have to know some things before. But what can not be for a business device with allegedly progressive iOS, is the problem with the retrieval of Mails.For Apple Fanboys but certainly a nice device and worth the money.
8400	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	kahebo	4	Review of the iPhone 6s	2015-12-01	de	VorwaendFrom my personal perspective and usage requirements for such a smartphone, the review should offer those interested a small and hopefully helpful clue to the assessment. In the family we use privately and professionally devices from both the "" iOS / Apple World "" (here iPhone 5S, 6 and now 6s) - as well as from the "" Android world "" (Huawei P8, LG G4). I am not an advocate of a "faith struggle" "between the different" "worlds" ". From my point of view: both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. In the end, it's up to each one to decide which system suits better. In the review, I'd rather compare the iPhone 6s with the predecessors than with the models from the Android world. >>> For a better overview, a small table of contents: 1. First impression / form factor / haptics / processing. Neues.3. Operating System / Software Equipment / Scope of Delivery / UVP.4. Kritik.5. Fazit.1. First impression. With the iPhone 6s, Apple has been on a cycle since the release of the iPhone 3, following a major change in case design, followed by a year of consolidation, which is more about changing / improving internal values View, the iPhone has now reached the ideal size with the 4.7 inches. The 4 inches in the iPhone 5 and 5s with the felt very slim design are in comparison (have a 5s for comparison here) significantly kleiner.Eine one-hand operation (of course, depending on finger length and hand size) are still well possible. Should it ever be tight, there is a possibility here by double-tip on the touch ID sensor to move the display display down. This actually works very well. I must confess to use this feature not very often. The rounded and circumferential outer edge as well as the edge slightly rounded display ensure a (relatively) good grip of the device. It is handily good in the hand, but it is still very smooth. The display and the surrounding aluminum edge seem to merge into each other almost without a gap. The overall build quality makes a very good impression. the iPhone 6's nominally higher weight does not really stand out (143g versus 129g) and is mainly made up of an improved aluminum. The slightly thicker construction (7.1 mm versus 6.9 mm) to its predecessor is also not noticeable. The slightly thicker construction gives the device again a little more 'stability' (keyword Bentgate). The slight but noticeable protruding camera lens bothers me a bit, because it bothers here the "" out of a cast "" - impression something. But it is designed accordingly so that you never get stuck.2. Neues.Ich would not bore the reader with mostly incomprehensible technical vocabulary, so only very briefly: in the interior was a new so-called A9 - a processor with approx. 1.8GHz clocking 3rd generation Cyclone built on 64 bit architecture. An improved graphics processor (Power GT7600), working with a 2 GB RAM (unlike the iPhone 6 for the first time), ensures smooth working and a perfect display of HD content and graphics-intensive games at all times with other providers from the 'other world' once again an "arms race" "concerning technical equipment, takes place. Apple remains moderate in this respect in the iPhone 6S and relies on evolutionary changes and ultimately on an optimized matching between hardware and software. The battery capacity was slightly reduced (1,715 mAh versus 1,809 mAh) and ensures a nominal comparably long running time.The standby time when not in use has remained identical to its predecessor. In addition to the installed acceleration, gyro sensor and compass, the new iPhone also has an air pressure sensor (barometric sensor). Conversions can thus also be used to determine altitude measurements. For various tracking, hiking and fitness apps, this is a real added benefit. The technical parameters of the front and rear camera have sometimes changed significantly. The back camera is now equipped with 12.2 MP (previously 8 MP); the front camera with 5 MP (previously 1.2 MP). Videos in the highest resolution can now be recorded in 4K at 30 fps (previously 1080p) .3D TouchAn innovation I was very excited about and which works very well is the so-called '3D Touch'. A pressure-sensitive touch surface now allows different display results. In addition to the familiar multi-touch gestures such as typing, closing and closing, four-finger strokes, etc., there are now different levels of pressure (Apple calls it 'Peek and Pop'). Very good, I think that the iPhone a triggered 3D touch gesture on a very gentle and subtle vibration or similar. approved. I am so that I rarely intensively and often use the new gesture but still often explore a lot, where there would be a possible use. One will probably only have to get used to the new possibilities. To the Telefonierverhalten I can only say so much that this point works well. Receiving, listening and voice quality, I can describe as very good. Operating system / software / delivery / UVP.Werkseitig of course, the new operating system iOS 9.1 preinstalled.The scope of supply includes, as with its predecessors, the headphones (EarPods with remote control and microphone), the Lightning to USB cable and the 5W USB Power Adapter.For the transfer of data, photos and videos, by the way, I can recommend the following MFI (Made for iPhone) certified article: "" HooToo Lightning USB Stick 32GB Flash Drive with USB 3.0 for iPhone and iPad "" The MSRP price of the 64GB version is 849 euros (iPhone 6 799 euros). There are the iPhone still in the memory versions 16 GB (739 euro) and 128 GB (RRP 959 euro) as well as in each case in the colors silver, gold, space gray and rose gold. Criticism Apple's strategy is and will continue to be to integrate and merge devices within the "ecosystem" (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, etc.) as much as possible. Outside the own ecosystem, the devices and software are sealed off. The reasons for this strategy may be very diverse: profit maximization, security reasons, the user experience only to the pure application. This can, depending on the user's claim, of course, but also have disadvantages. Who after the purchase of an iPhone determines that you can not expand the devices by microSD memory or it is just not identified by a notebook as a hard drive, has previously been simple not sufficiently informed. Sure, there are some ways to get around the restrictions. What I recommend: Potential users should try to get enough information about the pros and cons (regardless of the emotionally charged brand image of the opposing worlds). Starting with your own usage claim, you should take the devices once in your hands, test them and consider: - what your personal average usage might look like - what data, photos or music I would like to have on the device - how could the cooperation with my remaining technical Equipment look like, etc. From this everybody has a basis on which one can decide. Finally, the devices are not cheap. By the way, when you buy new equipment, think about the high resale value.5. ConclusionFrom my point of view, the iPhone 6s has a very good smartphone in a (compared to its predecessor) almost the same design. The iPhone 6s is designed for trouble-free use without much "adjustment". This is achieved through a coordinated symbiosis of hardware and software. Be aware of limitations in connectivity and expandability in advance. Starting from the use claims, the iPhone for many a perfect companion in everyday life sein.Ich hope the review was for the one or the other for the decision for or against something helpful.

8402	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Jenny	5	great mobile phone	2016-01-16	de	Once Apple - always Apple. ;-) The size of the smartphone is initially getting used to, of course. However, streaming on the screen at the size is clearly more enjoyable than at 4.7 "" and smaller! Anyone who does a lot online on the iPhone will appreciate the size. The usual very good feel and the wonderful resolution speak for themselves again! :-) The color (rosé-gold) for women (next to the golden version) is beautiful to look at. The improved resolution of the front and rear camera is great! The pictures are very good quality. Thumbs up for that! Tip: a bulletproof glass as a screen protector is a must for the (unfortunately) vulnerable displays. Can be obtained super cheap on the Internet, as prices in the shops are frequently overpriced. Who wants to have no scratches on the back of the good smartphone, which is a shell to heart - also cheap to obtain via the Internet. :-) To iOS itself: the apps run as usual stable and with the help of the cloud, you can really secure everything necessary data (my last iPhone was recently stolen and I can lock and restore everything via the cloud!). The EUR 0.99 for the cloud (from 5GB it costs something) is highly recommended to any user! Conclusion: Apple is still moving in the higher-priced segment with its products. For these products, however, the very good workmanship, the coordinated software and the sheer endless variety of good apps and accessories always speak in favor! Quiet access! :-)
8403	iPhone 6S	16GB	Gold	anita m.	5	Top!	2015-12-19	de	I bought the iPhone 6S at LivingTronics on Amazon and it arrived after 5 days at my home, still sealed.
8404	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	M.B.	4	Without alternative. And yet at least 1 star deduction	2016-04-19	de	Who knows how in 2016 a smartphone in the overall concept must 'feel', also knows that you can not get past the Iphone. Overall concept is to feel, processing, performance and above all (!) One: The Software.You can buy the most expensive Aston Martin - without harmony of driver (software) and car (hardware) everything else does not matter.So synonymous with a smartphone. I've been there since the iPhone 5S (formerly a 3G, but iOS was still a complete catastrophe - then long Android - S3 / S4, LgG2, Nexus5) and would like to share my opinion and show why IMO is not Alternative is Excellent. But that's just what you expect from today's smartphones. Especially when made of metal.Haptic: Half star deduction. The 5S is still very good in the hand. The 6S is due to the large screen edge and because of the top and bottom of the large housing part, which stretches the device a bit unnecessarily not always perfect with one hand to operate. For a e.g. Woman with smaller hands I see there black. Other devices are the same here despite more inches (narrower edge of the screen) Battery: Again half a star deduction and also the point of definitely the most disturbing. At least with intensive use. I'll say it this way: I'm just about the day - but it also play one or the other times a Game.Software: iOS itself still has potential. You do not need to say anything about doubly bugs. That has every OS. I'm not so picky. That's what I'm about for touchscreen feedback; and here the Iphone continues to be absolutely unrivaled. Letters react "directly" and the screen stays immediately and without delay under the thumb. e.g. Images in gallery or websites in Safari. Who does not notice any difference to Samsung and Co. - do not know ... for me one of the reasons to stay with the Iphone. There are also FAR higher-quality apps and a tidy Appstore. When I look around the Playstore, it scares me. Contaminated apps everywhere. Especially as a hobby photographer is the iPhone - in terms of apps - actually mandatory. Memory With 16GB you have it. With 64GB you can use it correctly. With Spotify, 2-3 4k videos, some apps and games mostly almost 10GB frei.Fehlender memory card slot? Only useful as an extension of the internal memory, if the card is seen as internal memory (ie like a partition). However, this would slow the memory immensely -> cut me off. Accessories: Lightning is simply the best charging cable! (no matter how rum). I have never used Earpods. Can not possibly be better than reasonable InEars. However, I have never had any claims to enclosed headphones. Conclusion: Of course, the iPhone is not for every purse. Especially since you can pay for more memory again 100 € more. The prices of the competition, however, show that the Iphone is no longer the only capitalist. But I rather pay € 799 for uncompromising fast performance, qualitative apps in a simple, intuitive and secure OS without unnecessary innumerable features (S-view, SmartStay and what not all). But then you have Facetime & Imessage and very long support :-) LG

8408	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Raphael Kraus	5	Super mobile phone with future security	2016-08-02	de	As a prehistory I have to say that I'm a long-time Android user and I now next to my almost obsolete iPad Mini (still running super thanks to regular updates) have bought a brand new iPhone 6s niegel.-Size / DeviceThe device has with the Measures 138 * 67 * 7 mm (length * width * height) and a weight of 143 grams for the perfect dimensions and is great in the hand. It bothers me a bit that the camera on the back sticks out a bit, but I have anyway a silicone sleeve. Screen with a diagonal of 4.7 "" = 11.94 cm and the resolution of 1334 * 750 pixels (326 ppi ), the screen is sharp. It has the perfect size to be operated with one hand and is not too big as for example with a Samsung Galaxy Note.-PerformanceWith the latest A9 chip, Apple also puts on a super stak chip of the mobile in 3-5 Years still usable. This is also because the Apple as a zigster manufacturer even after years of updates for the devices brings out. As I said, the processor is very powerful and it can really all apps are operated, whether 4K video editing or 3D rendering. Camera The camera can record videos with a resolution of up to 3840 * 2160 pixels (ie 4K) and 30 FPS. It is possible to record slow motion videos with 120 FPS at a resolution of 1080p and 240 FPS with 720p. In addition, the camera has a 3x zoom. Of course, the camera can also take photos with 12 megapixels. Battery The battery will last a day without problems and can be brought from 20% within 2 hours back to 100%. I hope I could help with the purchase decision In addition, I would be pleased if I am Amazon Vine product tester and can still write reviews for many other smartphones and can help in the purchase decision.
8409	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Jennifer Schimanski	4	16 GB too little	2017-02-17	de	It's of course a great phone. But if you get an I Phone I assume that it uses often. So I also like downloading a lot, want to save games, photos and videos or other files. 16 GB is of course not soooooooo little but not soooooooo much storage space. And you should remember that you can use any additional memory card. But have fun with the I Phone, and you will have guaranteed.

8411	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Teresa Zech	5	Class!	2016-08-23	de	I have been an iPhone user for 3 years. I used to own the Samsung Galaxy s4 and it got broken pretty quickly. I have to say that it has fallen down to me - BUT on iPhones this does not seem to be a problem. My old iPhone 5s has had to endure a lot (falls to the ground and once in the toilet), however, it worked perfectly until I bought the iPhone 6s. I love slightly larger phones and the design I like the 6s very well. The display is large enough, the IOS system is generally very simple too I'm a huge fan of Apple, since I had to experience a lot with Samsung. I have now ordered a bulletproof film and this meets their purpose to 100%. My cell phone has fallen down as well, however It always has a shell around and the film and I have not a single scratch. The invented by Apple fingerprint works flawlessly, the battery lasts long enough (unless you play the S long piel 8pool;) The camera is great - for me, no other cell phone has such a good camera and the standard editing capabilities are completely aus.Fazit: The iPhone 6s is very user-friendly and is in the price-performance ratio very satisfactory! I love it
8412	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Der gestiefelte Kater	2	Very disappointed with the quality	2017-03-18	de	My review only relates to the durability / sustainability of this product. Today's products are generally subject to a planned obsolescence should be clear to everyone (which is why one morally committed to our environment would be sustainable / Fairtrade products to buy). However, one can expect a cell phone to last at least two years until the next contract extension without major failures. Already with my previous Iphone 5s the Lightning connector was broken shortly after one year and had to be replaced. At the present 6s he has endured almost 1.5 years until I had to have him repaired for 70 €. Now shortly thereafter, the ear speaker has failed. All this despite the fact that my phone has been well maintained / protected all along (bulletproof glass, sturdy case, normal usage, no crashes). Overall, this is just very annoying and a huge impudence. For me, Apple products are therefore no longer in question in the future.

8416	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Hishigi	2	The warranty does not take Apple so seriously!	2016-07-14	de	After 11 months, the device did not turn on. Already the next day it was picked up by DHL and brought to repair, so far as well - two days later came the news that the Iphone was bent (with a photo) and I have to pay 321 € for the repair. A deformation is not really visible on the photo and certainly not the reason for the error, which is why I have asked the support for a recall and made my objections. The employee told me that Apple always repairs ALL errors of a device and one (which? ?) Deformation is accidental damage, which is why the warranty is not given. No matter for what reason the repair order was issued!
8417	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	dot_ore	3	Every ... years again!	2015-10-10	de	Update: December 2016As it seems, my battery is also affected by the exchange action. As soon as it's fresh outside, the phone just goes off. The battery is then displayed as completely empty. I am outraged and move down to 3 stars! --- Just in time for the release, I received the iPhone 6S 16GB in space gray. I did not want to play Apple's product policy completely and decided on the smallest version. Actually an outrage to offer no 32 GB version or the ability to use external memory. Well, one would like to enter as much margin as possible at Apple. Nevertheless, this is about the entry-level model of the iPhone 6S. I previously had a 5S and sold it in advance. Therefore, my test, as usual, always refers to a comparison of the previous model S to the current S.The phone has a high quality and top processed. As you would expect from a premium product. Compared to the iPhone 6, it has also become a little heavier and in comparison to the 5S noticeably heavier in the hand. This is due to the new 7000 aluminum alloy that Apple now uses. Otherwise, it looks just like the iPhone 6, only on the back adorns a simple "" S "" the phone and conveys it is the drilled version of 6. It also comes with the latest iOS version 9.0, which supports options such as Force Touch. The display measures a diagonal of 4.7 inches and just fits in the hand. One-handed operation is getting difficult, but it is still just. Likewise it disappears easily in the trouser pocket, thanks to its thinness. Which is still relevant to me because I do not want to keep my phone in my hand or rubbing it under someone's nose. The cameras have been significantly improved. Now there is a front camera with 5 MP and lightning through the screen. This works really well and helps in very dark environments. However, I have to say that you have to keep absolutely still, so that the photos are rudimentary or even useful. Well, still no optical image stabilizer! The rear camera has been increased from 8 to 12 MP and makes solid, sometimes very good photos.However, she also has problems in low light and makes some coarse-grained, pixelated photos. The noise behavior is then correspondingly strong. Overall, it's a good leap forward and the selfies look a lot better now, with a very steady hand. Unfortunately, the pictures are bigger and with the limited memory of 16 GB, minus iOS and the pre-installed apps, just a good 9 GB are left. Since one should think each snapshot well or at best immediately pull on the calculator! But if you can make the compromise, it is bearable and you can provide accordingly. The battery life is similar to the 5S or 6. Depending on the intended use, one can assume that you have to charge the phone every day. In addition, Apple has built a smaller battery due to the display. Of course, this is also at the expense of capacity. Nevertheless, it is sufficient for my purposes: a few short phone calls a day, bissl Whatsapp & Instagram, check e-mails, the whole 3-4 times a day and I have to charge the phone every third day. In addition, you have the opportunity to go into power-saving mode at any time. This extends the battery life accordingly again. The new features of the iPhone 6S, to say the least, nice. The live photos are nothing more than movie clips, which are brought to life with the appropriate finger pressure. Just like the preview function of the various apps. I press firmly on the display, it vibrates and signals me so I can now browse my mails or check Instagram News. If I intensify the pressure, one stays directly in the respective app. That's all very amusing, but it's not really a new operating experience. In sum, everyone has to decide for themselves if they want to spend so much on a cell phone. I drive this policy for 6 years, but only because Apple phones are relatively stable in value and you get for his 2-year-old iPhone just under half of the original price. Otherwise, I would not pay at least € 739.- out of pocket. Nevertheless, I have to say that the value and especially the feel of the iPhone has always convinced me and I want to continue this "" luxury "" in some ways. In addition, it runs to date absolutely stable and had no dropouts. Thanks to the new A9 chips and 2 GB of RAM, the phone is damn fast and all apps run accordingly. Still the best choice for me at the moment!

Unfortunately, I just do not want to enumerate everything really, but why enumerate all the positive, if there is nothing negative?
8419	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Florian Hottenrott	5	The (so far) best iPhone	2016-04-25	de	It was probably not very surprising when Apple had announced the 6S, because we had become accustomed since the iPhone 4, that there would always be a successor before the next generation appeared. This kind of development can perhaps be described quite well as evolution, and the leap to a new number is then a revolution, because experience shows that the previous S-offshoots have always been the more perfected forms of their direct predecessors. Similarly, in my opinion, so too the iPhone 6S.Man had always criticized the 8 megapixel camera, which still made brilliant pictures despite the low MP count. After all, Samsung had already presented 16 megapixel cameras - interestingly, they rowed back in this regard - and let's not forget the camera smartphone from Nokia with its 43 megapixels. With the 6S has now for the first time 12 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front camera installed. A good development, in my opinion, on the quality of the images, however, does not change much. Still, the camera of the iPhone makes beautiful pictures, especially in daylight, at night, however, reveal a few weaknesses, admittedly. Nevertheless, one should not forget that we are talking here about a smartphone camera, which reaches in good lighting conditions quite a digital camera! What's new? Similar to the Apple Watch, the 6S now has a special haptic feedback on the display, 3D -Touch called. Certainly, most people will know it from advertising: If you press more easily on the display you get, for example, a preview of an e-mail and if you press harder, opens this mail. I have to confess, so far it's a nice feature, but it's not quite mature yet. This may also be due to the fact that one is too used to the classic pressure and one never really thinks that one can press more or less strongly on the display. However, the possibilities that this feature can have in the future are very diverse and Apple must be acknowledged to have brought a new innovation to the market - and the fact that there are already the first Android devices that mimic this feature , but shows that it seems to have a certain value. Of course, in the 6S, the new processor was installed, which now allows an even higher speed, but the speed of the iPhones is already so high that this appreciation hardly into the Weight seems to be falling. Despite a small memory of 2 gigabytes compared to Android devices, multitasking on the iPhone is absolutely no problem. Even with five or more games open, you can easily switch between them. Generally speaking, iOS is still one of the most potent and fastest operating systems on a smartphone. As a former Android user, I really appreciate this fact, because on Android there was this wonderful message 'Out of memory', which wanted to tell you that you had too many apps open at the same time, with the iPhone this has not happened to me yet. In general, one has to say, the iOS is running extremely stable. So far, I've never experienced an app that's frozen.I do not have to mention that the App Store offers probably the widest range of applications, nor do I have to mention that the accessory market for iPhones is much richer than for any other smartphone in the world. Another word on the new Touch ID and Many users complained that the new Touch ID was too fast, and in fact you just have to put your finger on the Home button and the fingerprint sensor will react. If you are really bothered by this, just press the button with a non-scanned finger, then the screen will not unlock. I can only say that I find it incredibly practical and fascinating how easy and uncomplicated Touch ID has become. Of course, this fingerprint sensor is not comparable to devices that play in a professional league, but you must not forget that we have here a smartphone in front of us. Online banking I would not do with the Touch ID, but to unlock the display or as a replacement for a password it is enough anyway. Many users have also complained about the smaller battery. I also had the iPhone 6, which had a nominally larger battery, but I have to say that it seems to me as if the battery in the 6S larger. With average use of the iPhone - Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox, taking photos and a bit of gaming - I still have 50 or 40 percent left over at the end of the day, which I consider a decent performance. Strangely, I never got that far on the iPhone 6, so I had to load much earlier. Of course, this is a matter of individual settings. If you set up your apps correctly, especially with regard to the background updates and the location access, you can gain a lot of battery power. Everything is perfect? ​​Unfortunately no. Still extremely annoying is the camera protruding from the case. On the one hand, this design looks extremely ugly, on the other hand, one always has the feeling that the lens of the camera can break faster. I can understand that you want to have the thinnest smartphone in the world, but the few millimeters, so that the camera would have been flush with the case as the iPhone SE, would not have been bad. Also, the display of the iPhone is still very good, offers natural colors and a high viewing angle stability, but still Apple should think about installing a higher-resolution display. It does not have to be the magical 4K or the UHD, but a few pixels more than it could already be for the price. My bottom line is that the 6S has been refined and perfected in many ways, but it still offers potential for upside, Even if the points of criticism I have mentioned are more like whining at a high level, one can expect a similarly high level of equipment and perfection for the comparatively high purchase price of the device.
8420	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Tim	5	Never been so excited	2015-12-04	de	I've always opted against iPhones, because I was the display size just too small. So I had previously a htc one X htc one and last a Samsung Galaxy s4.I must say I was thrilled from the first second iPhone 6s The optics and the feeling of having it in your hand are simply not a second time, and I'm also very excited about the battery life. Yes, the batteries are smaller than in the other smartphones in this price category, however, the software is tuned so that the battery simply holds incredibly well. Besides, it's just outstanding when gambling, the graphics are brilliant and stuttering is out of the question, I've had it for a good 10 weeks now and did not have a crash or any other bad experience with the iPhone. Of course it can recommend it to anyone, of course only if you are also ready to pay the price, which is really high, but I do not regret a penny.

8426	iPhone 6S	128GB	Space Gray	Vijfcent	2	bad reception	2015-10-22	de	I am getting black right now. In the Apple Store, I ordered the iPhone 6s 128GB and put it into operation today. I use O2 Multicard and of course I have the old iPhone 4s lying next to the improvements directly to see. All fine; 3D touch, Retina display and of course a lot of nice gimmicks. The mobile reception is very sobering; Both iPhones have the decibel indicator (iPhone Field test) set up, and the age-old bone has a paltry 20dB better reception (see picture). The crucial difference between being able to make calls or not. I have been extra waiting for the "" s "" model since in this case most of the negative aspects have been improved. Of course, I have created similar circumstances. Comparable settings (mobile data on / off), both devices with / without case, etc. do not understand me wrong; I do not want to miss my iFuhrpark anymore, but dear hardware manufacturers (and I mean all of them), please make phones again with the phone is also possible again. € 1000, - for a gadget that scolds phone and can not talk on the phone is not OK

Every Iphone has been fine so far, I've never broken one by falling or anything else. You know ITunes, you know it beforehand, it totally depends on you, it works without it. But you do not need antivirus or similar scrap like that on Android devices because you can download apps etc only from the store and not directly from the browser zB.Gutes Iphone!

With version 10.0 it worked very well, before and now at 10.02 not more, such a blunder, because otherwise it is indeed a really great operating system
8429	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	ctpowerplay	5	The best or nothing...	2015-10-31	de	Honestly, just to award a star for the new iPhone is absolutely nonsense. I've had every device since the iPhone 3 so far. In between, to let me not be dazzled by the Apple glasses also current premium android (HTC, Samsung) and even the Windows offshoot (Lumia). The iPhone is by far the best-functioning smartphone on the market. Yes, it is more expensive (but still worth something after a year or two). The only criticism for me as a user is still the partially confusing iTunes.
8430	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Jacques Chèvre	3	Usual good Apple quality but hardly any innovations	2015-10-31	de	The iPhone 6s is Apple's latest hardware release. And as always promised "" the best iPhone ever "". In my opinion, the 6s does not have enough new features ready. The functions are almost identical to the predecessor. The only new feature is the advertised 3D Touch, through which the display reacts to different pressure levels. This feature may seem handy in some places, but on the whole does not add much value (I can do the two more clicks to create a contact, for example). The performance is, however, as with any new iPhone on the highest level and in the build quality is synonymous not notice. Overall, it is a very good device, but in my opinion, you can confidently grab the predecessor and saves a whole lot of money or wait another year for the next model.

8433	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	Dirk u. Antje	3	Now IOS? From Symbian to Android to iOS	2016-05-28	de	I'm changing from Symbian to Android now iPhone.Also the iPhone never crashes completely. If, then it is more of a program that hangs. But I miss the real fm radio. That's not the case with Apple. The support for memory cards and stick are not really no not here. No automatic redial when busy and no additional apps no speed dial. At Symbian gabs already sprachwahl and read from messages offline !!!!. That does not exist anymore. The compatibility with other Android devices is still not available via Bluetooth. With apps, data can be exchanged via its own hotspot. Videos can generally not be uploaded to the iPhone without the help of a PC, unless you take them In the Appstore, the free apps are very limited or provided with a lot of advertising, these are sometimes very intrusive.For Android, there are in my opinion a lot more free useful apps that makes life easier. But who wants to have a secure device is well served with any iPhone. However, one is definitely a bit more restricted with its traffic.
8434	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Mia	3	Would like to switch from Android to iphone, but ....	2016-08-13	de	when is Apple iPhones finally having a full HD display? Or fast charging, notification LED, larger internal memory and above all a much larger battery? And a lower SAR value would also be great! Apple has very clear advantages, because the hardware and software come from one house and there are regular updates. The security and stability of the programs is top. But the products are so incredibly expensive and it hangs on so basics: - /. As long as especially display resolution, battery and memory do not change, I'll probably stay with Samsung ....

8436	iPhone 6S	64GB	Rose Gold	Patrick Peter Schmidt	2	Too restrictive	2016-04-06	de	I bought the iPhone 6s because I am very satisfied with the iMac 5K. However, taking over my old files from the Samsung Galaxy S 5 did not work out at all! In the settings of the font, which is also very small, there are only 2 options. The smartphone is really good, if you always had Apple devices. In any case, Android's transition is paved with violent stumbling blocks. I would have wished that with such an expensive device a reasonable software to take over the files of Android devices is! That's why I gave the smartphone back. As I said, the smartphone is good, but these restrictive Apple speak for me currently against the iPhone. Maybe it manages so that Android smartphones are recognized on the iMac and there is a software for data synchronization between Android and Windows Phone devices.
8437	iPhone 6S	64GB	Argent 	Stefan Kretzschmar	1	Steve Jobs would turn in the grave	2016-01-23	de	I changed from the 5s to the 6s, so I'm used to Apple. What strikes me are the small nuances that creep in. This starts with the shorter battery life and continues with the scratching and shaking of the original Apple EarPod plug when I plug the device into my pocket or touch the connector. Sure, I could use my Sennheiser headphones but I do not want that and was not necessary until the 5s because the original accessories reflected a basic quality. Other nuances are the protruding camera, which does not bother me since I use an original Apple leather case. However, it represents a design carver that would have been impossible with jobs. The case shows further changes. The case no longer encloses the whole device but leaves the lower part of the speaker, Lightning and Micro open and unprotected. In addition to the fact that the two lower corners visible not as complex Complete as the old case of 5s leaves it with the overall appearance of a strange taste and makes it appear less high-quality altogether. The only thing that is still accustomed Apple is the price. In conclusion, disappointing for me. The zenith is over. Apart from my remarks, it certainly remains a solid device that its lovers will find. I do not belong anymore and will give it back despite financial loss and hope that my 5s still works.

8441	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	nexus-hh	1	Overpriced high-tech scrap	2016-07-23	de	I got the iPhone 6s cheap from the circle of acquaintances, otherwise I always had Android devices. But since I have an iPad, I already knew the software a bit. So the processing is already the first criticism, the slide for the Nano Sim card can move with too much game when it is plugged. Even the home button has too much play and clacking for this price range. The back scratched extremely lightly, the front not so easy. You can not offer a cell phone for such a high price and then say that customers should buy a protective cover so that it does not scratch, it has to be built more robust, so it will be a shoe out of it! In this respect, the much-praised processing quality of iPhones is just a marvel, you just have to look closely, then you realize the miscibility, which are simply unacceptable in the price range. Otherwise, the screen is sharp, but in 2016 with its 4.7 inches and HD resolution not up to date, it should be in my opinion already 5 inches, incomprehensible that Apple is there so hesitant and backward-facing. The operation is really bad in relation to Android devices. This concept of closing with the home button has never opened to me. Why not use the backspace or exit key as touch keys ?? This is also possible with the Assistive Touch function, but not very elegant. The apps run smoothly, but updates take too long even in the WLAN network. The cameras are both good, there is nothing to moan about. The more outrageous that one does not install an optical image stabilizer in this price range. The camera looks out of the too heavy case out (just under 140 grams), the device gets very hot under high load, the battery is a bad joke, no FM radio included, resolution under Full HD. All in all, the device for 850 euros new price in the 64 GB version is much too expensive and the money should make more sense to invest. But as long as there are enough people who throw money into the mouth of Apple for such technology, the probably more fat and the poor factory workers in China are getting dehydrated. Apple runs the Android manufacturers technically for years afterwards. 3D-Touch does not need a human, it would be enough, you hold down a little longer than to apply so much pressure on the screen. Something completely incomprehensible: the fingerprint sensor works only after you have previously pressed the power or home button. Other manufacturers can do that so that you only have to hang up your finger and it is unlocked. The headphones from Apple are miserable, both in sound and build quality, and also slip out of the ear due to the strange shape. The voice quality when telephoning is in view of the price just as bad to call, there is always an annoying noise floor available. I give the iPhone 6S now someone who really wants it, I do not, what a miserable phone.
8442	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	Spacebo	1	A shame	2016-09-11	de	This is doubtless a work of magisterial technology, but how can anoyne buy a product from a company that won't pay its taxes? Shame on Apple!
8443	iPhone 6S	16GB	Space Gray	IP	1	Scrap screen and overpriced	2016-03-29	de	It is a nice mobile phone with a nice design. The software is quite good and has only crashed once. But the price of the phone (then 800 euros) is extremely overpriced. The added value I see here (with the exception of the camera) not. Because with a cheap HTC or Blackberry is just as clear and that costs less than half. Naughty the price but in the face of the shabby screen. Once dropped on the ground, a nice thick crack is visible. At Apple I was told that I should have attached a cover. At 800 euros I would have thought that the material is now a bit more resistant (in the iPhones 1 and 2, almost every second copy was affected by this deficiency). Even my cheap Blackberry, which I had used before, flew to the ground every week and nothing happened. In the future I will refrain from joining this hipster mania to enjoy a minimalistic scrap with a maximailistic crack. The next time I scrape together 800 euros, I'll rather buy 800 cheeseburgers at McDonald's - or 450 cheeseburgers plus 1 Blackberry. Then I'm not so hip, but at least survive the next hunger period and at least can still look at the scratch-free cheap screen of Blackberry.

8447	iPhone 6S	64GB	Space Gray	ohlen	1	Big Apple is watching you! Go JOLLA PHONE!	2016-02-22	de	My urgent recommendation (26.03.2016): Switch to the Jolla-Phone. Finnish understatement, a hundred times hipper than Apple's all-round bug. And also without anti-democratic NSA connection (no 5eye, no Patriot Act)! I have now made the detour via Blackberry (using the Canadians '5eye' Android) to JOLLA. Ergonomic, reliable, removable battery, 2-3 days battery life. For 199, - €. in 5 days the JollaPhone is with you. Incl. Right of Withdrawal - Take the opportunity and try it out! And one more thing: anyone who clicks anonymously on the negative side or, in part, pitifully condescending to the new Stasi, has already lost today. Resist, Leite. Freedom is more important than all these apps for teens.Here's the review ... I was a fan and a loyal customer of Apple. Have bought a number of professional Apple computers, iPods, iPhones and tablets from the manufacturer and gladly used. After the group acts as a stooge of various anti-democratic intelligence agencies, all of which violate our liberal fundamental rights, I will the group until further notice, no "" fresh Money "" Apple has become the pioneer of all henchmen of total surveillance. Virtually everything that happens on the internet is collected in Utah (Utah Data Center -> google). Data about unwelcome journalists. Data about our politicians of tomorrow. Data on decision-makers in politics and business, which deviate too much from the course.Democracy is being eroded. People become blackmailable! Apple is the only smartphone maker ALL component hardware firmware software (iOS operating system) - Synchronization software and MediaShop (iTunes) This combination requires a responsible, confidential handling of personal customer data. This responsibility was and is Apple as an NSA cooperation partner does justice. Keywords: - Private data, contacts, information on media user behavior is not protected from access by third parties - Apple's NSA cooperation (US intelligence, which closely monitors the FRG) - GPS -Data / motion profiles land on US servers, to which the US secret service NSA has direct access.- Software with "" backdoors "" provided - hardware remotely controllable (camera, microphone) - fingerprint scanner (this feature would have me in one SouthPark episode on the NSA cooperation requested) - questionable for professional use, eg. B for investigative journalists (informant protection), judges, lawyers, politicians, environmental activists, doctors and young people who want to pursue a comparable career - French and Brazilian parliamentarians are prohibited from using such devices for security reasons - As a luxury device in the professional segment only conditionally suitable - THANK YOU EDWARD SNOWDEN! - THANK YOU GLENN GREENWALD! - THANK YOU "" THE GUARDIAN ""! Further: - Foxconn (maximum return for shareholders) Otherwise, a great device. Private users, who are uncritical of developments in government surveillance and data retention, are likely to enjoy their device. Note ("Apple did not have a choice ..."): "There is a positive example, a company called" "lavabit" ". A provider of encrypted communications. Mr. Snowden has sometimes communicated about this service. The NSA wanted to force the managing director, Mr. Ladar Levison, to publish a general key or access to the server / user data. Mr. Levison preferred to quit his job, his livelihood. I'm sure that if Apple, Microsoft, google, yahoo, facebook, skype had gone public together in due course, an NSA boss would have lost his job and finished. It looks like all of these companies are architects of total surveillance. Maybe to defend democratic values ​​in faith. At least since we know that the "democratization" of countries like Iraq or Ukraine clearly does not aim to improve the lives of the people, it is important to punish the accomplices and their followers.Who is committed to freedom and Sometimes betraying democracy by doing commissioned work for Apple or its clients here should make it ashamed and think about what mess he / she will leave to his / her children. Do not participate. Perform resistance!

8470	iPhone 6S Plus	128GB	Space Gray	norway123	4	The surfboard under the smartphones	2015-10-28	de	### Preview ### For just under a ¾ year I was a satisfied user of a 64 GB iPhone 6 Plus (built in 12/2014) and yet last week I made the switch to the iPhone 6s Plus, there were reasons for that many are the 6 Plus or 6s Plus simply too big and seemingly unwieldy. Not only does it look huge, no, it is too. And I say: woe Apple makes it smaller! I got used to this big device so much that all the other "normal" smartphones seemed far too small for me. If it were not the 6s Plus, then I would rather treat myself to a Samsung Galaxy Note instead of the "smaller" Samsung S models, which are not really small on their own. Nevertheless, those who like me and read a lot of texts on the smartphone (newspaper blogs, emails, PDF's, etc.) will quickly appreciate the great display and learn to love, especially since the view in the cross-mode splits (depending on the setting). Also games, Photo editing etc. is much easier on the hand, because it is just bigger. In addition, the larger housing also houses a larger battery, which increases the running and standby times more than clearly. But more on that later. ### Design + Colors ### The design has not changed, the workmanship and material quality are above all doubt, at this price an absolute must. At most, the dimensions have increased minimally, so it has grown almost at all corners by about 0.1 mm. But honestly you do not see it, even "" old "bumpers and cases are still fit. More in the truest sense of the word - in the weight - fallen the increase of 20 grams, you feel that more in the hand. But I think it is in the direct comparison fuller and more stable than its predecessor. I find the slightly increased weight therefore very pleasant. Reason for the slight weight gain are not only a changed interior equipment, but above all the use of a higher quality aluminum alloy called aluminum 7000. This type of alloy is mainly used in space, for high-quality sports equipment and in aircraft and is characterized by the admixture of Zinc with high hardness and flexural rigidity. Exactly the latter caused probably Apple to use this aluminum alloy for its latest generation of smartphones. The so-called "Bentgate" of the iPhone 6 and in particular of the 6 Plus should not be repeated. There were probably users who actually, whether unintentionally in their trouser pockets or wantonly, with a lot of strength, schaften to bend these devices. My "" old "6 Plus still looks like the first day, nothing has bent. But I should be right if the 6s Plus in this discipline has become even more resistant. Who wants to complain, yes, the camera module is still standing out, so that you can not even put the 6s Plus on a pad, but mobile phone Sheaths that are used by almost everyone compensate for this disadvantage. The new Apple's own silicone cases not only look chic at last, but also fit perfectly on and around the smartphone. In addition, the case also extends around the edge, so that you can put the phone on the display page, the small edge prevents a direct Auflage.Velleicht another word about the colors. After the gold entry of past model series, the manufacturer now offers rose gold. My taste does not match, but the ladies and maybe not just those will be delighted. Depending on the light / light type (daylight, LED, fluorescent), the rose gold, really noble golden, but also fine pink to the vile bright pink. It is not ugly, it just depends on the individual taste. Which I honestly do not like, but due to cases does not come to fruition, the unsightly plastic strips (antennas) on the back. In terms of design, I like to give 4 stars.### Technical Features ### Are there any differences between the 6 Plus and the 6s Plus and the normal 6s? Yes, there are and there are not many. So in the predecessor model the 6 Plus is still working with the Apple A8 chip, while the two new flagships, the 6s and 6s Plus, already house the latest generation, the Apple A9 chip. Although both processors A8 and A9 are only dual-core processors, the competition here with 4-8 Kernern on, but the combination of modern chip architecture, adapted and perfectly matched software chasing the benchmark results of both types of chips in the top league. Hardware and software work together perfectly, because they are tailored to each other and designed. In addition, the latest generation of Apple processors is operated at an increased rate. But even here there are differences, while in the 6s the A 9 chip is clocked at 1.7 Ghz, he may work in the 6s plus with 1.8 Ghz. But not only the main processor, there are differences. Also in the graphics area a surprise awaits the user. Thus, in the "old" 6 Plus and new 6s the PowerVR GX6450 fuel the graphics, in the new 6s Plus, on the other hand, the next generation of the PowerVR GT7600.Der differences are even more. Thus, the batteries have changed to their predecessor models in their charge capacity. If you could still draw on the whopping 2,915 mAh in the 6 Plus, the 6s Plus "only" has an additional 2,750 mAh, while the smaller 6s is even more dramatic. Only a 1,715 mAh battery is available here. But does lower battery power inevitably mean less mileage and overall power? No, not necessarily, as I could find in everyday life, just about the same. But further to the differences. The display from 6 plus to 6s plus is almost identical. 5.5 inches and a pixel density of 401 ppi flatter the eye. At best, the brightness and contrast range have changed to 6 Plus. In the 6s Plus, the screen shines with 535 cd / m² instead of 513 cd / m² and the contrast has increased to 1133: 1. In a direct comparison you can see the difference, but not in everyday life. Both screens are full and brilliant with beautiful natural colors. It is interesting in this comparison, the screen of the normal 6s that not only with 4.7 inches significantly smaller, but also has a lower pixel density of 326 ppi. But to calm the mind, the pixel density is synonymous in relation to the total size of the display, synonymous with the normal 6s, the picture looks crisp, bright and rich in detail. In direct comparison, I can not find any differences from the 6s Plus to the 6s or even the old 6 Plus. Among the more important innovations, in addition to the new main camera of 12 MP to formerly 8 MP and the front camera with now 5 MP to formerly 1.2 MP. Already in the old 6 Plus an active optical image stabilizer was installed, so also in the new model, the 6s plus. Less with normal photos, but in the video section you can feel and see clearly the advantages of the stabilizer. In addition, the entire 6s model family has a barometer (pressure gauge), which was previously not available at Apple and in this context, for the first time on a pressure-sensitive screen, called Force Touch at Apple From my point of view, the most noticeable difference is in the increase in memory from 1 to 2 MB. The same goes for more. The iPhone 6s Plus comes with a charger and the latest generation of headphones that, unlike earlier models, are no longer so conspicuous. Tip: the Noise-quiet remote control on the headphones can also be used as a remote trigger for the camera.When it comes to equipment, I like to award 5 stars, also owed to the new Force-Touch-Display. ### Everyday life and benefits ### Exciting questions, what do I get as a user all the technical features in everyday life? Why should I buy such an expensive smartphone? There are many reasons for purchasing decisions. Many will put off the high price and the size of the device or even the brand (keyword: Markenjünger and / or Apple hater). Others, like me, will be thrilled. Enthusiastic about the performance and the technical possibilities, apart from all the design dubblers and brand prestige. For me a mobile phone has to work, and that if it works in every situation. That already did the iPhone 1 or 4s. But developments continue, demands increase and so can the latest generation in addition to all sorts of electronics Schnick-Schnack with excellent everyday qualities shine. The Force-Touch technology is still in its infancy, but it facilitates the handling, such. in the car! I have to quickly write a thought memo or fix a shot in the photo change ... nothing easier than that, press harder and if necessary. select small submenu, done. Switching back and forth in the usual menu items etc. is not necessary. Also, you can now use the iPhone as a scale .. no longer an issue. Resourceful developers have put the first apps in the App Store. Tip, the pressure sensitivity of the display can be adjusted in the setting, so the delicate fingers of the woman do not have to press so hard. The great display spoiled but also the classic attributes, as already mentioned, with rich natural colors, a crystal clear and sharp Presentation and an extremely large viewing angle. In addition, it is sufficiently bright when you should be in the glistening sunlight. The size simply flatters the eye, because especially the image displays appear much larger, also font and characters are very legible thanks to larger representation. If that is not enough, as in any iPhone, the font in general. But unlike the normal 6er is the 6s Plus (even with the predecessor) lost less image information, since the display is large enough to continue to represent everything (no zoom or wiping required). That's it, too, which makes the 6 Plus and the new 6s Plus so covetous, the big screen. Even text files in Word etc. can be edited much more convenient, you do not need an iPad / Tablet or PC screen. The increase in memory to 2 GB in conjunction with the new generation of chips then guarantees ultra-fast working. Access to apps is more or less immediately implemented. Also multitasking works - especially with the functions of the Force-Touch super. In direct comparison, the new 6s Plus in terms of speed compared to the 6 Plus predecessor model has increased significantly. I'm honest, I could have imagined a 4GB of memory very well, a more is always good. The subject of battery, yes the energy storage is in the 6s Plus compared to its predecessor shrunk slightly and no, one must not compromise on the use and Run time. I'm speaking here for the plus series. Apparently the new hardware components are more economical with the expensive electricity.As with the old 6 Plus, the battery will last for 1-2 working days, depending on the intensity of use, even with 6s Plus. If you do not use it at all or only a little (and / or just to make a phone call) you have almost a week of standby power. With full use of all resources, games and the internet, the 6s Plus can not conjure up and is empty after one working day. But in total, I am highly satisfied with the battery performance. All day and benefit gets from me 5 stars. ### Photo-Video and Image Editing ### Yes, the new 12 MP camera including image stabilizer are a real show. If the pictures on the 6 Plus were already very good, they are even more so on the 6s Plus. Not necessarily the Schärfeleistung, no that was also great before, no, the rich in detail of the recordings logically increased with increasing pixels. The notorious pixel color noise is pleasingly limited, and here the software works pretty well. More in the positive weight is more likely than the 5 MP front camera. Great that the selfis now sharp and not so pixilated. In addition, the display can be used as a flash replacement, this lights up intensively bright. Beautiful gimmick, the Live Photo function, which exists only for the S models. A tiny video sequence is added to the photo file before and after the actual photo shoot, with the result that the images look as if they are alive. I use it so far not so often, but a nice Extra.Technikverliebte the video 4K resolution love. The videos are also thanks to the image stabilizer (there are only the 6 Plus and 6s Plus) extremely sharp, rich in detail and almost free of shaking.Problem, who uses 4 K, also consumes a corresponding amount of memory. With the 64 GB model still no problem but with the 16 GB 6er it becomes fast closely on the storage ranks. In addition, only a few monitors and TV's can represent real 4K material as such. So if you do not like the Monsterpixelschleuder and spare his memory volume, can also film in the normal Full HD mode, the quality is almost identical for the eye on smaller screens. The image processing by Apple is already good, who wants more can be appropriate App's load, these can be called since the iOS 8 also directly from the photo app. Thanks to the huge screen, the image processing works much better than with the standard-sized model.5 stars in this discipline. ### Price - Performance ### You get what Apple has to offer, but does it really have to be so damn expensive? Also Samsung and Co. build powerful giant phones. Certainly, the Force Touch technology offers yet. The performance is impressive, but I think that it is simply very expensive to own this phone, so only 3 stars, sorry. ### Overall view: pros and cons ### Positive: + perfect workmanship + big, very sharp and bright display with generally larger images + pressure-sensitive and forward-looking force touch display + strong battery with high operating and standby times + very high performance, also thanks to more RAM of 2 GB + software perfectly matched to the hardware + great 12 MP camera with active image stabilizer + 5 MP Front camera for perfect selfi's + outstanding video qualities in Full HD and 4 K mode + very high speech intelligibility and good general acoustics + in relation good value stability, what the high cost price mitigates something Negative: - Size (the advantage namely the large display is also the biggest disadvantage) - protruding camera module- very high price ### Conclusion ### Who a looking for more than powerful communication tool of the 21st century, which still fits in a jacket pocket or trouser pocket, who not only wants to make phone calls, but also for all the things of a modern (office) everyday life, with the iPhone 6s Plus is very well-advised.Modern performance-optimized hardware meets perfectly matched software, in combination, this results in a powerful communication tool, with for today's conditions in the world of smartphones, long battery life.The camera performance was already on the 6 plus Plus, this was still refined, what in the Result can produce impressive pictures. If you want, you can also record live photos (moving photos) and videos in 4K quality. The modern Force-Touch technology goes in the right direction and facilitates fast access to functions considerably. For me, a great smartphone in admitted 4.4 Stars for the very high practicality (based on my personal needs)

That turned out to be really a mistake because Samsung, as always, is not nearly as fluid and enjoyable as Apple The fingerprint sensor at Samsung is the purest catastrophe, where at Apple, the thing is just running and always works top Samsung leaves to be really wishful about. Now I'm back to the iPhone 6s Plus 128gb and I'm so happy, it's really just better, faster and feels better. Apple has learned from the glass back of the iPhone 4, the aluminum at this point is simply much better, unfortunately, Samsung did not understand that .. I can advise everyone and repeat what my daughter says, once Apple always Apple .. Me had made the mistake and will never do it again .. Apple is running and doing better, faster and more reliably like everybody else ..

Also not long ago it has been exposed Apple have been providing software updates for customers with older Apple products in order to slow down performance of their Apple product, making customers believe they need to replace their Apple products with new Apple products.This scandal has been reported in the mainstream media and there are plans to bring a class action against Apple for this immoral practice. Many customers can not afford a replacement and would like their phone to last as long as possible and what you get is the manufacturer these customers trusted giving them updates to slow down their product and ultimately profit from it and there are privacy concerns and backdoor access issues with this smartphone.Thanks for reading my review I hope you found it helpful.
8475	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Nouman Khalid	4	Solid Performer	2018-12-04	uk	This phone came in perfect packaging, thanks to Amazon. The phone itself was bought for my wife, who loves it. The gold colour really does look very nice and you can tell the build quality is very premium. I think the face unlock is good but they should have kept the fingerprint scanner. But then again, maybe that is the way forward! The reason why I did not give the iPhone XS a 5 star is because I think it is overpriced, despite it's quality. But that's just my opinion. :)

I bought mine a few months ago on a special deal, I got a 256gb fir the price of a 64gb.Over the last few months this phone has obliterated anything thrown at it from intensive programs to 4K live streams, augmented reality it can handle anything, it is raw power. Battery life is poor, if you are a power user you will be out of charge within 6 - 8 hours. So keep that in mind. I’ve dropped this phone on solid marble tiles and it didnt leave a scratch, they are durable, but take no risk, buy a sturdy case.It’s a great phone, the best money can currently buy, but wait for the prices to drop, because they are very expensive,l.

8511	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Grey	C. Sanders	3	Impressive but big flaws	2019-05-06	uk	So you read all the reviews and they say how amazing this is but there are some aspects that seriously undermined this phone.Firstly the good.Performance - slickCamera - excellent and love the portrait (although it’s not a quick one to use)Battery - ok not amazing but better than previous versionsThe badThe screen - very bright but scratches like a CD. Never had a scratch on any of my previous 6+ iPhones but this one has many after a few months. Will seriously affect resale value.Face ID. Oh my god I hate it. Sooo slooow. Have to wait every time whilst it unlocks. Doesn’t work well in dark or with sunglasses. With finger print I did occasionally have to enter code but now I do it half the time. Reset my ID a lot but no different. It’s a nice gimmick but that’s all it is. Bring back finger print, please.
8512	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Grey	Adam	1	Waste of money	2018-11-18	uk	Not very good don’t upgrade if your thinking about it, not worth 1K
8513	iPhone XS	256GB	Silver	Trevor	1	Iphone waste of money	2019-01-20	uk	Iphones are over rated over price i never buy one i just bought Samsung Galaxy A9 has 4 cameras on the back each one 24mp starts with 180gb expendable to 512gb so bought the handset and sd card 512gb for 2 only paid £550 that well under half price of an iphone Samsung android itself much faster using internet too takes seconds to use internet even very fast connecting to wifi

8518	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Grey	Mr. D. J. WENZEL	4	Beautiful but fragile	2019-04-25	uk	At first I was not blown away, but after tweaking the settings and getting used to the new gestures, I’m a big fan.On the downside, after only a few months and a single low drop, I’ve chipped the corner of the screen. Oh for truly tough screens...
8519	iPhone XS	256GB	Space Grey	RGomes11	5	Best iPhone Yet!	2019-03-03	uk	Really was unsure about the value for money with this phone as you can get more storage and performance for less money from other phone companies.However this little phone has really surprised me! Super quick and responsive, great to have a little more storage for photos etc. Camera performs really really well.Overall really pleased, fantastic phone. Would recommend for anyone who is an apple person :)
8520	iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Julie	5	Great phone!	2019-05-01	uk	Had this phone for about 6 weeks now, what a great phone! I was still on an iPhone 6 (which I’ve used for the past 4 years, that served me well) so this was an amazing upgrade for me. 256gb for under 1k is a good price, looks good, feels lovely, works fast, photos are excellent! Glad I made this purchase, would highly recommend if upgrading from any phone 3 - 4 years old!

8536	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Grey	Nikos S	5	Good but overpriced a lot.	2019-07-07	uk	It is a sturdy and quality phone you can feel it. It has perfect analogies size of the phone and size of the display, for people that do not want big phones but want clear view of the screen. But those qualities you can find them on iPhone x also and if someone does not care to have full display screen phone then in iPhone 7 without paying 1000 pounds or so. There is no value for money here.
8537	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Space Grey	Craig Griffiths	5	Supersized Experience	2018-10-18	uk	First of all, the name of this iPhone is slightly confusing. XS Max. XS would normally indicate something that is extra small and max would usually suggest maximum size. However, there is absolutely no confusion about the quality of this product.If you look beyond the puzzling name, you'll be staring into the deep black depths of a stunning 6.5-inch OLED Super Retina display. Have you ever wanted to stare deep into the abyss of a black hole? Well, now you can for just £1,249. I went for the Space Grey colour option, due to the mystery and unknown that is often associated with outer space.The battery life is fantastic so far, lasting around a day and a half with moderate use. As opposed to my previous iPhone 7, which lasted about as long as a typical Tinder relationship. Ironically, this app was not only detrimental to the battery life of the iPhone 7, but also as my actual life.This iPhone has been my first experience using Face ID. I now wish that I could unlock more things using my face.The A12 bionic chip is a marvel. I can now switch between apps and ignore my friends and family up to 15% faster than ever before. Additionally, with the dual SIM slots, I can now be ignorant at home as well as abroad.I have found the Screen Time App to be particularly useful. Not only does it pin point the exact time of day that I miss my ex-girlfriend, it also shows me exactly how addicted to this phone I really am.Overall, my verdict of the iPhone XS Max is this: it may not solve the inner torment and angst that we all go through as human souls. It is however, a lovely distraction.

8545	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Silver	Steve W	5	"Quality, as expected."	2019-06-20	uk	As far as I’m concerned there’s nothing I don’t like about this phone, apart from the cost of course, but it’s an Apple product so you would expect that. Just de-boxing the phone is a sensual experience to be savoured. Yes, it’s too expensive but I love it!I’ve been used to an iPhone 6s and compared to that the battery life is unbelievable. Only had it a couple of days but I’ve not got anywhere near needing to plug it in for a to up during the day. I’m sure it will go for around one and a half days of reasonable use. The camera is superb and I’ve not experienced and problems so far with the facial recognition that is so much better than the fingerprint recognition. As for the home button - I though I might miss that and find myself desperately poking the bottom of the phone to switch back to home but I’ve not done it once yet.
8546	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	sheniqua Taylor	2	Be careful Phone did not last 10 minutes before it ran hot	2019-06-17	uk	I don't know what happened here, the delivery was great, but for some strange reason after opening and fully charging the phone while i was trying to set it up the phone started to get hot not sure why but i was so hot i had to turn it off and left it for a bit, i used the charger it came with to charge so i don't know why it was running hot but it did. when i turned it back on to continue with the set up lol it got hot even faster. so yea i was left with maybe 30 minutes of the phone usage before i packed it up and drop it off to return by Hermes which was a whole terrible experience. I have not heard from anyone since it was return June 1, 2019, even the tracking information is f-ed up. So yeah if you want a phone that will work please just go to Apple it will be worth it trust me

8564	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Gold	E. Spinks	1	Not worth it.	2019-06-15	uk	Seriously not worth the money.Sure it's got an Apple logo but value for money wise. Appalling.For £500 less can get a Samsung S10 with twice the storage and expandable.Or less than half the price an oppo7 with 256gig storage.And then the build quality, sure it looks nice but drop in on the sofa and the screen will crack.Apple doesn't care about it's customers any more, too many people see the logo and follow the pack. Open your eyes. Can honestly say will never go back to Apple.

8574	iPhone XS Max	256GB	Silver	PTZ	5	The biggest and best iphone ever has landed!	2018-09-29	uk	I have used the phone extensively at the Apple store as well as through my friend who bought one recently.What's in the box?• Apart from the phone, Lightning EarPods, Lightning to USB cable, user guide and standard 5W Power Adapter are included.Screen -This screen is very good! Very crisp and vibrant. However, I feel the blacks are not as deeper to the naked eye. The maximum brightness level is very good. This is even more than the closest Android rival Galaxy Note 9.The size of screen is 6.5 inches diagonally. The resolution is 1242 x 2688 pixels. The notch on the top of the screen may keep people divided.Build Quality-Very good. In par with the iPhone X /Galaxy Note 9 and probably better than Google Pixel 2 phone. Non removable back.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, and the sterio speakers are more than adequate. Has NO headphone jack. There is no headphone jack compatible dongle either included,  but you can buy it easily.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag at all.Is the 4 GB RAM not adequate? I think it is. I found no lag in how the phone functioned, despite lower RAM compared to the Android counterparts.Added features-Micro SD slot is NOT available. This phone is water and dust (IP68) resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP DUAL lens back camera.Very good photos in good daylight. Good low light photos as well. The front camera is good at 7MP, but could have been better(may be a front flash next time?) Good for selfies but nothing compared to the back camera.The cameras are identical to iphone X on paper, but the end results are ever so slightly better and consistent. The low light photos are better because the pixel sizes are bigger.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good. But then it has to be bought through an authorised reseller.However, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon. You can purchase additional warranty through Apple care.Battery-Very good 3174 mAH battery. There is a quick charge function. But this is not as fast as the dash charge in One plus 5/6.You may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one day of use on this, if you are a moderate to heavy user.Operating System-Runs iOS 12 out of the box, and this runs brilliantly. Apple do the software side of things in a more mature way than Android counterparts including Samsung. The icons per se are much more mature than Samsung. iOS 12 is fluid and very easy to use. But iOS has its restrictions compared to Android, such as not being able to modify easily.Security features-Face ID works well and worked without an issue almost everytime I used it.No fingerprint sensor is available.Price-The recommended retail price at present is £999 for the 64GB version of iphone Xs and £1099 for 64GB version of iphone Xs Max, which is very steep. The RRP for the iphone Xs Max 512GB version is £1449 though, and think before you buy , do you actually need that amount of storage on the phone?Colour-It currently comes in space grey, silver and gold. If you like a clean look, then Space grey is your option. It gives a more official (but probably boring, according to some) look. If you buy the I personally feel the Gold colour is very nicely done, and is not gaudy at all.Dual sim?Dual sim is available through an Esim.Is there anything else I would have wished the iphone Xs to have?1. Headphone jack. This actually may not happen ever. But the truth of the matter is a jacked headphone so easy to use, and does not need re-charging, hence I love it , compared ot a Bluetooth headphone2. Notchless display3. Bigger battery (yes, 4000mAH next year may be? :) and faster quick charge function )4.Slightly better low-light photo performance.This, or the iPhone X?iphone X has been discontinued, so if you want to buy it brand new it won’t be available. But in the second hand market you could get the iphone X for about £400 less than Xs max, so if you don’t mind the size, iphone X may be a good option.So, you have the iphone X. Should you buy the Iphone Xs or Xs Max?On the surface, the iphone Xs is an incremental upgrade, and you may wonder whether you actually need the iphone Xs Max.But the short answer - yes you should probably still upgrade.Why?1. Iphone Xs has improvements such as slightly faster performance, better water/dust resistance (IP68 vs IP67), better camera for low light photos (see above for details) .2. One year down the line, the iphoneX will be valued at around £200 if you want to sell and upgrade to iphone 2019 (which is about £700 less than the RRP) and at present there are some good trade- in deals around for the iphone X. Hence, you probably would give your phone and upgrade for about £350 more, which I feel is reasonable.3. You will also have the latest tech in your hands!But, the ultimate decision is yours :)If you have Iphone 8/8 plus, should you upgrade?Short answer- yes you should. There is plenty of reason.Any questions about the  iphone Xs/Xs Max, please ask and I will try to answer them to the best of my knowledge.If you feel the review is unhelpful, can you please say why in the comments below, so I can improve my future reviews. Thank you.
8575	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Silver	SK	4	V.Good	2019-06-13	uk	Maybe not 5* for value for money because it is an absolute mammoth of a price.But user experience is very good, fluid animations and has reachability feature to allow easier one handed operational use.Battery life could be better, just not as long lasting as the s10+ which admittedly has a larger battery size. If your not a video user, it may be viewed as good battery for you.Coming from Android to iOS is tough because music and videos are not easy to get across, iOS is quite limited in that regard and requires iTunes to make this all possibleOverall, guaranteed iOS 13 and likely 14 so It’s also futureproof
8576	iPhone XS Max	512GB	Gold	ProductWarrior	5	Stupdenous	2019-06-08	uk	A really great device and certainly the best on the market right now, at the cheapest price too - Normally retailers charge £200 for extra memory but Amazon don't, I bought this one as it has higher resale value and it really is a beautiful, great phone in the gold finish.

8589	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Sal	5	Absolutely no need to go for the more expensive XS!	2019-03-02	uk	The phone is bigger than the XS but retains all the good stuff. It's a solid phone with incredible battery life. The camera is as good and only lacks the zoom lens, which most people never use anyway. The screen is great, with great accurate colours. I am not used to OLED however and like LCD as a whole.The phone itself is quite large and thick (the latter is great for battery life) so I would recommend seeing one in person before purchase. It sits in between the XS and XS Max sizes. It is a fractionally smaller in size than 6/7/8 Plus phones but with a larger screen due to small edges.I was most worried about 3D Touch but they added similar long-presses for most convenient 3D Touch actions. I am a heavy user of 3D Touch and whilst I miss it in some areas it covers most of my needs. If you don't know what 3D Touch is... then great! Even less reason to buy the XS or XS Max.Unfortunately at full price still not a cheap phone but it's definitely not a low-effort product.
8590	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Eljay	5	Switched from Android to the iPhone XR and very happy	2018-12-24	uk	i've been an Android user for the last 6 years and just had endless problems and thought enough is enough and once i saw the XR and the specs, like everyone else i laughed and asked who would want this phone?  It wasn't until i went into the Apple Store that i saw the build quality and the screen and was blown away...how on earth is this screen only 828p? It looks sharp and gorgeous.I went for the White 64GB model which looks the best out of all of models in my opinion. The black front and the white back is like a storm trooper phone. Looks really nice and feels really nice in the hand. The new gestures are amazing, once you get used to them you can't go back. The phone is also so smooth and will stay smooth.The apps are of higher quality than i experienced on Android, Face ID is a revelation and a game changer. The camera is very good too, as good as a Pixel 3 (according to DXOMARK)All in all i'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend. if you are on an older iPhone or are thinking about switching over from Android then you won't be disappointed.
8591	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	wayne	5	"Large, Clear, Functional"	2019-02-12	uk	I bought this for my son for a Christmas present.  Choosing between the smaller OLED and this larger LED was difficult, but as my son mainly uses it for watching videos, video chat, and messaging, the larger screen size won out.The image quality is still excellent (and that is coming from an Adroid fan) and the overall build is really good too.Battery life is really good - His 2 year old 6s? would hold a charge for < 1 day.  This one lasts over 1 1/2 with quite heavy usage.As Apple Phones go, this was a tad expensive, but an overall good purchase.
8592	iPhone XR	64GB	White	J. R.Leeson	5	Almost perfect.	2019-02-27	uk	My partner bought this for me (much to my surprise) and although I've only had it for a couple of days I would recommend it.  Just a couple of points that might be of interest to someone/anyone and that is although I entered the face recognition in the phone it so far has not opened with this feature.  I still have to enter a code manually.  Also, there is no button at the bottom of the phone to press, but I guess this is just something I am used to with my old iphone 6 and it is merely personal preference.
8593	iPhone XR	128GB	White	PA	5	A joy to use	2019-01-01	uk	Upgrade from iPhone 7 loving the new screen size, functionality, smooth transition to the new device overall a joy
8594	iPhone XR	128GB	Yellow	Robert Vogan	3	Purple hue on front camera	2019-02-28	uk	Phone is completely fine except the front camera has some purple hue on it which has been like this since it arrived. I have requested a replacement but it’s just a bit of a pain to wait on it arriving and to post the old one back when I spent so long updating my content from my MacBook.
8595	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Gareth G	5	Iphone xr white	2019-01-03	uk	Totally love this phone, got every thing i need on it and easy to use.
8596	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Kyle curran	4	Face recognition	2019-01-22	uk	The face recognition stopped working straight away
8597	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Amazon Customer	5	"Great to use, unbelievable battery life (for an iPhone)"	2019-04-17	uk	Bought as a replacement for an iPhone 8, this is a useful step up. The larger screen makes a large difference to usability and is clear and bright. The FaceID works superbly, much better than TouchID. I am also really happy with the camera performance, the portrait mode works well. Overall a great phone and can use extensively during the day and still have 50% battery left which is a pleasant surprise.
8598	iPhone XR	64GB	White	Cat	5	Big screen... Big battery...	2019-03-23	uk	Upgrading from the iPhone 7 I’ve noticed the difference with this bigger wider screen and, I must say, I’m simply loving it!!Battery last long time
8599	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	McFlono McFlunilu	5	Screen is actually really good! Better than expected!	2019-06-17	uk	I'm absolutely delighted with that phone. Yes it is a bit expensive but it is definitely worth it. I had some reservations regarding the screen, people say it is not oled etc. but the screen is actually amazing, I have compared it to the Xs next to each and that’s the only time when you can spot a difference and the extra money for the XS is not worth it, when you also take in mind that you get exactly the same chip processor! Runs great and the battery life is really good, for a heavy user a day and a half is not a problems!
8600	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	mike windsor	5	Here's looking at you and only then will it let you in	2019-06-24	uk	As with most apple products if your an apple fan it does what it says on the tin,very easy to set up. Arrived on time c/w sim tool,charger cable and USB plug uk everything so far seems to work, and work well. Comes unlocked so any network can be used.face recognition is pretty cool too.
8601	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Shelley	5	Easy to use a great phone	2019-03-25	uk	Upgrade from iPhone 6 with battery and other problems. This mobile is fast instinctive to use not too big and easy to transfer data via iTunes! As I am nearly 70 and managing technology easily and do not find the phone too large for small hands I am very happy with my choice and face recognition works really well
8602	iPhone XR	64GB	White	will	5	Great phone	2019-03-22	uk	Love it. After switching to android I had load of problems so switched back to apple and got the xr and have no complaints as of yet. Would recommend

8604	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Mark W.	5	A first-class phone	2019-04-05	uk	I took the plunge and upgraded from an iPhone 6 to the XR and I have not looked back!  It is a fantastic phone and despite being worried about moving away from fingerprint recognition, I love the facial recognition!!!  I wish I had upgraded sooner to be honest!  I have gone from needing a charge twice a day (or more) to one every three or so days and even then, just to get it back to 100%!

8612	iPhone XR	64GB	Blue	Joshua	4	Get xr	2019-03-11	uk	Coming from an android it’s hard to get use too, good phone over all but get the Xs not the xr. Battery last ages all day I used it as a gps for work but Face ID is a bit slow at times

8619	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Onyx	5	Best IPhone in Market. 10/10	2019-05-08	uk	Incredible value for money when up against the XS and XS Max, no big visual differences in Display or processing speed. The XR has the A12 Processor like the XS Max/XS so processing speed is the best you can get.

8622	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	C. Tempest	2	Disappointing build quality	2018-12-12	uk	The screen is great and face id works as well as touch id.It’s too big, the glass sandwich construction feels cheap (slippery with rough edges), and the camera bump is huge. If I drop it indoors I expect it to break.This is the first iPhone where I feel the design and build quality has taken a backward step.
8623	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	DT	4	Extremely good phone	2019-06-09	uk	Fast face recognition, excellent battery life (can easily go a whole day of heavy usage). Would recommend buying a case and screen protector for it though.

8630	iPhone XR	128GB	White	AD	5	"Great battery, big phone, turn on reachability."	2018-12-09	uk	Superb battery life! I no longer need to take my charger outside with me.The size took some time to get used to but enabling ‘reachability’ in the settings made it way easier. This allows you to swipe down on the home bar to bring down the top half of the screen.Apple should have left it on by default instead of making you turn it on by yourself. You can turn on reachability by going to settings > general > accessibility > reachability.
8631	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Carrotcruncher	5	Really great phone but probably a little overpriced	2019-01-07	uk	This is a great phone, the battery life is superb, the screen although just over 720 resolution is really good, putting it next to the 6s plus you really can’t notice any difference in face sometimes text actually looked a little better on the XR, the camera is also superb and really good in low light, it really makes shooting at night a pleasure, although some are saying it’s a downgrade I disagree, it is overpriced for what you get 599 would be a more realistic price, I got mine for that price thanks to a 150 quid voucher, even 650 would be a reasonable price but 750 is to much, unless of course you are rolling in cash in which case you would maybe buy the Xs plus, however that thing is huge, this phone at 6.1 inches is in the sweet spot as also the display is quite long the widths not much more that a 6s and it fits in the hand nicely and is nice to type on to without many typos, all in all a very nice phone and I am very very happy with mine
8632	iPhone XR	64GB	Coral	tactless (no tact)	2	"Too big, too thick, and too heavy."	2019-01-24	uk	⭐️ Screen — this actually looks fine. Visually, the phone is stunning 😍⭐️ Battery life — superb.The problem is the size and heft — It’s far too big and heavy.The front and back are glass.It's a very breakable glass sandwich!Swiping up from the bottom is very fluid — It’s buttery smooth and replicates what pressing the (missing) home button would do.Touch ID is still superior and more reliable than FaceID.
8633	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	John D Purley	5	Luxury iPhone Only Apple seem to get it so right!	2019-04-29	uk	I upgraded from an older iPhone 5s (which still runs all the apps I use but being in my 80s the small screen is now a bit of a struggle) so up from 4” to 6.1” and the XR is a beautiful upgrade in every respect.The A12 chip is about 5-6 times faster than the old 5S and has 200% more RAM, about 110% bigger screen area and with the 64gb version has about 50gb free space after system and apps etc. The stereo speakers are way above the anything you will find on the android phone and if like me you do not like using earphones this is a big bonus when listening to music or watching video etc.Face ID is a revelation!!! it was sharp and instant after setting up in the way required. I don’t miss the Home button at all. Just a flick of the finger takes you home, clears the screen of an app or brings back the apps you’ve been using and so no buttons to press at all. It automatically logs you in securely to websites and accounts et cetera. Everything about it is so smooth and slick compared to the android phones I have used and setup for others. At first I did baulk at the price over the iPhone 7Plus (5.5” screen) which will probably be discontinued this year with the arrival of iphone 11. Battery life of the XR has over the last few weeks of light use consistently delivered better than 2 days and photos are superb.  One criticism is the camera protruding from the case. This is not justified, see photoOverall, looking at the latest spec and what this includes, I think whilst it may be a luxury phone for me I have no regrets about spending the extra. The Apple combination of hardware and software clearly wins over other makers recipes in the use of Android.

8649	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Edward Lynch	4	A little too big for comfort	2018-11-23	uk	I’ve had my iPhone XR a week now and I’m missing my iPhone 7!  Face ID works really well, but I still miss fingerprint unlock on occasion - usually when the phone is flat on a desk and I have to move and lean over it to unlock.The thing I can’t get over is the size, especially in a case. It is just a bit too big to pocket and forget about, especially in Jeans or trousers.
8650	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	amageek	4	Heavy but all the best features	2019-04-04	uk	We all know apple products are overpriced and are often a little behind when compared with the competitor products, but I keep coming back to apple because it just works.iOS is dated in my view, but it does everything I need and it does it well and fast. The battery life is much better than on my IPhone 6 Plus. I play a lot of games on my phone and it still often lasts the day. My average screen time is around 7h.I wanted went for the XR because it has most of the nice features such as facial recognition (which works very well), a good camera and the same chip as the more expensive version. The battery life on this is supposed to be better than the other models but I only own the XR so can’t comment.It’s a bit thicker than I’d like and I would have liked the thinner bezels. Don’t understand why in this day and age apple are so far behind on the design, but for my purposes this phone is great. It is quite heavy though.  I do wish there was no notch either.I used to have an android phone and I’ve tried all the latest Samsung’s. Android OS is buggy and crashes a lot, and I’m not convinced about the security. I’ve got friends that just have to look at something and they are being sold and marketed to. The privacy settings seem better on apple.I do like the widgets on android though but I prefer the IOS versions of the apps which just seem to be smoother and work better.
8651	iPhone XR	128GB	White	Matt	4	Very good battery life and performance.	2019-04-07	uk	This is a great iPhone. The (close to) edge to edge screen is great for video and the stereo speakers are fantastic. Speakers are an area where Apple are really excelling in their mobile and laptop ranges. The LCD screen isn’t noticeably worse than an LED if you’re the type who dims it to save battery life anyway, which incidentally is better than any iPhone I’ve had in recent years. On low power mode, you could push it out for almost two days on light use. The camera is very good, although the portrait mode will look noticeably fake to any photographers who have shot with real low depth of field. It’s a shame this doesn’t have 3D Touch or a fingerprint sensor, but the phone still performs well. Build is great and as usual for a modern iPhone, it’s waterproof enough to survive most household accidents. But the compromises to make a cheaper iPhone means that unlike the thundering specs of iPhones like the 7 which beat most of the competition, there’s a lot of cheaper Android competition with a better spec on paper. Some much cheaper from the likes of Honor. If you’re agnostic as to which OS you like, shop around. But as an iPhone, I have no real complaints.
8652	iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	5	I think the beat iPhone so far and looks stunning	2019-02-20	uk	Just a quick rundown previous phones ,I had all iPhone till the 8plus and sold my iPhone XI wasn’t going to pay over 1000 for a phone so got the pixel 3 to try out,returned other than the photos the phone for me had bad battery and log of glitches,so got a deal on the car black 128 gb Absolutely love it in every way screen to me is excellent ,camera still really good and the battery less about 2 days seriously surprisingly great phone
8653	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	ken	5	Right sized iPhone!	2018-12-15	uk	I upgraded from the 7 plus. I don’t  fancy plus sized phones anymore. The XR is the right size for me. The XS was too small for my liking. The battery life is the best I’ve seen  in a smartphone. The screen even though had a lot of negative reviews prior to its release is actually good. I think the 128 GB has more value for money.

8663	iPhone X	256GB	Silver	MD007	1	Beware this may be a used phone pretending to be a new one	2018-12-30	uk	I would put a zero star rating if allowed.  I bought this a gift, only to find that during set up that the iPhone had already been owned by 2 other people with their IDs still hidden in the phone.  Apple support that nothing can be done to remove them from the phone without the password for those accounts - clearly that is never going to happen.  So I am now going to have to take this gift back and send it back to Amazon.  Hardly Christmas.  Completely unacceptable.
8664	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	TJ	4	"A solid phone, but an eyewatering price"	2018-10-19	uk	It's a truly great phone, at a grossly inflated price. You would be foolish if you didn't think a large amount of what you are paying for is branding. Yes - you do get a lot of tech with this. And I find that even though some other phones are technically superior the iPhone seems to run better HOWEVER this is nearly one thousand pounds. That is a big investment - more than a laptop. If you can afford it, it won't disappoint but it's defiantly not that much better than the older versions which are 2/3 of the price.
8665	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	George	5	It’s a legit unopened I Phone X.	2018-09-27	uk	When I ordered this I was a bit skeptical due to the reviews. It arrived earlier than expected. It’s a legitimate I Phone X, not a fake or refurbished one. It also comes with headphones and a charger.

8669	iPhone X	256GB	Silver	Wasim	5	Great phone at a decent price.	2018-09-18	uk	Purchased for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Arrived quickly and although it was a grade A used item, couldn't find a mark on it!12 month warranty gives peace of mind too.
8670	iPhone X	256GB	Space Grey	Kuisis	5	Absolutely beautiful	2019-01-17	uk	I'm really happy so far. The camera is stunning. The portrait mode is great with the dynamic blurring in the background, and the ability to take lowlight photos now makes me really happy.The battery life lasts more than a day with me watching netflix and prime video all day which is really surprising.The facial recognition is absolutely great. Cold weather + gloves, not a problem anymore! Touchless payments is also great to have if I forget my wallet at home. Haven't had a single issue so far. Very fluid OS.The ONLY nuance is if you want to listen to music or something and charge your phone, which you can't do unless you either buy a wireless charger or use bluetooth earphones. Or you risk it and buy a 3rd party adapter to charge and use earphones but I don't feel comfortable doing that.Really useful having the 256GB. Overall a happy customer :) and great experience from Amazon as usual. Delivered next day

8675	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Mike	5	Iphone X at a more acceptable price	2019-01-20	uk	Well pleased with my purchase at a more sensible price. The phone was never, in my view, worth the original asking price of £999. But still a excellent phone never the less. It is a brand new unit that so far has proven to be faultless. Delivered in real fast time too. You can find them a little cheaper, but this is a good buy.

8683	iPhone X	256GB	Silver	MD007	1	Beware this may be a used phone pretending to be a new one	2018-12-30	uk	I would put a zero star rating if allowed.  I bought this a gift, only to find that during set up that the iPhone had already been owned by 2 other people with their IDs still hidden in the phone.  Apple support that nothing can be done to remove them from the phone without the password for those accounts - clearly that is never going to happen.  So I am now going to have to take this gift back and send it back to Amazon.  Hardly Christmas.  Completely unacceptable.
8684	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	TJ	4	"A solid phone, but an eyewatering price"	2018-10-19	uk	It's a truly great phone, at a grossly inflated price. You would be foolish if you didn't think a large amount of what you are paying for is branding. Yes - you do get a lot of tech with this. And I find that even though some other phones are technically superior the iPhone seems to run better HOWEVER this is nearly one thousand pounds. That is a big investment - more than a laptop. If you can afford it, it won't disappoint but it's defiantly not that much better than the older versions which are 2/3 of the price.
8685	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	George	5	It’s a legit unopened I Phone X.	2018-09-27	uk	When I ordered this I was a bit skeptical due to the reviews. It arrived earlier than expected. It’s a legitimate I Phone X, not a fake or refurbished one. It also comes with headphones and a charger.

8762	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Dr. Jonathan S. Warren	5	A great improvement on my previous 6S	2018-03-31	uk	Was initially a bit wary as the price was significantly below the Apple price. Item delivered on time and brand spanking new. A great improvement on my previous 6S. I had considered buying in the USA but although with this retailer more expensive than in the USA much better than standard price in UK and it is 100% legit and no worries with customs!
8763	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Alison Callaghan	5	ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!	2018-03-11	uk	I’m very, very impressed with the iPhone X. I always thought my 6S Plus had a great camera but, my goodness, the camera on the X is amazing!Was a little unsure whether I’d manage the Face ID and missing home button but I honest had no problem with them, right from the start. The Face ID is excellent and even works in the dark or when wearing a hat/sunglasses etc.The difference In weight to my older 6S plus is unbelievable even though the screen is slightly bigger (the bezel takes my up much of the height on the previous edition) and I find it so much easier on my wrists.Battery life is far superior than previous modes and the biggest difference, for me, aside from the much-improved camera, is the clarity and colours of the display. Everything just pops on the X.I had previously seen reviews where the camera ‘notch’ had been annoying people. I can honestly say this hasn’t been a problem for me and the only kind of ‘complaint’ I have is that some app creators haven’t updated their apps to be used on the full screen X yet so you get some having a black bar at the top and bottom. Not much of a complaint but not as aesthetically pleasing as the apps which fill the entire screen.I would thoroughly recommend this phone if you have the budget!

8768	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Kenny Maciver	1	Two replacement iPhone X's in 2 weeks ; Big Unresponsive screen Issue	2019-01-21	uk	I got an iPhone x at Xmas but began using it two weeks ago. On the second morning 15 mins after taking it off the overnight charge, the phone froze with the little spinning wheel in the middle of the screen. It rebooted itself, a process that took 10 minutes. It did the same on the second, third and fourth day, then on the fifth it did not reboot and the screen was totally unresponsive. Calls would still come in and the phone would buzz but not ring but could not be answered. Took it back to Vodafone and they replaced it.The same thing happened with the replacement and Vodafone admitted that they were experiencing similar problems all over the place. In fact the call centre lady said they must have received a bad batch and she herself had just decided to go for an alternative to the iPhone X. I happened to be in London on Saturday and took my dud phone to the Apple store in Covent Garden. Technician ran diagnostics which showed a power failure and he admitted that they were having serious issues. he kindly replaced the phone there and then.It is now Monday and horror of horrors the little spinning wheel showed up this morning, with the phone rebooting itself. I guess it will happen again tomorrow and on Thursday/Friday it will be dead again, just like the other two.The brand is getting damaged. Very expensive phone to buy that has a major screen issue. Can still use it for accessing the internet on my iPad!! The good thing is that it gets replaced with no issues and I could now write the manual on how to transfer data across from my old phone. Come on Apple we deserve a better product for this price.
8769	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Abz	4	There’s no such thing as a PERFECT smartphone..	2019-05-25	uk	I have used every single iphone from the 4s, up to the x (my current daily driver). Ill briefly outline the pros and cons in my daily usage: Sound quality is stellar. Cant complain there, with dual speakers i find myself lowering the volume alot ! Screen brightness is blinding and vibrant in its highest set. Image quality is crisp and clear, as are photos taken with the dual lenses. Speed is phenomenal in any task thrown at the device. It does not lag or stutter! Its truly a powerhouse of a phone. Calls don't drop in my use, and call quality is brilliant, even on loudspeaker. For average users, 64gb is just right and a challenge to fill up. The build quality is premium and looks the price, with a gorgeous finish. The only negative issues are battery life (which is iphone standard) and the price. Its a very expensive device even today, which some may find difficult to justify.
8770	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Amazon Customer	1	Poor battery life	2018-07-06	uk	I haven’t even had the phone for two weeks and the battery goes flat very quickly, I have contacted the seller to return the phone and they will not respond. I have contacted Apple who told me that I have to contact the seller, and amazon told me I have to contact apple. It’s very unfortunate this has happened with me and I do not want to keep the phone. It’s best to buy straight from Apple.
8771	iPhone X	256GB	Space Grey	james cooke	1	Scam.	2018-06-07	uk	Thought I was buying an iPhone x but it came back a bag of pennies.. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
8772	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Mr Bee	3	Apple I.D. policy. 6 Owners max!	2019-03-05	uk	Please be aware that Apple has a maximum allowed owners on all phones. I think it is 6 email addresses. Once reached the phone is of no use whatsoever. I came accross this when trying to purchase a second hand phone and had to phone Apple to try and use it. Needless to say the phone was useless.
8773	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	B Newton	3	Great iPhone - but please read review for why it only gets 3 stars!	2018-01-24	uk	Great product, great iPhone, massive improvement on all the other models I’ve used. Fast and responsive, everything works great and Face ID is pretty amazing, saves time when using Apple Pay and logging into secure apps/websites.However... I had to return and get replacements for THREE iPhone X’s before I landed with one that didn’t have hair, dust or other foreign particles trapped on the inside of the glass covering the rear camera lenses. Yes, inside - no amount of wiping with a cloth will remove it as it’s under the glass. So, obviously a manufacturer defect where I assume it is not sealed in a dust and contaminant-free environment. Fourth iPhone replacement had nothing trapped under the glass and is perfect. For the cost of this product I don’t think you should expect anything less than perfection, so please do inspect your device thoroughly! :)

8783	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Dan	1	Don't own the phone but I troubleshoot tech for it	2018-08-15	uk	So I have only used the phone around work and messed with it and at face value it's a pretty decent smartphone. But I work for a mobile company on the phones doing tech support and I have never faced so many repairs and insane issues for a phone in my life. Motherboard overheating within a month, screen repairs being £280 with other damages up to £556, camera lens after camera lens cracking, iris scanner not working and if Apple can't repair your phone in warranty you don't even get a new one you get a refurbished one. Avoid this phone at all costs please, it is a waste of money just try an S9 out or even the new Huawei (Hew-Way) phones are doing it on par with less issues and less cost.

8786	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Ibraar	5	"WebOS reborn - the most beautiful, elegant, intuitive, user friendly, stable OS on the best hardware"	2017-11-17	uk	This is WebOS reborn and good riddance Home Button - after using this you won’t ever go back to such a clunky unintuitive way to do things again - WebOS was doing this in 2007 - with the X Apple has caught up at last and in doing so has left every other present (Android and iOS) offering left for dead.(Watch some YouTube videos of iPhone X and WebOS comparisons - remarkably similar - took Apple 10 years to catch up)I won’t much go over how gorgeous the hardware is - that’s evident.- I mean just look at it and handle it.I have the 64 GB silver - which is the most attractive version. The back of it glows - it’s beautiful to behold and wonderful to Handle and use - couple it with the Spigen Clear case - don’t hide the elegance and beauty - and those cases protect well using advanced materials for under £8. (In 5 years I’ve never damaged a phone when using the Spigen Clear).The screen is bigger than that of an iPhone Plus - but the handset is regular iPhone (6,7,8) sized - a tad bigger but hardly noticeable in the hand - and yes, unlike the iPhone Plus you can use this more or less one handed.The build quality is impeccable - it really is a premium device - the touch and feel - materials used -  the screen pops at you (the ‘notch’ has the cameras and is a design feature which reminds me of the bite taken out of the Apple - it differentiates your device from a common or garden Android cross breed) and the speakers are evidently louder and fuller with more range of sound and resonance than normal mobile phone speakers - so you can actually listen to music on it. (I wonder how the built in sound DSP DAC compares and fares in tests?)Battery life is the best I’ve seen on a  smartphone - a whole day of heavy use and by midnight I still had 40%.Reception and call quality again is as good as you can get.The hardware is gorgeous and coupled with the advanced internals you the have best handset on the market.But gorgeous hardware isn’t what makes a phone great - that’s the OS - and a modern OS should be user friendly, intuitive, beautiful to look at and a joy to use - it should also be fast and stable - so no annoying crashes or screen lock ups - this flies through every test and is a pleasure to use.Firstly Face ID - works more efficiently and more responsive than the finger sensor - works even in the dark and early morning with curtains shut and face screwed up - also effortlessly works with the browser, App Store purchases and other apps - and most apps have been updated to use this plus the gestures and screen of this iPhone X.The OS is a killer - the removal of the home button is a massive plus feature which turns a clunky device into magic - leaving any half baked  Android offering eating dust.iOS 11 on the iPhone X is WebOS 2017 - to think that Palm was so far ahead of its time - it built the most elegant and intuitive mobile phone OS back in the noughties - it’s give or take what the experience on the iPhone X is today.The iPhone X is beautiful to use intuitive  gesture based card system more of less as was WebOS - switching apps? Swipe across the bottom - closing apps? Gently touch and Swipe a card up  - switch apps? Swipe up and select the cards - and it multitasks properly - the camera and YouTube will run in card form (as on the WebOS TouchPad and Pre 3) - using every part of the screen to good effect - swipe from top right - from top or bottom reveals other features - and all fast responsive and with not a single crash or screen lock up in sight.I always hated the home button - coming from WebOS and HP Touchpad the iOS of the day was clunky and unintuitive - I noticed over the years how the iOS versions slowly morphed into what WebOS was - the morphing is complete with the dropping of the Hone Button and an adoption of an elegant intuitive card gesture based system which is a pleasure to use - the iPhone X is the best handset in the market and with the new iOS version it’s clearly the most beautiful intuitive elegant and user friendly - most stable and effortless OS on the market.A winner - thank you Apple and thank you Palm WebOS.
8787	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	tactless (no tact)	5	Amazing!	2017-11-12	uk	• BLACKS: blacks look properly black. Unlike LCD, they don't even light up the pixel.• HOME BUTTON GONE: you have to swipe up instead. I like this because it goes straight to the home screen, because while you're doing it, Face ID unlocks the phone in the background.• TO SWITCH APPS: just keep your finger on the screen after you swipe up. You get a subtle haptic feedback and then you get the apps presented to you as ""cards"".• NOTCH: It's actually tiny, and you really do stop noticing it.• CAMERA: optical stabilisation now also works on the telephone lens. It's superb.Overall, the phone is such a delight, you overlook the minor shortcomings:• COLOUR SHIFT: the whites seem blue-ish when you tilt the phone a bit. (Very slightly.)For people who are stuck in their ways: just get the iPhone 8. It has almost the same technology and you get to keep the home button. The iPhone 8 is still a great phone!• PRICE: It's very nice but i feel it's overpriced at £999 [Do not pay over £999 for the base model! I note that on this page they are taking the piss!]UPDATE 2018.05.02================• FaceID is a nice effort, but in my opinion nothing beats Touch ID 2 (as found on the iPhone 6 / 7/ 8).• I get that there's no room for Apple to put the TouchID sensor, due to reduced bezels.• It's annoying that the gestures are not now consistent between iPhone X vs iPad (& iPhone 7/8/SE)
8788	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Scotty	1	Why Apple?	2018-05-01	uk	The IPhone was doing well up untill the 6S and was beating Samsung but not any more...Apple are verry good business people and could stick there name on anything and people would still buy it like the Air Pods! See just buy removing the headphone Jack they want you to spend more of your money.The question you are wondering ""Is this phone really worth £1000?"" NO IT ISN'T!Here are the reasons why-1) It says it has the best display on a phone yet it isn't as good as Samsung displays from the S7 onwards. Even worse why did they cut some of the screen out for the notch when they should of just placed it above in all black so you atleast get the whole screen when you are watching videos.2/3) Crap Battery life compared to phones half the price of this! Also your gonna constanly need a power bank but that means you can't use headphone when charging so you will have to use bluetooth earphones that won't last as long as normal earphones.4) The dual Camera looks like a rubbish version of Wall-E5) It will slow down next year with an even worse battery meaning you will have to buy another £1000 Phone.If you have sense just don't buy it!

8790	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	thibo hernot	5	"Great deal, but be sure to check from where it's been dispatched.."	2018-08-23	uk	IMPORTANT! SELLER WAS: KOOKcommunicationSeller is excellent! I live in Belgium (europe) and therefore there were some things about the iphone ( it is a korean model, watch out for that) that dind't work as I wanted. Asian country's have a privacy law that states the shutter camera sound should always be on, that bothered my too much. But don't get me wrong! The iPhone was in perfect condition, everything in the original box and everything worked. U can perfectly use it in europe or elsewhere, i's just things like the shutter sound, if you're not bothered by it it's perfectly usable! The seller immediately offered a full refund and it's already on it's way back to the seller, perfect customer service!
8791	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Vasant kumar singh	5	Love it !!	2019-01-06	uk	Went for this over the new iPhone XS. Decided to not go with a contract so paid upfront. Feels solid in the hand, bigger and slightly heavier than my previous iPhone 8. Feel premium and butter smooth to operate. Face ID is quick and I don't miss the fingerprint mechanism a bit. Feels like you look at an app and it just opens. Can easily get a days worth screentime, as I am not a heavy phone user. Mainly for conference calls on Skype at work for which I use my phone and wireless earphones. Love with the display. It is just brilliant. Not overdone like the Samsung galaxy s9 my wife owns where it starts to feel unreal. Also pairs well with my Macbook Air as I have had both these devices since 2011, so couldn't really come out of the Apple eco system. All in all a good buy!
8792	iPhone X	256GB	Silver	Eddie	5	"Fantastic value, so stylish, love it"	2018-12-30	uk	I love it. Yes, it is pricey but it is an iPod, camera and photo album as well as phone all in one. Well, had to justify it to myself. But I do love it and it can do loads of clever stuff.....I keep discovering more...wowDo watch YouTube clips to work out how to save on using up data.....used loads at the start but now know how to turn off different modes and save data......a great learning tool too😊
8793	iPhone X	256GB	Space Grey	Jason basin	5	A great little find an upgrade to most previous iPhones	2019-01-01	uk	Very good phone upgraded from the iPhone 7 though the iPhone 7 is an extremely good versatile phone this is better in many ways although I was quite happy with my iPhone 7 it’s better for me because I had the 7+ and this is slightly smaller overall but slightly bigger screen seems a little bit faster and better touchscreen I would never buy android phone Ollie know if you can afford it then in my view I products are far superior to android in terms of reliability security and ease-of-use do I think it’s overpriced? Probably a little bit with all the crappy Chinese handsets out there do you really want to be hacked plus secondhand market is very attractive for an iPhone
8794	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Paul Dt11sz	5	Expensive	2018-12-22	uk	This phone was bought as a Christmas present for my daughter. No problem in transferring data from her 6s, I would say that Apple are easily the best phone on the market, but as all Apple products expensive, but that’s life
8795	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	K. Read	5	Great phone	2018-12-27	uk	I love this phone! It is a good step up from the IPhone SE which I had before. The screen and battery life are much better, facial recognition works real well and the camera is great - I love the profile setting which blurs our the background. The new headphone jack is a bit annoying, you have to use the apple headphones or Bluetooth ones, and you can’t charge the phone at the same time as listening via the wired headphones as they use the same jack. It is expensive but overall I would recommend it!

8823	iPhone X	256GB	Space Grey	Vitor Fernandes	4	Great phone but way overpriced	2019-02-20	uk	I got lucky to get this much cheaper than normal price, got a straight swap for my galaxy s9With that said, I would never pay over £500 for this phone, neither the galaxy s9 for that matterI have used almost all iphones since the 3gs, and Ive used a few xperias, and a few galaxiesPROS - Face id is the most unbelievable tech I've ever seen, its magic, it works, I've never had any face recognition on any device working before. The thing is crazy, it works in less than a second, from any angle, from any light condition, with or without my glasses, its actually quicker than the time it gets me to swipe to unlock the phone. To the point I had to double check it it was activated.- Display is nice, I love the true tone, but somehow I think the galaxy s9 display looks a bit better- A huge advantage over the s9, the auto brightness works perfectly, I never ever had to adjust it, it was the same with s9 until the new android 9 which was driving me mad, I had to adjust at least 5x per day.- I love that you don't accidentally press the edges when using- I love that you don't have a pointless bixby button, instead you get a very very useful sound off button- 256gb of internal memory is more than plenty, no need to buy an extra sd card- I like the form factor.DISADVANTAGES- I already miss the notification light- There is no way to remove the screen to the left of the home page- No always on display clock- Sound quality is not as good as S9, specially with quality headphones, which is even worse than my previous s8- No headphone jack, sorry apple but I don't do Bluetooth, I like audio quality- I hate that I cant choose how many rows of apps to have on the home screen, I don't need 6 rows, I don't even have that many apps on my phones- No USB-c, which is more common with many devices including Apples own laptopsAll in all, I'd say the X and the s9 are on the same level, galaxy because of audio, and iPhone because of face id.UPDATE - I just got an Xperia XZ, my 8th phone this year, and will be my last one too, finally I found the perfect phone, has way better audio than the iPhone X, has notification light, has headphone jack, SD card, dedicated 2way camera button, pictures look nicer once you chose 23megapixel in the options,  its more comfortable to hold and has nicer colours/display, has clearer voice call audio too, not to mention it cost 1/10th of the price of an iPhone X. It cost me 80 on ebay.
8824	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Scott Taylor	4	Great phone but not worth the money	2018-04-20	uk	I have had the iPhone X now for about 6 months and despite loving it, I regret buying it! Simply because of the cost.Whilst the phone feels great in the handle, offering a premium feel but in a palm friendly size the innovation from the iPhone 8 doesn’t justify the price. Sure you have Animoji, which I’ve used about 5 times but all in the first few days to show my kids. The only real innovation I feel is with the display and the face unlock. The display is good! Is it the best? No.. there are better out there but it is a big improvement of previous iPhones. Face unlock I do think is great, works everytime and I like the fact it works with pretty much all apps that would need fingerprint id. Apple Pay is a bit fiddly sometimes but most part ok. Apart from this it is just the same as any other iPhone!As for build quality... it’s great... BUT!! Definitely recommend a case as the frame of the phone scratches just by looking at itSave your money and get the 8 which is what I wish I’d done
8825	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Eolake	5	Real improvements.	2018-05-06	uk	So re how good is iPhone Ten... When I’d bought it, I was a bit hesitating about it when people asked me. I thought maybe I’d wasted my money a little.And I will say that I think that the only *dramatic* advantage is the size. A large screen on a much smaller phone than previously. I love that.But also, since then I’ve noticed things in comparison with my iPhone 6S+. It is actually quite noticeable improvements.One of them is the speaker. It is good enough to use to listen to podcasts and audiobooks when needed. On the 6, the bass is much more noisy, so male voices do not sound great at all, quite grating.Another, which I’d not seen coming, is the glass surface. I wonder how they have done it, but there must be some new treatment, because it is way less receptive to finger prints. I barely ever need to wipe it, it’s great. I wish my iPads had that surface.(I also wish all the devices had better anti-reflection coating, why don’t they?)Also, the colors and contrast of the screen are amazing. When the phone restarts in a dark room, I can cover the white Apple logo, and the black background is not visible!Also the camera is improved even beyond the addition of a “tele” camera (actually it’s a Normal lens, the old one is a clear wide-angle).  The only A/B test I’ve made is night-time video, but the X blew the 6 out of the water there.None of these are must-have for most people, but it is clear that a lot of work goes into improving everything on the phones, and I think goes a ways to justify the admittedly high price for the X.And as a side-note, I have no doubt that as a business tactic, the high price is the right thing for Apple. They have to position it as a premium product, and it would not seem so if it cost only the same as the previous phone.

Dispatched straight away and arrived the next day.The phone came just as described (purchased second hand) works perfectly, couldn't be happier.My previous phone was an iPhone 6, compared to the Iphone X is like night and day.

8829	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Luke	4	"Amazing phone, but..."	2018-01-16	uk	As much as I love the phone, the reason I drop it one star is because of Face ID, the price and the front camera. Genuinely overall coming from an iPhone 6, this has felt like a pretty decent step up, but it comes at a huge price. I won't go into all the positives, as the other reviews do this phone justice (speed, quality, back camera are all amazing). But I just want to point out things to be aware of if you're tossing up this phone against others.My main 'negatives' are:- Having had the phone for over a month, I don't think the price is justified - weighing up all the features etc. it does not do something revolutionary enough to justify the £999+ price tage- You need a case, and a good one at that! The phone is entirely made of glass, my friend has already broken a corner in less than a month - don't get a thin case, get a proper one if you want to actually protect it (also insurance)- Face ID is annoying, and you don't get used to it in a few hours, as I've seen mentioned. It doesn't always recognize your face, so it's a lot slower than fingerprint. It works perfectly when you're facing the phone directly (so when using Apple Pay or authorizing app downloads) but not great when you're lying down, have your phone on your desk or right below you etc.- And finally, the front camera is disappointing. Because the back one is so good, I expected the front one to have had massive improvements too, but it hasn't. I can barely notice a difference between the iPhone 6 and X front facing cameras.Having said all of this I would still recommend the phone to hardcore iOS users, otherwise if you can handle having a bigger handset, get the cheaper iPhone 8 Plus. The camera is just as good, screen too, and better value.

8832	iPhone X	256GB	Space Grey	PTZ	4	"The best iphone out there, but is it worth the asking price?"	2017-12-14	uk	Screen -This 1125 x 2436 pixel screen is very good. Very crisp and vibrant. .The maximum brightness level is very good. Makes it legible in sunlight .The size of screen is 5.8 inches diagonally.The famous ""notch"" in the screen is well talked about. I personally don't like it, but Apple have used it in a way where it does not obstruct your viewing pleasure.Build Quality-Very good. In par with the best. Non removable back. The lack of headphone jack carries on from the previous generation.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, specially for a phone. Not as powerful as the dual speakers of some other phones.But then its in par with the Samsung Galaxy S8 series and Iphone  8 plus.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag at all. Have not had any issues so far with sluggishness or re-starts etc. These phones have lesser RAM than the android counterparts, but this does not show in day today performance.Added features-Micro SD slot is not available to expand memory. This phone is water and dust (IP67) resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP DUAL lens back camera.Very good photos in good daylight. Very good low light photos, and no notable difference from the Samsung Galaxy S8 series. The front camera is good at 7MP, but could have been better(may be a front flash next time?) Good for selfies but nothing compared to the back camera.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good.However, if the phone fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon.Battery-Very good 2716 mAH battery. There is a quick charge function as well as wireless charging. But this is not as fast as the dash charge in One plus 3s /One plus 5. This is definitely faster than the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 / Galaxy S8 though.You may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one day of use on this, if you are a casual user.Operating System-Runs iOS 11.1.1 System is slick and easy to use.Security features-Facial recognition- fast and slick, but still needs improvement.Colour-Comes in black and ceramic on the back. I like the ceramic better, since it gives a unique look.Single or dual sim?This only come in a single SIM version.Is there anything else I would have wished the iphone to have?1. Stereo speakers2. fingerprint scanner placement (inbuilt to the screen)3. Bigger screen4. Bigger battery and faster quick charge functionShould you buy S8 /S8+ over this ?its a personal choice. The S8 would be cheaper at this point. Otherwise both phones have similar functionality. But honestly, wait for the S9 if you are in doubt, it's probably just 3 months away.This, or the Iphone 8 plus?If you want the latest and the greatest, go for this. I personally prefer this to the Iphone 8.Price-At £999, this is one of the priciest phones out there.I personally feel this is overpriced for what it is, hence 4 stars. £899 would have been a better price point. The Iphone retains a lot of resale value though. This time next year you could probably sell it for around £500.When buying through third parties look at the following-Is it new or used?Are they locked/unlocked?Has it got a decent warranty (most of the time, Apple does not cover phones bough through third parties) ?Do you get all original accessories with box?

8834	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Nutter	3	Disappointed	2018-01-20	uk	The previous Griffin cases I had were a rubber type thing this is hard plastic. I can look past that. Fitting has some benefits over previous models where dog hairs seemed to manage to get under the screen cover. ButAnd this is a massive butThe buttons need so much pressure to push them. The off button takes both hands and I’m far from weak.The cover for the charge port is very hard to get open and even harder to close.I’m sure it adds to the water resistance but it’s majorly impacting usage.I’d return it but I don’t know who else’s to buy
8835	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Am@z0n Cust0m3r	5	Great expensive phone!	2018-02-26	uk	You think the price is high but what you get is worth every penny!!!!! The pictures are better than 35mm camera with zoom lensThe X model looses the Home Button and doesn’t have a the headphone jack like the 7’s. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.If you can afford it, you will be happy.The Face ID works really well. This is the first of what will be new technologies for Apple like the Face ID, this was probably rushed and the next version will be more secure and work better. But it seems to work fine right now and does take the place of the finger ID pretty well.Camera takes awesome pictures.Pleased so far and looks like a solid reliable phone. The main thing I like is the larger screen which is gorgeous and the faster processor. I love the phone but honestly I could have waited a year for the next model. If you can afford it now you’ll enjoy it. The size is perfect for me and the screen is awesome.Get a good case to protect it with which also hide the gorgeous design. I never really saw the iPhone 7 in black that I had because I always had it in a heavy duty case to protect it. It’s a shame to hide such great looking devices but you kinda have to so they don’t get dinged up.
8836	iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Ryan Knight	3	Lovely looking phone that burns its screen	2018-06-18	uk	Good phone that Apple needed to release! It's the 'newness' that creates the hype for this device but it has one major flaw: it's screen. Yes, the SCREEN can, and will, eventually suffer from 'burn-in,' which is a permanent ghosting effect of picture elements that remain or ""burn"" into the screen thus creating an unsightly look - see pics that I took of the phone from a very popular phone shop...I've seen a good number of these iPhone X's with burni-in.Here are the phone's good & bad points...POSITIVES:+ Good camera = great photos+ Great build quality, with a design & fit for a great feel in the hand+ Good sound from stereo speakers+ Reliable connectivity for WiFi, Bluetooth & mobile data+ The phone is waterproofNEGATIVES:- No Home Button, which takes some getting used to- Gestures can be a bit confusing at first & can be executed by accident- Face ID a bit cumbersome at times & not 100% reliable when wearing sunglasses- (Still) no expandable storage via micro SD card- AMOLED screen suffers from BURN-IN after a while. Sure it looks beautiful but hey check my photosSo, if one likes to keep their screen at full brightness they will eventually see screen elements (icons or text) permanently 'burnt' into the screen. Give it 18 months or more & sure enough, issues will arise.BOTTOM LINE: a great phone ruined by an OLED screen (when it burns in)I WOULD NOT recommend this phone to people who keep their phone/s longer than 24 months.However, I WOULD recommend this phone to people who upgrade their phone every 12 to 18 months, as chances are the screen will still look great 👍

8838	iPhone X	256GB	Silver	Farooq	5	Perfect choice.	2019-07-12	uk	I always wanted an iPhone X as upgrade from iPhone 7 and this one did perfect.  Really liked the display and design of this iPhone.  Bigger than the one I had and a better camera.
8839	iPhone X	64GB	Silver	TheMC	4	Apple pay and face recognition aren’t smooth.	2019-05-07	uk	I switched back to iPhone after trying a OnePlus, which was amazing but too big for me (and the sound quality not as good).The iPhone X is a perfect sized phone for my small hands. The mic / sound recording (with and without the original earphones) is the best I’ve seen on any phone.I’ve dropped it quite a lot and it has yet to break (I have a sticker on it and a screen protector but no silicone case).I would say if you use the camera and mic a lot, it is worth the bucks, as is my case.However, if you don’t, I’m not sure it is. Androids are much more customisable, google pay is a lot smoother than apple pay (if you double press the power button it comes up, so I keep doing it accidentally, and takes more time to do it deliberately when trying to pay, vs androids let you do it with just a touch). The face recognition is nowhere near as good as my old OnePlus’, and you still have to swipe up, so it’s never a truly hands free experience as the OnePlus is. Also there’s no fingerprint scanner so if it doesn’t recognise you, you have to type your code in.In summary, I’d say it’s a good phone if you have the same priorities as me. If not, androids are a lot more fun and customisable (and cheaper).
8840	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	Cliente Amazon	5	delivered in time and actually Apple so very happy with it as it is cheaper than on their ...	2018-05-19	uk	I was initially a bit wary of buying it through Amazon as I didn't know Apple would sell their products outside of their own website and cheaper, unless it was a phone company such as Vodafone or Three. I got my phone back in February, everything ok, delivered in time and actually Apple so very happy with it as it is cheaper than on their own website. From now on I will probably buy it on Amazon if the price difference persists.

8842	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver	SPARTAN-047	5	"Excellent and smooth performance, good for those who don’t want upgrades."	2019-04-19	uk	Replaced my Sony Xperia XA1 with this and I won’t look back. I loved the Apple ecosystem from the MacBook and Handoff is a very useful feature. The integration of iOS and macOS is hard to match.The battery life seems to be less than the iPhone 7 which I also purchased so I had to keep charging it in at least half a day with how much I use it. It’s not a huge deal as I got a power bank too. But it’s a bit annoying.Performance by the bionic A11 chip is amazing. I don’t play mobile games but everything I opened and closed felt like butter. It can handle all the apps I open and more without a stutter, so performance isn’t anything to sneeze at. Mobile gamers might have a different experience but the specs are rocking.The other requirements of the phone are for heavier phone users, but it ought to be fine. I use the iPhone XR now and FaceID feels better and smoother, more intuitive, but the TouchID is still excellent as used on my iPad.
8843	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver	Guozhu Liu	5	Phone	2019-03-17	uk	The duration of battery is ideal and you can play a whole day, but there are no other differences between iPhone 8 and iPhone 6s
8844	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Mrs S M Richardson	5	iPhones are great - and this was a great price	2019-03-03	uk	A lot of people already know that iPhones are great. I chose this one because the upgrade differences we just up on my 6 - but not up enough to pay a full price for a X? Arrived very quickly - all safe & sound 😀 Although did choose Amazon to buy it through just in case we had any problems, and needed to claim anything back? But no need to have worried.
8845	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver	Dr Mikaela Smit	5	Fantastic	2019-02-20	uk	Great price (much lower than apple/john lewis etc). Genuine, works like a charm.

Has had a couple of moments but overall it has been very good so far. It's smaller than my last phone and some things are less intuitive. So far I'm pretty happy with it. The biggest downside so far is the inflated price and that's what limits the value of it.

The only thing I would say is that it took a long time to first turn on (about 20 mins) as the battery was completely dead. I’m presuming this is because it’s been sat in a warehouse for a long time. No issues with it now, it’s a great phone. Also was delivered about 5 days quicker than the estimated delivery.

8888	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	P0PE	3	Hmmmm	2018-05-25	uk	Nice.Found a discount on amazon on it and had another discount so got this really cheap. And To get Iphone with a discount is impossible. Phone is perfect but the delivery was horrible, if I weren’t an honest person I would have got a free iPhone from them. I arrived home to my apartment and found my phone near outside door half open with phone visible just dumped like that. Wrote a nasty complaint about it.
8889	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	DK	1	Just no good.	2019-03-11	uk	It started off working OK, but within hours the screen locked and the 'waiting circle' log in the middle of a black screen kicked in....and ran for 12 hours during which time I couldn't do anything - no restart/shutdown option. So it is going back. Very disappointed in Apple, I thought that their product quality was one thing you could depend on! I was switching back to Apple as I couldn't get on with Android (Samsung).  So where do I go now?  Maybe I will just get a dumb-phone (Nokia) - I used to like the one I had in the 90s.

8900	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	Kyriakos Zaritis	4	In-depth review of iPhone 8	2017-11-08	uk	Another year has passed and a new iPhone (well this time three to be precise) has been released. This review will look at the iPhone 8 in-depth and rate it in a few main categories, such as display, camera, etc. At the end, there will be a summary that will include the advantages and disadvantages spotted and my personal opinion on whether you should upgrade depending on your current iPhone model (if you wish to just see a brief overview, please skip to the end).DESIGN 8/10Ever since the iPhone 6 was released, the design of the iPhone has more or less stayed the same. This isn’t necessary a bad thing as when you first pick up the new iPhone, you will be shocked by how familiar it looks, but it is slightly frustrating that they could not be a little more inventive and switch up the design of the phone. The main change is that the front and back are glass (reminiscence of the iPhone 4/4s) and an aluminium frame “stitches” the two pieces of glass together. It’s cool and beautiful, but we’ve been seeing something similar for 4 years now. As a consequence of using glass for the front and back of this phone, you will notice that it is slightly heavier (at almost 150g) which makes it not only less slippery but gives it a more premium feel to the device and is also less likely to attract fingerprints (due to its oleophobic coating). This year’s iPhone has rolled out in only three colours for the standard and plus models: space grey, silver and gold.DISPLAY 8/10It’s exactly the same with the display of this phone, as it has been “recycled” for what feels like forever. The 4.7 inch Retina LCD display has a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch which is good, but the same as older models. However, this model has a wider colour and brighter display, but this isn’t new as it was also in last year’s iPhone 7. The only difference between the display of the iPhone 8 and ANY older model is the True Tone display which adjusts the display in terms of white balance, brightness and colour temperature, depending on your environment. Pretty cool.OS AND SPECS 10/10The iPhone 8 comes out of the box with the latest iOS 11 and despite being quite buggy when it rolled out, it now runs fantastically smooth. This device is future-proof as it will receive all OS updates for the next 3-4 years. Apart from that, another reason why this smartphone is future-proof is its specs. It has a hexa-core Apple A11 processor which is Apple’s latest and currently the market’s greatest (Benchmark scores can confirm this). It also has 2GB of RAM which is enough for an iPhone to run smoothly and two internal storage options of either 64GB/256GB. My personal opinion is to go with 64GB and save a bit of money as it is more than enough memory for the average user/consumer.CAMERA 10/10Despite being identical on paper to last year’s, the new iPhone outperforms its predecessor in the camera department. It’s a single lens 12MP camera with an aperture of f/1.8, autofocus and a quad-LED flash. It’s as excellent as it is every year with improved quality and detail, especially in low-light conditions. Colours are more vibrant and objects/people look more accurate than ever. The iPhone 8 can shoot 4K video which is awesome and surprisingly stable (it does have OIS) and professional for a phone. The front camera has 7MP with an an aperture of f/2.2 and a Retina Flash and selfies look clear and smooth.BATTERY 9/10The iPhone 8 has a smaller battery than the 7, yet still manages to slightly last longer due to it’s excellent optimisation. The new iPhone has a non-removable 1,821mAh battery which lasts a full day of heavy usage. However, competition has been pushing the boundaries in terms of power and the new Samsung Galaxy smartphones can last two entire days of moderate/heavy usage! Still, let’s be thankful that Apple is slowly making progress in this department and have even implemented wireless charging. Wireless charging is a cool feature but, due to being unbearably slow and charging only 15% in 30 minutes, I prefer conventional cable charging. This phone does have quick charge but you do have to buy a different cable and plug from the Apple Store which is honestly pretty disappointing! Especially considering EVERY brand that offers quick charge, offers it without if’s or but’s (having to buy additional cables).EXTRAS 8/10Not much to say about additional features as almost everything is similar to last year’s. It’s IP67 water-resistant at 1m for 30 minutes. It does include NFC but, as always, can only be used for Apple Pay. However, it does include Bluetooth 5.0 (although there aren’t many Bluetooth 5.0 accessories just yet) and stereo speakers, which are the loudest on an iPhone.OVERALL 8/10Like every year, this is an impressive new iPhone with additional features. It’s familiar and lightning fast with an incredible camera that outshines its predecessors. This phone, despite its bezels, does feel futuristic as it is Apple’s first attempt at a fully wireless smartphone. In theory, this phone has completely eliminated the need to use any ports for charging or listening to audio and although Android has done it first, Apple is forcing us to make use of the wireless technology out there… And I guess, we don’t really have any other choice.PROS +Beautiful, all-glass design+True Tone display+Lightning fast processor+Incredible camera, even in low-light+Good battery life+Instant unlocking through fingerprint sensor CONS-Similar design to previous three models-Need to buy additional accessories for quick/wireless charging-NFC only available for Apple Pay-Still only IP67Coming from an iPhone 7? Major additions: wireless charging, double storage options, True Tone display, glass design, slightly better battery. In my opinion, you should not update unless you always buy the latest and greatest, or you are a photographer/blogger (in which case, buy the plus version). This is because there are not enough major changes from the model you already own and I personally think it’s a waste of money but go ahead if you want to.Coming from an iPhone 6s or older? Yes, definitely update. There are more than just a few additional features, you will not regret this.

As I use the headphone jack more than most, it renders my irig guitar interface useless.. which I’m not best pleased about. But there are improvements in terms of speed etc.

8906	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver	P. Henderson	5	Fantastic!	2019-07-02	uk	Bought from Amazon Warehouse. Described as Good Condition so was a bit wary what it might look like.  It arrived in it's own box with charger and head phones. It is like NEW condition. I can't see anything wrong with it. Perhaps packaging had been opened previously. Much cheaper than buying new. Very pleased with it.Upgraded from iphone 5 to this iphone 8 and there's a big difference. Good sized screen. Nice, slim body.  Great features. Very easy to move sim card from old to new phone and instant set-up with all my contacts, history etc.Delighted with this phone.

8909	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	hodges	5	early days	2019-04-12	uk	firstly the new mobile cloned my old mobile (strange in my mind)  and not actually using it in full the battery life appears to be less than my original well used mobile (earlier version of 8)
8910	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	RichT	1	Silly money	2018-10-31	uk	I bought this as a gift for my son who wanted an iPhone because of peer pressure. My phone (S8) is way better and less than half the price!

8912	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	Tahira	5	Perfect	2019-02-27	uk	I thought it was a little expensive as it wasn't the newest model.  But other than that it was pefect and brand new.  I was wondered how to insure it against theft..
8913	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	AJN	5	Convenient for the trouser pocket	2018-12-15	uk	I only use it for general UK calls, not overseas calls. It works well and, in its case, fits comfortably in my trouser pocket. Larger models would not have fitted so well. The camera is much better than that on my previous 5s model

8922	iPhone 8	256GB	Silver	Katherine R	2	overheating iphone8	2018-07-06	uk	Unfortunately despite the phone being brand new and in excellent shape, once i charged and set it up, the phone overheated immediately and was shocked at just how hot it was and it hadn't even been used yet! It would and could be seriously dangerous and a fire hazard to leave it in a room without keeping eye on it.  Pointless to have a phone that will be too hot to hold, use or keep in a handbag.
8923	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Elena	5	Great customer service	2018-08-26	uk	I’m very pleased with my phone. I have the rose gold 8. It arrived earlier than expected and it was brand new and unopened. After a couple months I noticed there was a tiny dot moving around on my camera lense and I ended up having the camera replaced at the Apple store. This was covered by the warranty so I wasn’t charged at all. The seller was in contact with me during the whole process and checking that everything was alright. I have had no other problems with this phone.
8924	iPhone 8	64GB	Silver	D Mathis	5	Superb Phone !!!	2018-04-11	uk	PROS:1: FAST, Smooth operating system.2: Stylish Glass Back & Wireless Charging.3: Fantastic Front & Rear Camera.4: The NEW Vibrating Button Design feels great under your finger ... ( & i really didn't think id like the new design idea but i love it )5: Waterproof.CONS:1: NoneI'm not a fan of Face iD Recognition or the design of the iPhone X, so i bought the best apple iPhone on the market that still uses the touch iD technology & this is it.
8925	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	Jollybusman	5	Very impressed	2018-01-19	uk	Very impressed with the screen size and its clarity. I've just upgraded from the 5s to this 8 and I'm really pleased I did. Fantastic phone with lots of extra features. Also very impressed by the battery life and speed of charging. Battery lasts much longer than my old phone that I was needing to charge st least every other day. This lasts me around 3-4 days depending on how much I use it and will fully charge from around 15% to 100% in around 2 1/2 hours.  Also much cheaper, by hundreds of pounds, to buy outright than have it on a contract, especially as I always forget to cancel at the right time and end up over paying for 6 months or so.  If you can't afford it outright, see if you can get an interest free credit card and pay it off in the free months, that's if you're disciplined enough not to spend on it, lol.

8935	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Mr. M. Platt	5	SUPERB PHONE.......NO LONGER JUST A PHONE BUT A MINI HAND HELD IPAD WHICH CAN BE USED ANYWHERE	2017-12-10	uk	Having used this phone now for almost 2 months I can say it's superb.  The only downside appears to be the speed at which the battery loses its power.  Also if purchasing the excellent Caseology iphone case, be sure not to accidentally push down the mute button on the side.  Basically, this is no longer a phone, it is a miniature computer/ipad.  The 'Touch ID' facility is amazing and allows me to access my Nat West account within seconds and move money around.  It is without doubt an amazing piece of kit.  Buy the Caseology case for it to show it off at its best.

8940	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Ana Jimenez	5	Recommendable	2017-12-24	uk	About the phone, I would say that changing from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone 8 is totally worth it. From the camera to the performance, you can absolutely tell the difference.About the seller, I bought my iPhone 8 from A-Mountain, and I admit that I had many doubts, but after all I cannot complain. At the beginning it was said they didn’t have stock, but the day after it changed and was delivered. Then my package arrived on time and everything was okay. I asked for the invoice and got it very fast as well. It’s an original new iPhone, working well, and at a very good price. I recommend!
8941	iPhone 8	64GB	Gold	Amazon Customer	1	SCREEN DAMGED AND CAMERA	2018-07-08	uk	I got and it was rubbish the screen was broke and so was the camera.And the bad thing is that now I can return it what a waste of my moneyI’m applaud I want a new one now!
8942	iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	Mystified Mister	3	"It's a quality product, but I wouldn't recommend it."	2017-11-28	uk	Here's a few of my feelings after using this phone for a week.- The 'fake' home button works well, but it doesn't feel as nice to use as an actual home button, and it made me realise for the first time how much better an iPhone without a home button would be (If only the iPhone X was a simdge less expensive...).- The camera takes really detailed and good-looking pictures, and can eeeasily replace a point and shoot camera. The dynamic range is a bit iffy at times, but other than that it's great. I couldn't care less about the lack of 2x optical zoom, especially when it doesn't have image stabilization like on the iPhone 8 plus.- Sadly the battery life isn't anything to boast about, but even worse is how bloody long it takes to charge this thing. Apple, being Apple, doesn't give you their latest fast charging tech in the box, so you're stuck in the slow lane until you inevitably splash out for the newer charger. What annoys me the most is how painfully long it takes to get from 95% to 100%!- 4.7 inches eh? Perfect size you say? Well, no. Franky it's too small of a screen to be really immersed in any sort of media you're watching or playing, but at the same time, it's just too big to use comfortably one handed (unlike the iPhone SE). I will say that unlike it's bigger brother, the 4.7-inch iPhone is far more comfortable in the pocket. But both the iPhone SE and iPhone X will also be comfortable in your pocket, yet these phones offer the advantages of one-handed use and a far more immersive display respectively.- I got the space grey model. Under the right light, and when there's no fingerprint marks on the phone, the iPhone 7S, I mean 8, looks stunning. Absolutely beautiful. But these conditions are rare, and more often than not the glass back looks more messy than classy. To anyone deciding between the two non-female-exclusive colours,  space grey and silver, I actually recommend you go for silver. Reason being, fingerprints on it won't be nearly as noticeable, and the milky colour on the back of the phone is far more interesting and unique. Plus you get a silver ring around the home button which is pretty neat, and actually quite useful when you need to locate the home button in low light situations.- iOS 11 looks fantastic, especially the new control center. However it's so full of bugs on the iPhone 8. For example after being in a landscape app for a while and returning to the home screen (holding the phone in portrait), the notification/control center tabs remain accessible by swiping from the sides of the phone instead of the top and bottom. Not very polished at all.

It does everything you're likely to need. Phones sure have come a long way.

8975	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Gold	Helene	5	Brilliant phone though I haven’t yet opened the one I bought from this company.	2018-03-12	uk	Oops, I thought I was writing about the screen shield: This is a backup phone I bought but I haven’t yet tried it as I am waiting for my SIM to arrive. Nevertheless my main phone is also an iPhone 8 plus and I can say I immediately fell in love with it. This is the best Apple product I had in my hand in years. For those wearing hearing aids, you can pair them to the phone and use the phone as a hearing aid by placing it some where in a room when you would normally struggle to hear. I have been told the advance for the sight disabilities are equally impressive. This is absolutely a brilliant phone.
8976	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Grey	Mrs Ruth Farnsworth	3	Three Stars	2018-02-13	uk	Great phone, like new, but no earphones, box or charger.
8977	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Space Grey	Cameron F.	5	Does exactly what is needed	2019-01-01	uk	I purchased my iPhone 8 plus on release day 2017 upgrading from a normal iPhone 7. Visually there is little difference between the iPhone 7 generation + the iPhone 8 generation however don't let this put you off. The display visual does seem a little bit better then previous generation and so does the camera. The battery life is by far a lot better then my iPhone 7 ever was, coming on a year and 3 months old my phone still lasts a day and a half with normal use .e.g. texts, phone calls, using as torch and photos however using my phone looking at social media or videos and music this is lowered to about a days worth of charge, however this still beats all previous generation battery life especial at the age it is now when that usually starts to drop. I personally have made the decision not to upgrade from this for the foreseeable future as it does exactly what I require of it and the camera is very good and the storage capacity is excellent. My conclusion on this phone is mixed however the reason for this is if you have a iPhone 6 or older then I would recommend the upgrade to the 8, however if you have the iPhone 7 I recommend skipping this generation as there is not enough change to justify upgrading to this. Now I get to the point why should or would people buy the iPhone 8 when they can get the 2018 models well the truth is a phone is a phone for its age this is very advance and this also comes with a lot smaller price tag so if you are not someone who needs to have all the latest gadgets I would recommend buying this generation for the time being.

Camera superb, not Galaxy sharp but one of the best.
8985	iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Space Grey	kai stenning	4	a very good phone	2018-05-15	uk	Another year has passed and a new iPhone (well this time three to be precise) has been released. This review will look at the iPhone 8 in-depth and rate it in a few main categories, such as display, camera, etc. At the end, there will be a summary that will include the advantages and disadvantages spotted and my personal opinion on whether you should upgrade depending on your current iPhone model (if you wish to just see a brief overview, please skip to the end).DESIGN 8/10Ever since the iPhone 6 was released, the design of the iPhone has more or less stayed the same. This isn’t necessary a bad thing as when you first pick up the new iPhone, you will be shocked by how familiar it looks, but it is slightly frustrating that they could not be a little more inventive and switch up the design of the phone. The main change is that the front and back are glass (reminiscence of the iPhone 4/4s) and an aluminium frame “stitches” the two pieces of glass together. It’s cool and beautiful, but we’ve been seeing something similar for 4 years now. As a consequence of using glass for the front and back of this phone, you will notice that it is slightly heavier (at almost 150g) which makes it not only less slippery but gives it a more premium feel to the device and is also less likely to attract fingerprints (due to its oleophobic coating). This year’s iPhone has rolled out in only three colours for the standard and plus models: space grey, silver and gold.DISPLAY 8/10It’s exactly the same with the display of this phone, as it has been “recycled” for what feels like forever. The 4.7 inch Retina LCD display has a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch which is good, but the same as older models. However, this model has a wider colour and brighter display, but this isn’t new as it was also in last year’s iPhone 7. The only difference between the display of the iPhone 8 and ANY older model is the True Tone display which adjusts the display in terms of white balance, brightness and colour temperature, depending on your environment. Pretty cool.OS AND SPECS 10/10The iPhone 8 comes out of the box with the latest iOS 11 and despite being quite buggy when it rolled out, it now runs fantastically smooth. This device is future-proof as it will receive all OS updates for the next 3-4 years. Apart from that, another reason why this smartphone is future-proof is its specs. It has a hexa-core Apple A11 processor which is Apple’s latest and currently the market’s greatest (Benchmark scores can confirm this). It also has 2GB of RAM which is enough for an iPhone to run smoothly and two internal storage options of either 64GB/256GB. My personal opinion is to go with 64GB and save a bit of money as it is more than enough memory for the average user/consumer.CAMERA 10/10Despite being identical on paper to last year’s, the new iPhone outperforms its predecessor in the camera department. It’s a single lens 12MP camera with an aperture of f/1.8, autofocus and a quad-LED flash. It’s as excellent as it is every year with improved quality and detail, especially in low-light conditions. Colours are more vibrant and objects/people look more accurate than ever. The iPhone 8 can shoot 4K video which is awesome and surprisingly stable (it does have OIS) and professional for a phone. The front camera has 7MP with an an aperture of f/2.2 and a Retina Flash and selfies look clear and smooth.BATTERY 9/10The iPhone 8 has a smaller battery than the 7, yet still manages to slightly last longer due to it’s excellent optimisation. The new iPhone has a non-removable 1,821mAh battery which lasts a full day of heavy usage. However, competition has been pushing the boundaries in terms of power and the new Samsung Galaxy smartphones can last two entire days of moderate/heavy usage! Still, let’s be thankful that Apple is slowly making progress in this department and have even implemented wireless charging. Wireless charging is a cool feature but, due to being unbearably slow and charging only 15% in 30 minutes, I prefer conventional cable charging. This phone does have quick charge but you do have to buy a different cable and plug from the Apple Store which is honestly pretty disappointing! Especially considering EVERY brand that offers quick charge, offers it without if’s or but’s (having to buy additional cables).EXTRAS 8/10Not much to say about additional features as almost everything is similar to last year’s. It’s IP67 water-resistant at 1m for 30 minutes. It does include NFC but, as always, can only be used for Apple Pay. However, it does include Bluetooth 5.0 (although there aren’t many Bluetooth 5.0 accessories just yet) and stereo speakers, which are the loudest on an iPhone.OVERALL 8/10Like every year, this is an impressive new iPhone with additional features. It’s familiar and lightning fast with an incredible camera that outshines its predecessors. This phone, despite its bezels, does feel futuristic as it is Apple’s first attempt at a fully wireless smartphone. In theory, this phone has completely eliminated the need to use any ports for charging or listening to audio and although Android has done it first, Apple is forcing us to make use of the wireless technology out there… And I guess, we don’t really have any other choice.PROS +Beautiful, all-glass design+True Tone display+Lightning fast processor+Incredible camera, even in low-light+Good battery life+Instant unlocking through fingerprint sensorCONS-Similar design to previous three models-Need to buy additional accessories for quick/wireless charging-NFC only available for Apple Pay-Still only IP67

8998	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Silver	Andreas Patsalos	5	An honest review.	2018-09-02	uk	The most powerful phone I’ve ever had. I was looking to ipgrade from my 7 non-Plus because I couldn’t bare woth the relatively small display (4.7 inch) any more and after a long research, this will be my phone for the next at least 5 years.I was comparing to the X and to what’s going to be released this September as well and it won for me by a long shot.It has a 16:9 display, the natural resolution of YouTube. The X and the new ones are 19:9 and videos in YouTube are a little zoomed which is annoying. Also, it has the most beautiful LCD I’ve seen on a phone. The OLED on the new ones is a no for me because of the chance it has to get burn marks. Also, its wider display is awesome for my big hands. Its screen is 5,5 inch while the X is 5,8 but you see way more conent on the 8 Plus.Second, the Touch ID. Much faster and accurate than Face ID at the moment. Face ID is the future but in my opinion it’s currently in a beta state.Third, moving away from the differences between this and the new ones, is its battery. I get absolutely INCREDIBLE battery. It’s no way compared to my 7. I tinkered my settings after watching various YouTube videos and I LOVE my battery time. Easily 3 days with moderate use.Fourth, the camera. Oh god what a camera. Again, nothing like my 7’s. Crisp clear and the portrait mode is AWESOME. With some tips I’ve seen on the internet about taking photos, my photos look like professional ones now.Lastly, compared to androids, the fact that I get updates, both OS ones and security ones, instantly is a huge plus. With android phones, if you don’t own a Google Pixel phone, you must wait in line to get any updates, and the wait time is longer depending on the manufacturer. Also, owning a variety of Apple and Android phones, I’ve found out that my Apple phones last WAY longer than android ones. My 5S for example is still blazing fast. Apple does care about their old phones. You can see that woth iOS 12 coming out and boosting the performance of the old phones by a HUGE.
8999	iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Grey	DavidAlan1988	5	I was a long term android user.	2018-07-14	uk	I’ve been using android and pretty much nothing else but since 2010. So I’d just like to say that if your thinking of making the switch, do it.The iPhone 8 Plus is an expensive way to start, but the one thing I didn’t want to do was downsize my screen. Coming from a huawei p10 Plus I was used to a very quick phone. The 8 Plus is just as quick through general navigation and use I’d say, but blows gaming away with not only the A11 chip but just how well games are optimised on iOS. The device oozes quality but I will say you definitely want to look after it. A good case is a must as well as a decent screen protector (plenty of both on Amazon).What’s it like as a phone? Calls are great. Very clear calls every time. Texting? This was an annoyance for me on android because even third party keyboards for me are not as good as the stock iOS keyboard. I can confidently type with my eyes closed now and mistakes are very few and far between.The camera(s)? The dual 12mp setup on the Plus is more than capable of taking brilliant snaps worthy of printing and sharing. I can’t tell if it’s down to the true tone display or the camera but pics do appear a little on the warm side. Nowhere near as harsh as the likes of a galaxy s9 though.Making the switch... Android is a great mobile OS for a lot of reasons. However here’s my reasons for now preferring iOS:>The layout. I love the clean straightforward look of iOS. Sure android is more versatile in this field, but I always found I could never settle on the same look for very long. I just don’t notice this anymore.>No repeated or needless apps, I got so used to being forced to have multiple keyboards media players message apps and gallery’s it became senseless having stock android and then the manufacturer apps together. No need for launchers or anything 3rd party anymore. I think the system apps are just that good.>Freedom to uninstall. On my device almost every app bar the core apps can be uninstalled at the tap of a finger. Another major of annoyance of android, it’s great having multifunction devices but not when your bogged down with so many you don’t even use.>Amazing battery life from iOS now. It’s a fact that iOS used to suffer from poor battery but I just cannot wear this phone out. Even games don’t drain the battery by very much, I am very impressed.

9005	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	GadgetGeek	1	Be aware of  few Sellers-Iphones sold here with replaced cheap after market parts	2018-08-03	uk	The phone is great but be aware of few sellers. Many of the Iphones sold here with replaced screen,camera or some other parts. You wont normally notice until you compare with other genuine one. If you have bought one, I strongly recommend you to double check.
9006	iPhone 7	256GB	Jet Black	Ainslo	5	Successful upgrade!	2017-06-22	uk	Had come to the crossroads with my iphone 5, the battery was limping along and time to renew, I am very happy with the choice I made, I love the larger screen and with it on zoom it is so much easier to navigate (good for ageing eyes). I opted for 256GB to somewhat future proof, very happy, thank you.
9007	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Alana	1	Absolute joke! Completely out of pocket	2018-10-02	uk	I have had the phone for 4 weeks and already the speaker has broke. I have had to send the phone Back to you for repair. I have lost loads of work due to this and have also had to pay out £60 to repair an old phone so I am not without a phone. An absolute joke!

9010	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Farah	4	Good upgrade	2018-10-15	uk	Great phone so far! Mind you I’m easily impressed especially because my previous phone was an iPhone 5c so this was a big upgrade for me lol there’s so many new features that I like and having more than enough space feels so good! (My previous phone was 16GB)The only downside is the phones keep getting bigger and my hand is small, but I just got a ring holder case so it helps.
9011	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Big Fred	5	Good supplier for iPhones	2018-07-16	uk	The iPhone 7 is a very good phone as verified by outfits like Which. This supplier delivered in a very short time at a competitive price and it arrived in good order
9012	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Greypilgrim	5	Worth your pay	2018-09-05	uk	I am very happy that I bought this phone even though I was quite hesitant before about the low price and chances of it being a refurbished one or one with few damages. But a brand new iPhone7 for this price was obviously a better bet than buying in any other retail outlets or the apple store itself!
9013	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	A guy with a PhD	5	This phone is amazing. It’s worth the price. And has no faults.	2019-02-28	uk	I have a PhD in computing and so far I opened this phone and found nothing wrong. The lcd(display) works fine and has no scratches, battery health came at an acceptable rate, it’s 12MP back câmera is absolutely stunning and the 7MP face camera is very cool. I would definetly recomendo you buy this!
9014	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Hesham	5	Works Great	2019-02-15	uk	I wanted to go for a light-weight small iPhone again after getting the XS. The 7 is the lightest, smallest and well-supported (wrt iOS updates) that I could find. It does the job.The phone was delivered in one day during the busy Christmas period. I was desperate for it as I was travelling at this time. Almost 2 months now, and it works perfectly, no problems at all. As with small iPhones (and smartphones) the battery doesn't last long if you're running heavy workloads like Fortnite, etc.
9015	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Diogo Martins	4	"Good phone, in better condition than I imagined"	2018-10-24	uk	Great phone, though it had a 2 business days delivery delay and the apple wall plug charger was missing, that's a negative point since it was in the description.

9018	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Katie	2	Badly damaged screen	2019-03-26	uk	Bought a used/renewed iPhone 7 in December. I knew the phone wasn't going to be perfect, especially for the price - but there is a small crack on the left hand side near the bottom. It's also severely scratched. My iPhone 6 I've had for 4 years is in far better condition, so the phone has clearly not been looked after. Battery capacity was at 87% when I got it, its now 85% but I haven't had any issues yet. I probably should have returned the phone when I got it, and somewhat regret it now.  But I suppose it does the job, and the touch screen and everything work with no issues.
9019	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Juliana	4	No IMEI on the Amazon receipt- you cant claim insurance!!	2019-03-10	uk	Product is great, I had it for 10 months, after 6 months the battery efficiency started decaying but nothing major.The point that needs attention is the lack of IMEI number within the receipt at your Amazon order. My phone was stolen and I couldn't prove my purchase.

9127	iPhone 7	256GB	Silver	K. Taylor	5	Niece is delighted with this 👍😁	2018-01-18	uk	Bought this for my niece and she's delighted with it. It more than meets her expectations and the 256 GB WILL be needed for all the creative things she's able to use the phone for that she never realised she could do with it. She's at college doing an Animation Course so is able to do some of her work on the phone. Her iPad packed in and this phone ""almost"" replaces that for many things, so it's not just being used as a phone and it's NOT for random Selfies!!!Unlikely that most folk would need 256 GB, but smaller memories available cheaper. I could not find the 256 GB version elsewhere, but this seemed a very good price compared to elsewhere for iPhone 7s with less memory.Whether this is the right phone for you, depends on your needs, so do your homework first to get the right model or it could be an expensive mistake.I'm glad I chose this iPhone 7 with the huge 256 GB memory for her and was happy with the price. It arrived promptly, no problems and I was happy with the seller. If this is for you, I would recommend 👍

9132	iPhone 7	256GB	Silver	Tim Oruye	5	Three thumbs up	2017-10-07	uk	After searching for a sim free iPhone 7 for a few weeks, I can across this deal on Amazon. The quoted price was fantastic and even paying a bit more for express delivery, I was still making a significant saving for the phone spec I wanted. Ordered on a Wednesday evening, received acknowledgment of the order nearly immediately. Then received a despatch notice on Thursday to say the phone would be with me on Friday morning with the specific time frame window given. Delivery came as specified and if I could give three thumbs up, I would. Keep up the good work.

I do recommend this seller!

The quality, packaging and delivery from the seller was excellent. No problems with the device so far and a real happy wife at home. Thanks

I have contacted the seller and just got response that this is what it is due to their business processes. Which is fair but misleading the customers is not and I pointed to them that they need to change the description of the product so that customer is aware there is no charger included when buying.

9162	iPhone 7	128GB	Jet Black	Oscar	3	I Still Miss The Headphone Jack	2018-03-17	uk	This phone is meh. I know that’s not really a word but it’s what comes to mind when I think of the iPhone 7. It’s meh. It’s okay. It’s not the worst phone but it’s certainly not the best.  The build of the phone is good. It feels good in the hand and it’s comfy to hold. The phone is a nice decent size although the display wouldn’t hurt to be a bit bigger to shrink the obnoxious beazels. There is one major flaw with this phone though and that is the fact it misses the headphone jack. For some people that might not matter. But for me it matters intensely as a lot of my time spent on my phone is spent listening to music and yes you can listen to music on this phone with Apples supplied headphones but the moment you wanna charge your phone and listen to music you can’t or if you’re watching something on your phone you can charge at the same time. And to me that’s a big deal breaker. Aside from that the build of this phone is magnificent.  The softwear on this phone confuses me. It’s simple to use but it confuses me in the sense that it develops bugs and then fixes them by itself. The phone is almost self healing in that sense but the problem is it’s causing the problems in the first place. And every time apple release a new update there seems to be a massive bug realesed along side.  The camera on this phone is amazing though. It’s simple to use and takes amazing photos. The problem is it’s kind of too simple to use; it lacks a pro mode unlike other phones like Samsung’s. The speakers on this phone are not half bad. But theyre not HTC speakers. But they get the job done and do it reasonably well. Overall this phone is good. But it’s not amazing. If you can afford to I’d recommend splashing out and getting the iPhone 8 as it seems a lot better than this one. Or not I would definitely recommend a Samsung or the iPhone 6 as they both still have a headphone jack.

9167	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	jamiepryor	4	"the camera on this thing is brilliant, better than other Samsung models that I have ..."	2018-01-23	uk	I’ve had my iphone 7 since early September and here is my review:Positives:- First of all, what sets it apart from other iphones previous to this model is that it is waterproof, meaning that you will no longer be placing your hone in rice when it gets wet, it also means that you get stunning underwater photos- Speaking of stunning photos, the camera on this thing is brilliant, better than other Samsung models that I have used that came out at the same time. This is also great as I no longer have to carry my camera around when I go out on walks and such.- The phones processor is very good and it runs apps smoothly and quickly without much fault, and many of the faults that do occur, are updated in apples software updates- I have the 128gb version of this phone which is a lot more data than I need, meaning that I wont ever run out.Negatives:- One major negative I think that most people have with this phone is that they removed the headphone jack, which means that all headphone plug ins go through the charging port, this means that you can no longer listen to music and charge your phone unless you have a dongle.- Another issue I have with this phone is that it is easily cracked, I recommend that if you buy this product, you also buy a case with it, so you wont end up having to get a new one.

I fear , that unless you use a case , the scratches on the back will be more obvious than on other models..time will tell...As for the phone itself..well ,a 256GB can't disappoint i guess...The rest..more or less similar with 6S

It's the best phone on the market, I used to have Samsung s7 but no android is as intuitive as this iPhone. Camera is surprisingly clear and crisp. Interface is fast like Sheldon Cooper after coffee :) amazing attention to the detail made this bad boy not only beautiful but silky smooth to the touch to. What a phone?!? Is it expensive? Yes it is but as we all know if we won't pay the price we are left with sloppy seconds. It's worth the money!!!

9184	iPhone 7	128GB	Black	tactless (no tact)	4	"Amazing, mind-blowing"	2017-07-20	uk	So, I had the red version of this, but I found the white bezels very distracting so I returned it for a refund.Now I've for the black one, I'm amazed every time I use it. The colours are AMAZING. It just like, woah!BUT.. but but … here's the big but.It's slippery and fragile.I use a case (AmazonBasics case), which makes it easier to hold. The downside is that it looks like every other touchscreen smartphone with the case on — but this is also a benefit. I do NOT want to advertise the fact that I'm carrying a high end phone so that some miscreant can throw acid on my face and mug me. [theives can sell it for parts even if it's iCloud locked]. So, I'm happy. [I'm not a show off — I don't care if people think I'm cheap.]All that said, I'm still angry at Apple :- they removed the headphone jack too early. (I'm not rich so no AirPods for me)- they're utterly obssessed with thin-ness. (While it is very, very impressive I shouldn't be scared to break a £680 phone).I use this phone — the iPhone 7 — for videography. The optical image stabilisation is fantastic.My main phone will continue to be my iPhone SE.Just a note: as impressive at the iPhone 7 hardware is, it's really the rock solid software (iOS) and app ecosystem that makes the iPhone so compelling to me. I see competitors — like the Samsung S8 or whatever (”unbox your phone"") — and admit they are jaw-dropping science fiction. But, even so, they don't have the security and stability of iOS.If you can borrow the money, I recommend you buy this from the Apple Store and get a refund on the last day possible. [dont feel bad for Apple — they are loaded]. It will help you appreciate what outstanding engineering this is.It's kind of a misnomer to call this a phone, of course — it is a handheld computer.Be warned : this phone is like crack cocaine. Once you've used this, and you get rid of it, you'll miss it ! It's flawed in many ways, but it's also the very best.

It is really nice phone and works perfectly, maybe my expectations were to high!

However after opening I noticed a sheet in the package stating that the phone will work with any network but once a SIM card is inserted the phone is then forever locked to that network, going on to say that if you are not happy with that then send back for full refund. That information should be in the description before purchase not a surprise on opening. And in any case I had already opened the phone. That is not what is generally understood by 'SIM free' and the answers to the questions that have been asked do not mention this locking so definitely deliberately holding back information. Nul points from me.

9207	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Keston fitzpatrick	4	Rough summary of the iPhone 7	2017-06-05	uk	The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are deeply unusual devices. They are full of aggressive breaks from convention while wrapped in cases that look almost exactly like their two direct predecessors. Even that continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a decade of Apple’s steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same design for a third straight year plays against expectations.Inside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to two hours.
9208	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	AMX	1	IOS	2018-02-09	uk	I am beginning to find that the IOS controls and configurations are getting increasingly and unnecessarily convoluted and complicated, and therefore counter intuitive and counter productive. The phone is also very expensive. All in all, rather dissapointed and will be switching to Android soon.

Sound is much better with the dual speakers at the bottom and the camera seems much better than the 6 although I am no expert photos appear to have more clarity and battery life is really good.

9214	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	sharron urnevitch	5	Amazing phone definitely worth buying	2016-11-09	uk	Instead of the iPhone 6S, with just a 3D Touch screen in the way of new features and a few power boosts here and there, we'd have had a waterproof handset with dual speakers, a brighter and more colorful screen and a boosted 12MP camera that took better pictures than the one on the iPhone 6.Changing the home button from a clickable entity to something that responds to pressure – and possibly even the loss of the headphone jack – would have been seen as innovative and alternative in a sea of identikit handsets.And if Apple had thrown in the new Jet Black finish with a top-end 256GB storage model… well, that would have been a real challenger, a chance for the brand to cast off the 'tick-tock' mentality of keeping the smaller upgrades confined to the S variants, and remind us that it just makes great phones.

9217	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Perfect Reviews	5	The best feature me personally is the waterproofing	2016-10-16	uk	I am really impressed with the iPhone 7. The new phone is really zippy and fast at what it does. The best feature me personally is the waterproofing. I think this is a great move by Apple, its a real shame there is no wireless as most phones today have this feature.Now i owned a iPhone 4, 5s, and 6, so this was an obvious upgrade. I know many people say its a 6s but yes your right it looks like a 6s, and that's where it ends. Hardware is upgraded and camera and IOS10 is brilliant there is a few features that i like more on IOS9. But hey ho. It works wonderfully.As for the whole no headphone jack i am really not bothered and has made no difference to me. You get a little connector so you use that. I tend to use bluetooth with my speaker. So again has not been an issue.I have noticed a difference in battery life. not ground breaking. but its about tweaking the settings and you can get a good 2 days life of heavy use i do. The box it comes in is a nice and posh box.The headphones though the little connector are the same as the other ones. So the connector makes no difference. So overall if your a die hard Apple fan then its a must.I look forward to the Anniversary Edition next will look. But this is certainly a good phone. And well recommended. I cant really find much negatives. I suppose the battery life could of been better. As they made so much its going to have a bigger battery because there is no headphone.So lastly if your iPhone 5s or 6 owner its an obvious upgrade. But if you have 6s owner then maybe not really benefiting only the waterproofing.Comment |

9219	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Jonathan Shore	2	Not as good as the 6	2016-12-28	uk	I'm sufficiently sad to have had every iPhone model that's come out - and am no fan of Android phones at all. But...the iPhone 7 simply isn't worth it. I have an iPhone 6 for work so can do head-to-head comparisons. Now maybe it's because the uk iPhone 7 has the apparently rubbish intel chip, but the 6 outperforms the 7 significantly in two key respects - mobile signal reception and wifi reception. I park the two phones next to each other and while the 7 struggles to get signal, the 6 is happily connected.Whatever else a smartphone is meant to do, making phone calls and going online is where it all starts from and in this respect the 7 is a  wry expensive fail. The camera however is superb, can't begin to say how much better the pictures are - a real step forward in quality.But for the basics, the 7 doesn't live up to its price tag and I find myself having to use the 6 on frequent occasions (travel a lot for work) because the 7 is floundering. Can't deny that although I will probably be in the queue when the 8 comes out I feel really let down by the 7.Yes, it's waterproof too but given my absentminded habit of giving my phones regular rides in the washing machine, I'm not sure it's that waterproof. The 7 is a bit like visiting an Apple Store at the weekend - it looks fantastic but is ultimately totally frustrating because you can't get any service.
9220	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Scampo	5	If you're new to iPhone - this will be a revelation.	2016-10-07	uk	I got fed up with my Lumia 650 losing Wi-Fi, being generally sluggish and (okay, I know it sounds a bit weak...) the Facebook never working properly. I gave Microsoft many months to sort Windows 10 mobile out but they haven't, and I somehow suspect they can't, despite being the world's largest software company.So I bit the bullet. I bought an iPhone 7 (32gb) - not from Amazon, unusually for me, because so far their pricing isn't good. I'm sure it will be - so Carphone Warehouse got my money.The phone is a revelation to me. Everything works so well, I'd forgotten what ""works"" means regarding mobile phones. Apps open instantly, the internet never fails and pages load almost magically quickly. The phone and the whole experience feels a million dollars (as it should at the price!), and - despite what the other reviewer says - 32gb seems plenty to me for my general kind of usage. If you were downloading movies and songs, taking lots of videos then I expect the 128gb version would be a sensible buy. I doubt I'll ever regret saving myself another £100.00 on top of an already obscene amount for what - a phone! Okay - it's vastly more than a phone!! It's easy to move photos to your PC now and again if space becomes limited, and MP3s really don't take up that much space. I think the 32gb version would suit many users - if you have the money!It's a stunning piece of kit. Well done Apple. To criticise the screen resolution by comparing it to a Samsung might technically be fair, but practically, this screen looks amazing. The colours are brilliant and the sharpness is as much as the eye can make out so far as I can see. Also, my last android phone left me in despair with so many updates and fiddling around. I came to the conclusion that android was a phone system designed by computer geeks and not made for people who  want simplicity. The iPhone is made for easy usage and does all  that could be imagined in a mobile phone.

9222	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Amazon Customer	3	It's OK.	2016-10-31	uk	Its an OK phone but its very restricted and there was no reason to remove the headphone jack but for apple to get more money out of their customers. Returned the phone after 14 days and went with the Xperia XZ instead and have found it to be much less restricted, a much more natural looking camera and more premium phone overall. Also has a headphone jack with 5 pin noise cancelling and hi res audio, which is a bonus too!
9223	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Amazon Customer	1	iPhone = iDiot	2017-07-10	uk	My first (and last) iphone: a lot of money for the most overrated phone! Average hardware specs with very limiting (& spying) software. Buying this iPhone makes you really feel like an iDiot. If you are looking for quality without the (many) apple software limitations and extortionate price then do yourself a favor and buy an Android.

9229	iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	AmazonAddict	1	Think twice about so called Certified Refurbished	2018-08-16	uk	First phone lasted only a couple of months before starting to go faulty. First screen kept flashing, then the earpiece went faulty. Took almost a week to get replacement from the seller.Second handset came, some sort of sim tray fault. Absolute waste of time, went and got one from the high steet at full price instead.There was zero apple warranty with telephonesonline. Its their own in house repair so I would certainly think twice before purchasing especially if you value your time.

I purchased with Amazon as the supplier for slightly more security, worth spending the few extra pounds.Have used multiple SIM cards in it already with no issues.Jet Black is beautiful, but will scratch and smudges very easily, so you'll need a case. The camera is great and really produces some top end pics. Delighted with battery life, giving me full day of usage with around 20-30% left at night most days.Worth spending the extra bit for 128gb, some of the newer apps etc take up plenty space and you don't want to have the issue 1 year down the line of needing to clear memory.

9284	iPhone 7	128GB	Rose Gold	Billersk	1	Ancient Device	2019-02-21	uk	Not worthy of consideration when there are much better phones available at lower prices now. OnePlus 6T or Pocophone F1 ae decent alternatives that beat this old thing out of the park. If you want to pay 2019 prices for a 2015 device get this!

9291	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Anglian Traveller	5	The philosophy of continuous improvement	2017-07-20	uk	As a several years’ iPhone user, a washing machine-related mishap with my 5s led me to upgrade to the new 4G iPhone 7.The regular 7 is the ideal size to fit your pocket and very lightweight, but a larger version of the phone is available for avid gamers who like a bigger screen and which has more camera functions too, with a £100 price premium.The main takeaways:1. The iPhone design as ever is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use. The 7’s case-colours are subtle and classy-looking with black, grey and metallic pastels endowing the phone with a quality image2. The screen is a big leap forward from the 6, with clear bright graphics and allowing you to choose icon and text size (perfect for those of us whose vision isn’t quite as sharp as it used to be). The regular 7 seems to have finally got the balance right between a good usable screen size and convenient portability3. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, using the phone in landscape format has the effect of widening the keypad4. The ring tone & speaker volume is clearer & louder on the iPhone 7 than any of its rivals5. The new cordless airpods sense when they’re in your ears and pause when you remove them, so finally an end to earphones with trailing cables6. The iPhone 7 is splashproof and may be immersed in water for a time without damage; Apple though does not guarantee the phone will remain undamaged if it is accidentally left in a pocket and subsequently endures a complete wash/spin cycle7. There’s no doubt about it, the new dual camera system on the 7 is fantastic8. There are three options for memory capacity (naturally with rising price tags as you go up): 32G, 128G and 256G. I would suggest that unless you’re continuously streaming hi-def videos and downloading big games, 32G is going to be enough for most users with a storage capacity such that you’re unlikely to ever need more9. Everything you do on the phone including your contacts may be backed up on the i-cloud, so should your phone be lost and not recovered, a new one may be easily reconfigured with your preferred settings and contact databaseGripes: very few -1. The battery life isn’t great but is an improvement on the 5 and 6, and moreover you can now buy a phone case incorporating 24-hours of extra battery life, though it makes the phone more bulky2. The price of the 7 is high for a buyer on a modest income, but as usual you get what you pay for and this is a premium productIt’s easy to see why Apple maintains market leadership with such excellent products and back-up service through their funky high street/mall Apple stores full of knowledgeable, intelligent and helpful staff. Make sure you buy a screen protector and a silicone rubber-back case to protect the sides of the phone in case it gets accidentally dropped on the street – which it eventually will.Finally, some one-star reviews posted on amazon are from buyers griping about having been shipped locked or otherwise non-functional phones by online sellers. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints about the seller. One solution is to buy from an Apple store; they’ll set up the new iPhone for you, transfer all your contacts, settings and data from your old phone and be available to resolve any subsequent issues.

9301	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	John Duffy	5	Iphone7 review for beginners	2017-06-13	uk	This review is for the IPhone 7, in general, not this ""unlocked"" model. I bought my first IPhone today, the IPhone 7. I paid over 700 Euro for it, with a no-contract, no-bill Vodafone-locked handset. First impression: excellent quality, the main reason I bought the Iphone 7. I've owned an Apple IPod Nano for years, it still plays great-sounding music, it's build quality is second to none, the rechargeable battery still provides hours of listening. So, I knew already the Apple range of products are exceptionally well-built. Having owned various Android smartphones I was reluctant to buy an IPhone. An IPhone has usually cost that bit more. Plus, the ransom ware targeting Apple IPhones specifically seems a terrible risk. But, being unfamiliar with an IPhone and having used the IPhone 7 for the day I'm happy to say it's every bit as quality a product as I'd hoped, it's easy to set up, feels lightweight and I know precisely where my money spent went. I can't yet comment on the IPhone 7's features but I'm already confident like a Volvo, (I drove a 7-40 model), and Mercedes Benz, BMW car, I know the investment is worth it. I see myself using this handset, like the IPod Nano, for a long time to come. Solid piece of kit.

9305	iPhone 7	256GB	Black	Dale Edward	4	"Do you really need 256GB when 128 is way big enough at over £150,00 less."	2016-10-04	uk	This phone is not just a phone, but for many it is a status symbol, telling others not only can I afford this new device but that I am technically savvy and keeping up with the Apple bandwagon of new devices in a fast moving technical field.To be honest, there is very little change in the appearance to the new iPhone 7 compared to its predecessor, however, that’s not the point as it is exactly what the Apple enthusiast would expect in that it is a visual attractive, powerful, reliable and efficient device with some internal upgrades that will help apps to work faster and additional obvious enhancements that will satisfy the customers desire to purchase one.So what is new and why did I get one?Memory size:  The 128GB seems to be the best and most popular option with best value for money, as it is sufficient to carry all your apps, additional memory needs and other normal things that you need to access.  The 256GB is just a ridiculous luxury and waste of money as there are very few users that could fill that size of memory, so save yourself over £150,00 and get the 128GB its just right.Design:  The design has not changed much in that the body and screen sizes are virtually the same as the iPhone 6 and it still has round edges and a nice feel in the hand.  There is still a protruding camera lens on the rear that some users might find irritating as this takes away a flush finish on the rear of the device.External Sound:  This has been greatly improved by the introduction of dual speakers positioned at the top and bottom of the device.  This has improved the sound quality immensely, which now produces decent stereo sound, great for listening to music or watching a movie without an earpiece.Headphone Jack:  This has been removed and replaced with a lightning port, but why is the question; simple answer is that it has released space for internal upgrades by removing the old out of date 3.5mm input.  This could be a big game changer for people who have bought expensive earphones that come with the 3.5mm headphone jack capability only.  However, you get an adaptor with the iPhone 7 that allows the 3.5mm jack to insert into the lightning port and the iPhone 7 does come with a pair of lightning port compatible ear buds.  They are actually really good and this new system is good, as Apple has decided to take a bold step, embracing change for the better and the future in design and innovation of smart phones.Bluetooth:  This has been enhanced with the addition of Apples own Proprietary wireless standard, which is so simple to use, where items such as the Apple AirPods (wireless ear phones) connect automatically when the AirPods are placed next to the iPhone.  These are brilliant as they are based on new tech where they pause music automatically when you remove one from your ear and they automatically switch from iPhone to iPad, or Apple watch.  You can buy the ear AirPods separately for 1,59 pounds and they are brilliant.Water resistant:  I must admit I did have great fun taking pictures of my son diving into a pool on holiday once with a waterproof phone.  The expression on his face as he entered the water was captured from under the water, which added a new dimension to our holiday snaps.  Therefore it is a great feature if you are next to the pool or sea on holiday, or if you just want to watch films in the bath.  On a more serious note, I have had a phone that accidently got wet and was ruined and therefore even if it is only protection for such a valuable and essential item then it is worth having the waterproof capability.Battery life:  Apple claim that the battery life has been increased from its predecessor to an extra 2 hours in normal use.  However, this is something that each user and the type of use with the device will no doubt determine.Camera: The rear camera still protrudes from the body however; you now get a dual lens main camera combining a wide angle lens and telephoto lens with much better low light capability, richer snaps and a faster shutter speed.  The front camera has also been increased to 7MP.Minor changes:  The home button now vibrates under your finger rather than clicking all the way in and the finger print recognition requires more pressure than previous iPhones.  To be honest this is just a slightly different feel for both functions but nothing to jump up and down about.Screen resolution:  The screen resolution and appearance doesn’t appear to be any different even if there have been internal upgrades to 1080 resolution and to be honest Apple are still way behind Samsung with their OHD resolution.Overall there is not a great deal of change especially to the appearance of the new iPhone 7, but with the internal upgrades and minor enhancements that they have made it is enough to get any Apple enthusiast excited.

9310	iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Amazon Customer	1	This phone is the biggest load of garbage I've had	2017-03-23	uk	This phone is the biggest load of garbage I've had. All that's this phone does is freeze, turn off and won't come back on after. And when It eventually comes back on after it turning itself off, it takes ages to come back on. I genuinely wouldn't buy this, I'd wait for the iPhone 7s or iPhone 8 to come out. You might get a better quality phone then.

Apple took it to the next level and created not a phone but a computer ! Not every one will agree to buy apple products because of the software but i think it is simple modern and easy to use. the down sides are that it has no 3.5 mm jack  for audio however you get an adapter from 3.5 mm jack to lightning which i think is pretty nice from apples side . i love the black finish on the phone and the camera is 12mp on the front so it can shoot 4k videos no problemthank you for reading my review on the iphone 7 :)

9318	iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Raj Kumar Basu	3	Not Value For Money - Paid half of the price for just only Apple Logo :(	2019-07-11	uk	Nice product but really over priced due to brand name. You can do a lot better than any android phones with half of this phone's price.  I  would say the Phone is not value for money at all ... :(The build of the phone is good. It feels good in the hand and it’s comfy to hold.The software on this phone confuses me. It’s simple to use but it confuses me in the sense that it develops bugs and then fixes them by itself. The phone is almost self healing in that sense but the problem is it’s causing the problems in the first place. And every time apple release a new update there seems to be a massive bug released along side.The camera on this phone is amazing though. It’s simple to use and takes amazing photos. The problem is it’s kind of too simple to use; it lacks a pro mode unlike other phones like Samsung’s. The speakers on this phone are not half bad. But theyre not HTC speakers. But they get the job done and do it reasonably well. Overall this phone is good. But it’s not amazing.Buy a budget android phone will do all rather more than it can do.

9321	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Gold	alec le vannais	4	Works great	2018-10-03	uk	Phone works great, a little more damage that I wanted (ding on top outer), but fine as I use a case. The screen isn’t a genuine apple display, so my Apple Pay doesn’t work, annoying!
9322	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Black	Margarita	1	iPhone 7 Plus. It didn’t mention anything about reconditioned in the advert.	2019-05-23	uk	I thought I was buying a new iPhone 7 Plus for the money paid. I didn’t receive a plug and charging cable or headphones although there were gaps in the box for them. The box itself was stuck with sellotape. Very disappointed indeed.
9323	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Gold	Dr. Danger Mousette	5	Good value for money - Decent refurb too	2019-05-28	uk	I  bought this refurbished iPhone 7plus because the price was good. It arrived very quickly, and was exceptionally well packaged. When I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised by the refurbishment. It literally looked like a new phone.In terms of functionality, everything worked like a new iPhone, with one exception. The home button had some 'play' in it and was sometimes a bit flaky when it came to unlocking the phone using the fingerprint technology.The battery life has been very good - comparable with a new phone in fact. The only time it drains unnecessarily quickly is because of quirks with Apple software, for example, you find that location services are turned on for apps that don't actually need it.Other than that, I would highly recommend this phone.

9375	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Jet Black	brentalexis	5	DONE IT AGAIN	2017-05-14	uk	Firstly let me give credit to Amazon for their excellent service. I went into a well known store which is on my driving route, thinking that I could just walk away with a newly purchased iPhone 7, but to be told that they did not have one and it would take two days to have one delivered to my home at a time that was inconvenient to me! On the same evening I went on to Amazon made my order and had it delivered to a local collection point the next day by 1pm. Brilliant !What about the iPhone 7? Well I have had a iPhone 4, a couple of iPhone 5's and now a 7. Well for me it is progress and in particular I think that this is just the right screen size, especially as I am of a mature age and sometimes find the text size a bit challenging. Most things are in the right places and there are new features which I will consider setting up as i get more familiar. The finger print reader is a good idea, as I have had this on one of my laptops for many years. It is very easy to set up. The main negative for me is the price is perhaps a bit too high however Amazon was cheaper than the shop I first tried so do shop around. However I hope to use this for a few years and so will get good value that way. So if your ready for an upgrade or a new kid on the block, I recommend it
9376	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Gold	Michela Santagata	5	Love it	2017-09-14	uk	Absolutely love it!! If you guys are like me: afraid to spend this big amount of money online for a phone that you're not sure will turn out original well then you can be sure you will receive a brand new iPhone 7plus buying from here!! Love it love it
9377	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Amazon Customer	1	Iphone is locked to a network	2017-08-14	uk	The iphone came locked to a network carrier. Even if the purchase says sim free. I have to spend extra money to unlock it after I already paid in full for it
9378	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Cambridge Kisby	5	Skip What 2017 Has To Offer! Take A Blast From The Past!	2017-11-12	uk	So you’ve managed to set some money aside, right in time for the release of the best new smartphone from Apple. In recent years, iPhone users have been met with only one question when deciding their phone for the next year: Small or Big? But now, Apple has made us change this question entirely. Small, Big or Stupid Expensive? For the price of your 17 year old’s Peugeot 308, Apple is asking up to £1,400 for their latest innovation into the smartphone world. Is this too much? Yes of course it is. Not only am I here to say you should skip the iPhone X (or 10 depending on your preference), I am here to say skip this year's generation entirely. The iPhone 7 Plus, in my opinion, is the best iPhone you can buy right now; and it won’t blow the back out your wallet either.Dual 12MP Rear Facing Camera's, 1080p 5.5inch Display, Liquid Like Smoothness and Performance, Touch ID, Waterproofing....there is not a lot of area's in which this phone set's a foot wrong. In my experience, it has been a joy to use this phone and have done for 2 months now.Now,  at this point in my review, I’m guessing most of your thinking “Another Apple fanboy…”. But let me reassure you. This is my first proper go at an iPhone experience. I’m typing this very review on an Asus Chromebook I bought off Gumtree and don’t even own a watch, let alone a smart one. In the past I have been frustrated with the slowness of Android phones in general; watching iPhone users get halfway through the first level of Angry Birds before I am even though the loading screen (yes, I still play Angry Birds!). The main reason I turned to Tim Cook is that iPhone’s just work and the software is optimised to work with the hardware. They may not have the features a Samsung Galaxy S8 has or the camera of a Google Pixel 2, but I can bet money today, my iPhone 7 Plus will still be in my pocket for years to come.I know you haven't go all day so I'm going to finish up now by way of a checklist. Camera - Great. Battery Life - Great. Build Quality - Tank Like. Display - Good but no Samsung S8 good! Waterproofing - Neat. Performance - Smooth as Frank Sinatra.You're not going to be disappointed with this phone at all. It might lack a headphone jack (but at least they still give you an adapter!), and might not have the edge to edge display of the Samsung Galaxy S8 or iPhone X but this phone is not for the person who wants the latest technological advancements anymore. This is for the 9-5 businessman, who needs a small computer in their pocket. This is for the stay at home mum, who wants great photos of their kids before they go off to school or college. This is for the retired father, taking their first leap into modern day technology. Whoever you are, you won't be disappointed with an iPhone 7 Plus in your pocket.

9389	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	L. Jones	5	Apple's best phone yet.	2017-06-06	uk	The iPhone keeps getting better and better. I have had every iPhone since they were first released.  The iPhone 7 plus does not disappoint.If you've ever used an iPhone before you know exactly what to expect, great build quality and a fantastic user interface.If you are an Apple person you really can't go wrong.Yes, there are phones out with larger screens and smaller overall size but you have to put up with the android or windows interface.  I use a Samsung android phone for work and it sucks, yes, you can modify almost everything on it, but that's because you need to.If you are think about getting the iPhone 7 plus just do it, you won't regret it.

The phone does have lots of wear but with a case it’s not noticeable and you’d put a new case on a new phon anyway I’d hope! Very happy with the product.

9407	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Silver	Conner	3	"Great Phone for Hardcore Apple Fans, but for an improved phone there are other options"	2017-06-23	uk	I purchased this phone to test it and compare my experience with my daily driver, which is the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus.The camera is amazing and portrait mode is amazing and my favourite feature of this phone.However, personally I feel like the IPhone 7 Plus lacks compared to the S8 Plus. The battery isn't as good for heavy usage.The software is more restrictive compared to Android on the S8 Plus. This is fine for previous Apple users, but can be difficult for people coming from the Andrioid world.I like the phone, but I prefer my S8 Plus over the IPhone 7 Plus. However, I do use the camera on the iPhone for more Instagrams; especially for Marco and portrait shots.The main message from this review is - research all the specs and phones which will best suit your life. The S8 Plus is an expensive phone and perhaps the OnePlus 5 might be a better fit for you as it's a lower price for the same specs.Research before making a purchase.

9418	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Jet Black	James Mitchell	5	iPhone 7 Plus Review	2016-11-05	uk	Design:The new iPhone is not a massive change from the 6 and 6S. It features the same rounded edges and 4.7” and 5.5” screen sizes as before, and is the 3rd in a line of an iterative design started by the 6. The most notable differences are the new Black and Jet Black finishes and the larger camera bump which is now built into the enclosure. I personally love my Jet Black finish as it looks like a mirrored surface and the front and back meet seamlessly - almost like a slab of aluminium. It also feels great in the hand with a more grippy surface than its matte siblings. I have got micro-abrasions on mine but these are only really able to be seen in bright light and in normal light are not noticeable. I have however kept my phone in a case since I received it and have seen pictures on the internet with very bad scratches on the iPhone. If you take care of it, it’ll be fine.One major difference and the cause of a lot of controversy with the new iPhone has to be the headphone jack - it’s gone. I thought I’d miss this a lot more than I did. The included adapter really helps the transition and just stays plugged into my earphones from now on which doesn’t really affect me. I also own a few bluetooth headphones and these work perfectly with the new iPhone. My only gripe has been when I have wanted to use my phone for Discord or any other App that needs headphones and charge. Usually I don’t need to do this but I prefer to plug in when I am gaming to stop the phone from dropping in battery too fast. My workaround was to use bluetooth headphones for this but the other solution would be to get a splitter, something that isn’t too expensive.The main reason for removing the headphone jack in the iPhone was to increase waterproofing. The new iPhone finally gets my most desired feature. I no longer have to baby my phone in the rain or be wary when changing songs in the shower. From tests seen on the internet, the waterproofing is very good on this phone and usually better than the IP68 rating it has. Apple is usually very conservative with its rating systems and although I wouldn't suggest going swimming with the phone, it’ll easily handle the odd splash or drop in the toilet. Using the phone with wet fingers or with droplets on the screen has also improved and I am very impressed with this. Before, a nearly dry hand was needed to operate the phone due to accidental inputs with the water droplets on the screen. On the new iPhone however, the rejection of these inputs has been sublime. Apple also claims a higher colour gamut screen on the iPhone which I didn't really notice but I really noticed the 25% extra brightness which helps outdoors. I would love to see an OLED display on a phone but until VR comes to the iPhone, I really think that a 1080p panel boasts the best battery life/performance/DPI ratio on a 5.5” phone.The new stereo speakers on the phone are another welcome addition I have wanted for a while. Apple claims a 50% increase in volume and I fully believe them. At max volume there is (almost) no distortion and they sound really loud - so loud I can leave my bluetooth speaker when I go to the shower. For casual listening, they are a god send. The automatic change when rotated is also great and the phone seems to output the same volume in both orientations, something I tested to see if it was the case. One thing to note with the added waterproofing is that when the speakers get wet, their volume reduces drastically and distortion is heard. This is solved when the phone dries after about 5-10 minutes but is just something to bear in mind.Performance and Camera:The performance on the iPhone 7 is just as good as the 6S. Although Apple claims a 40% increase in performance since the 6S, the UI is so smooth that you can’t notice it. It will be great for future proofing however and I welcome the change. Apple has swayed from its usual dual core chip however; the A10 is now quad-core although it doesn't use all four cores at the same time. Two are low powered cores which use 1/5 of the power of the A9 with the same performance whilst the other two are the high performance cores with the 40% increase in compute. This really ingenuous solution along with the slightly larger battery has made sure that the iPhone lasts all but the most demanding days. I regularly ended the day with 20% left which is a lot better than the basically 0% my 6S Plus used to rock up on.Both the front and rear cameras have been upgraded on the new model too. With a larger aperture, both can now take better low light photos. The front camera now takes 7MP photos and its low light performance has gotten really good - almost too good as now all my pores can be seen! The real star of the show is the back camera however. Low light performance is really good, on par with the S7, the current leader in this respect. Optical Image Stabilisation is also standard on all iPhone 7 models now which really helps with reducing the shake on videos and reducing blur in photos, especially in low light. The real step up for the 7 is the extra camera on the back (making 3 total). This camera is dubbed the ‘telephoto’ lens and is a 2x zoom from the normal. This allows great zooming without loss of quality. Another thing it enables is ‘Portrait mode’, a DSLR like option which allows the background to be blurred out. This, although still in beta, seems to be really good and has produced some amazing shots, better than any compact camera I have used and rivalling (not replacing) DSLR quality at first look.Software Experience:The new iPhone 7s all ship with iOS 10, Apple’s latest iteration of its mobile software. It does away with some things, namely ‘Slide to Unlock’, a legacy Apple creation and has now been replaced with ‘Press Home to Unlock’. This new method of unlock is really great for phones with Touch ID (not so great for non-Touch ID but that’s a different story) and along with raise to wake, makes your phone just seem more alive and useful. The widgets when swiping left are really useful for quick glances. I will look up my next lecture or check what reminders I have with a quick swipe and that will be it, a lot more convenient than before.3D touch has been getting better and better and the new lock screen combined with 3D Touch has just become a really great experience. 3D Touching on a Notification will bring up quick actions and even sometimes an actual window with previews of messages. This is an ingenious feature which has really helped with quick replies and is just something that is fun to do. Before, 3D Touch was limited to previewing and shortcuts and now it is so much more. So many apps take advantage of it for extra content, quick settings and its convenience and tight integration is something you don’t find on any other smartphone. I have got used to shortcuts from my 6S and now use a few, not as many as Apple may hope but enough to justify it as a feature.One of my favourite features about the new iPhone 7 has to be the Taptic Engine. It has been improved since the 6S to now vibrate on some other things happening in the system. For example pulling down the notification shade causes a small bump when it hits the bottom, when scrolling through the different minutes in the clock app, it will give a small bump at each one it scrolls past. Although these may seem like small things, this really gives the iPhone a mechanical feel which is really nice. I actively seek out ways to use these things as they just feel so futuristic whilst retro at the same time, a throwback to the mechanical days.This Taptic Engine is also used to power the home button. No longer a physical switch, the home button is now a solid state button that activates when it senses a force on it. At first I was not so sure about the button. It feels different to anything I have used before and sometimes can feel like the whole bottom of the phone is moving. However, I quickly became used to it and now prefer it to anything else. It never fails and feels quite realistic and I welcome a change that will reduce the fragileness of a button whilst also improving its waterproofing capabilities.Durability: Over my month and a bit with the phone, I have (as mentioned) picked up a few micro abrasions on the phone. It goes everywhere with me; the gym, rock climbing, lectures, excursions and so on and looks almost new. I do use a screen protector however and over one of the parts where it is not covered, I have picked up a small scratch. I don’t baby my phone however. As it is all solid state I will chuck the phone on a desk and take it to places other people wouldn’t take it like rock climbing where chalk and the constant fear of people falling on your phone is rife. I really like the waterproofing of the phone as it means I can run it under a tap when done to wash off anything. I have had back protectors (like screen protectors but for the back of the phone) on however to reduce the risk of scratches however my first application didn’t go too well. When removing the film, I did notice that some of the markings were coming off the phone. These have just got fainter and are hard to see in normal light. I actually prefer this however as I never really liked the markings on the back of the phone however might be annoying when trying to read the serial number or any important information.Conclusion:The iPhone 7 is a great phone. After all the negativity of the removal of the headphone jack, it seems that many people actually can go without it, especially with the inclusion of an adapter in the box. The iPhone 7 has quite a few more features that do warrant its 7 name and its camera has been significantly upgraded in the low light department, taking really good pictures in the dark. Before with the 6S, I could see more in the dark than it, but the 7 seems to be able to pick up more than I can. I truly believe that this phone can sit with other flagship phones of 2016.
9419	iPhone 7 Plus	256GB	Silver	Chris Radford	5	Why I came back to Apple following the death of the Note 7....	2016-10-27	uk	My relationship with Android lasted for six weeks……. Here’s why I came back to Apple following the death of the Note 7.I was one of the lucky people who got their hands on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on pre-order launch day!! Yes for the first time in almost a decade, I had decided to move away from Apple iPhones and give Android a try.  How did that go for me though?  Well I can honestly say that I really loved many things about the Note 7 and by association, the Android platform.  Then the first recall happened.  I was slightly irritated!! Then the final ‘give it back NOW please’.I looked around at an alternative to the Note 7.  My criteria were……- 5.5” or larger screen- Fast processor and lots of RAM- Better than average battery life- Lots of storage space- Top quality camera- WaterproofThere were a couple of Samsung features that I really loved, but I knew I had to live without them if I wanted a premium device that wasn’t Samsung - wireless charging being the main one.So why the iPhone 7 Plus then?  Looking at my list of requirements, I couldn’t find a single alternative that could offer all of these features that WASN’T the iPhone.  I remember watching the Apple keynote about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with my Note 7 in my hand, almost hoping that it would be a disappointment.  Sadly the only gripe that I could find was the lack of the 3.5mm headphone socket.  I’ve found a solution to that problem which cost around £15 - Mpow Streambot Mini Bluetooth 4.0 A2DP Wireless Receiver Adapter for Audio Streaming System and Car Kits.  So I’ve had the iPhone 7 Plus for about two weeks now and here’s my early review.Form FactorI have to say that I love the feel of the iPhone 7 Plus.  The silver model looks beautiful naked.  It’s slightly slippery in the hand so if you’re not going to use a case, I recommend a good quality skin or you’re going to drop it.  Apple have redesigned the phone to make the antenna bands less visible, and they’ve got it spot on.  The sleep/wake button, slightly redesigned volume buttons and the mute switch are all in the same place, as is the home key, but this is one of the major redesigns for 2016 - the home key is no longer a physical button.  Apple have used their Taptic Engine to trick your finger into believing you’ve pressed a button, and it really does work.  Whether you want to wake up your phone, launch Siri or close an app, the brand new home key let’s you know that it’s received your command with a little buzz.  There’s even a choice of how much feedback you get from the button.  In my opinion, this great new feature also means that there’s one less piece of hardware to fail and it also forms a part of how the phone has become water resistant.DisplayLet’s be honest, Apple don’t seem to lead the field in mobile phone displays right now.  They don’t seem to have increased the pixel density of their displays since the iPhone 4’s launch of the Retina display.  That said, the iPhone 7 Plus offers a much improved ‘wide colour gamut’.  That means a far more real reproduction on your display than previous models.  Comparing this to the Galaxy Note 7 or S7 (the same display), it’s clear to see that Apple have made an improvement here, and you could argue that the human eye can’t distinguish between the quality of displays beyond 400ppi so it really becomes about manufacturer spec-boasting.  As I review my photos, I feel that they are more alive than ever.  Added to this, the 3D Touch feature, which I felt was a bit of a white elephant last year, really comes into its own now.  More and more 3rd party apps have embraced the concept and now you can use force touch to simplify tasks.  No other brand offers this technology right now and it wasn’t until I started using it again, after my six weeks in the Samsung wilderness, that I realised how much I’ve missed it.CameraWhat can I say about the iPhone 7 Plus camera?  One word - WOW.  iOS 10.1 brought with it the fantastic ‘Portrait Mode’ update, promised in the iPhone 7 launch keynote.  This is Apple’s best ever camera and it truly is the best camera I have ever owned.  Not only is it lightning fast to launch - take the phone out of your pocket and raise it to eye level, swipe to the left and bang it’s ready to shoot - but everything about it is improved.  The all-new wide colour gamut on the display gives you a much more reliable preview of your picture before you shoot, focusing is quick and reliable and the new telephoto lens allows for 2x optical zoom which really does make a difference.  It also means that the phone is capable of 10x digital zoom to a much higher quality.  The difference between this camera and the 6S is really noticeable.Portrait mode is a breakthrough.  Some Android phones have tried to mimic this feature, but Apple use a mixture of hardware and software ‘machine learning’ to give an effect that you would only normally find from a DSLR and a talented photographer.  I find it hard to take a photo without trying to use this mode now, and the results I’ve had in just a few days of the update are remarkable.  All in all, the latest iPhone snapper is a stand-out feature.WaterproofingHotly anticipated for the iPhone 7 / 7 Plus was some kind of waterproofing.  Many reviewers believed the 6S to be waterproof but I for one didn’t ever put that to the test.  Apple have achieved this for 2016 by making a few changes - the SIM tray now has a rubber seal, there is no earphone socket letting water in and the home key is software based rather than a hardware ‘button’.  All of those boring details give you a phone that can take a few splashes.  Apple say that you can submerge the phone is 1.5m of water for 30 minutes and have rated it IP67, making it officially water RESISTANT.  They have quite cleverly excluded water damage from the warranty though so please beware if you’re going for a dip.  I feel a lot more confident with my phone in my hand near water or around the washing up bowl, and I am delighted to be able to listen to music in the shower, though I still keep my 7 Plus well away from getting drowned.StorageThe Cupertino posse treated us to an increase in storage space this year.  Whilst there is still (and probably this will never change) no microSD slot, the base iPhone 7 now has 32GB of storage.  I’ve plumped for the 256GB, flagship model.  It means I’m unlikely to ever have a problem when taking lots of photos or video and I can store enough music to last for weeks of listening.  It’s good that Apple have listened to their customers’ need for more storage space, but I really wish they would think about adding removable storage….Battery LifeAnother year, another increase in battery life!!  This year Apple have treated us to quite a bump up in juice.  I’ve been getting a consistent 12 hours of unplugged use with my 7 Plus by virtue of the new 2900 mAr cell compared to 10 hours in last year’s 2750 mAr offering.  I’m somebody who has battery percentage paranoia and I feel totally confident to go about my daily business without an emergency charger in sight.  Compared to my doomed Note 7 with its 3500 mAhr, Apple seem to use their home-grown link between software and hardware to offer an unbelievably good battery life.  Added to that, the recently added ‘low power’ mode can add hours of extra life if you get caught without a charger for a long period of time.ProcessorThe latest A10 Fusion chip gives a multi-core Geekbench score of 5645 compared to the now defunked Note 7’s 5617.  In reality though, the iPhone 7 Plus massively outperforms Samsung’s 7 series phones by a country mile.  This could well be in part due to the deeper integration between software and hardware in Apple’s products, along with generally better quality apps in the Apple App Store.  Games seem to render faster and better and even with the Samsung developer tweaks, the iPhone still outperforms in transitions from home screen to app and vice versa.  The improved in-house designed A10 Fusion processor is further augmented by the additional 1GB RAM present in the iPhone 7 Plus.Earphone SocketI must confess that one of the worst kept secrets of the iPhone 7 was the removal of the 3.5mm earphone socket, and for me this was a problem.  A few weeks in and I have yet to use to bundled ‘lightning EarPods’ or the lightning to 3.5mm jack adapter.  Instead I’ve embraced bluetooth 4 and now use a fantastic device from Mpow which cost around £15 and allows me to plug in any old earphones into a ridiculously small box which receives a bluetooth signal from my iPhone.  The battery lasts around 10 hours with a 1.5 hour charge.  So who needs an earphone socket?  Well as a professional DJ and entertainer, my phone has always been an emergency fall-back device incase my MacBook suddenly fails, but for that to work for me I now need to carry around some kind of lightning adapter AND ensure that my phone has got enough battery as there is no way to charge the phone and play music through the lightning port at the same time.  I’m sure there will be an Apple approved solution to this problem some time soon, and once there is, one will definitely live in my laptop bag!!Virus and Malware Protection and Software UpdatesAs a long - term Apple user, both Mac and iOS, I have become used to the hassle - free nature of the marriage between software and hardware.  The area where this is by far the most apparent is in virus protection.  I can remember the darker days of Windows where the most innocent of email attachments could cause the world to come crashing down and my PC to completely stop working.  It seems that these issues are still very present within the non - iOS community, as I found when WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger both stopped working on my Android handset.  I couldn’t quite believe that this was happening on a 2016, flagship device, but it seems that I have been spoiled with Tim Cook’s gang and their commitment to keeping our devices and data safe.  If none of the features above have convinced you, take a moment to consider a world where you don’t have to worry about viruses.  Comforting though….Apple users are also blessed with regular-as-clockwork software updates.  You can set your watch on Apple’s schedule of releases of their iOS platform, and the statistics are astounding.  As of 27th October 2016, 60% of iPhone users are already running iOS 10, which was only released three weeks ago, compared to only 1% of Android users running version 7 which has been out for quite some time longer.  Even now, only 19% of Android users are running version 6, which was released in 2015!!!  Those are shocking statistics which are also very reassuring for Apple users as every update of iOS includes security patches that keep our devices safe from virus and malware attacks.So these are my thoughts on the iPhone 7 Plus 256GB.  As it turns out, it outperforms Samsung’s flagship 7 series devices is every feature with the exception of the earphone socket.  It seems like the demise of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 couldn’t have come at a better time for me as it saved me from myself and brought me back home to where my heart belongs……

9469	iPhone 7 Plus	256GB	Black	Lynn	5	IPhone 7 Plus is a define Plus	2017-04-10	uk	Absolutely fabulous. The service I received was spot on. The phone is brilliant. I had been looking at the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 plus and couldn't make my mind up which to have. I decided to have the 7 plus. I have not regretted it one bit. It's a great size and to be honest I hardly use my iPad now as the screen is so much better in size than I had expected

9471	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Silver	blackjazz	5	A stunning piece of technology	2017-05-02	uk	What's not to love about this device?(Apart from the price)I don't by Apple for the image. I buy for the ease of use and the reliability. I've not been disappointed by this iPhone.

9474	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	David Taylor	1	Review	2019-01-13	uk	It's advertised like it brand new it dose not say they are second hand but reading reviews it sounds like they are.
9475	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Jet Black	PTZ	4	Pricey but good allrounder	2017-05-07	uk	Screen -This 1080p screen is very good. I have been a long-time fan of vivid displays by Samsung, and this display is just about vibrant. The highest brightness level is very good.The fairly adequate resolution helps to give a clear screen.But to be honest, a 1080p screen is good enough at this size (5.5 inches diagonally).Build Quality-Very good. In par with The Samsung S8 and Google Pixel phone. Non removable back. No big improvement in design since the IPhone 6 plus though.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, specially for a phone. Not as powerful as the dual speakers of say the Axon 7.But then its in par with the Samsung S7 series. No headphone jack, hence they have provided an adaptor for that, to plug in your old earphones. The other alternative would be to use a wireless headphone.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag. Have not had any issues so far with sluggishness or re-starts etc. However, some android phones get marginally slower after about 6 months of use. You would note that IPhone has considerably lower RAM than the counterpart Android phones.But I have not seen this impacting, on performance.Added features-Micro SD slot is not available to expand memory. But inbuilt 128GB storage is more than adequate for photos etc, as well as some movies if you fancy.This phone is IP67 water resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP dual lens back camera. Very good photos in good daylight. Acceptable low light photos, but not as good as the Samsung Galaxy S7 series. The front camera is good, but could have been better.Good for a quick selfie but nothing fantastic.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good. However, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon.Battery-Very good 2900mAH battery. There is no quick charge function. But you may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one and half days of use on this, if you are a casual user. If you are a power user, still likely you may just about survive a day.Price-The recommended retail price for this is £819, which is quite steep. Bare in mind that the after sales support is quite robust for a year though. When buying through third parties look at the  following- are they locked/unlocked. Haas it got 1 year Apple warranty (if its a used product it may not have full year left)Final words on Jet Black- This is a really sleek colour. But a fingerprint magnet and very much prone to scratches. I would definitely recommend using a case. Even when you put on a case, I would recommend cleaning it every week with a wet piece of cloth, since the dust particles which get in, could scratch the device.
9476	iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Jet Black	Joel T	5	Switched me from android	2017-08-02	uk	After being a android customer for years, my brother, who works at apple, finally convinced me to switch to iOS when the iPhone 7 plus was announced.  I have had my phone for 8 months now and I can safely say it's by far the best mobile device I've ever owned.  Everything is integrated and easy to use, the camera takes great photos, the speakers are louder and higher quality than the phones of everyone else that I know, the screen is super high resolution and the battery lasts a day and a half before it needs charging (though I usually charge my phone overnight).  I didn't originally purchase my iPhone from Amazon, so I can't comment on the delivery time or things like that, but the phone itself is a must buy if, like me, your phone has become an essential part of daily life.  Attached are 3 photos taken using my camera on my phone.

9489	iPhone 6S	32GB	Silver	John B	5	Great first smart-phone	2017-02-26	uk	Easy to set up and use.  My first smart-phone, but I already have a mini-iPad so have found it mostly intuitive, more so than my daughter's Windows phone.Be aware that although sold SIM-free, i-Phones not bought direct from Apple or other selected resellers (e.g. John Lewis) will become locked to the network of the first SIM inserted.  I was not aware of this until I read the seller's warning included with the package, which also included the option to return the phone unopened if this was not acceptable.  It was not a problem for me, so I was able to accept the phone, but my wife recently tried to change to a different provider's SIM in her i-Phone and is having great difficulty getting her original SIM-only provider to unlock it.
9490	iPhone 6S	32GB	Silver	Deak Clark	1	Useless because it was a stolen item !!!!!	2017-08-30	uk	It worked without the SIM card!  It was impossible to make a phone call once theSIM was installed because my server said it was blocked due to it being stolen inNovember 2016.  I was useless.
9491	iPhone 6S	128GB	Space Grey	alan carruthers	2	"Phone looks good, no battery life"	2018-06-23	uk	My phone was delivered promptly and packaged as described. The package contained all the items I expected. Superficially the phone is in very good condition indeed. I cannot see any marks or flaws at all. Regrettably the battery life is shockingly poor. New to me on an i phone there is information on battery performance and this phone arrived with 78%, this was its optimum performance capability. In reality that means I am getting less than two hours usage between charges which is not good by any standard, given this is a refurbished phone it would have been useful for such vital information to be included in the advert. I am now forced to obtain a new battery which makes the initially attractive cost of this phone greater than I had hoped. An almost perfect product ruined through lack of information by the seller.
9492	iPhone 6S	32GB	Silver	OPENSKY RESOURCES	5	Highly recommended that you check	2018-10-16	uk	Highly recommended that you check the phone is not locked with find my iPhone

9495	iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Grey	M. E. Johnson	4	Great phone but service a bit tardy	2019-01-20	uk	Ordered the Unlocked phone over Christmas. Arrived a week or so later. I found the phone to be locked to EE, despite the unlocked description. I took it to a market stall to be unlocked, at a cost of £30. Once unlocked, (2 days) I am very pleased with the phone. Works well, and battery life good. Also very pleased that Amazon refunded the £30 spent un locking it. Now I am pleased with the deal, but it was a little frustrating getting there..

9503	iPhone 6S	32GB	Gold	Andy Turner	1	Replacement Apple product dead on arrival - Suspect a faulty batch	2019-06-01	uk	This Replacement for a dead on arrival Apple phone was also dead on arrival. After much chasing by myself with both Amazon and Apple neither Apple or Amazon could help with my suggestion that somebody check the stock of these phones as it would seem that there could be a faulty batch in circulation. I had to come up with my own solution, which was to order a different colour phone and return the replacement. The different colour phone works. Again not impressed with support from Amazon or Apple

Each phone gets worse.Usually after an update the device will slow down!It often claims i have 4G or im connected to wifi, yet still nothing on any app works (internet wise)I constantly miss notifications because of this. My last iphone did the same after a year.apply used to be ahead, now they just mug off customers.I have to admit, I still love the touch screen over any other devices on the market. but it's not worth it.

I was going to buy second hand but so many reviews said people were having problems with these that I thought I would go for a new one. The phone arrived later than originally advertised and then.. nothing.  Tried to switch it on - nothing.  Charged it, charges it some more, tried a reset, tried everything - it just didn’t work.  So ended up having to return it, and do without the replacement phone I urgently needed

A month or two after using, the phone would turn off randomly all the time. Battery is clearly very faulty. Nowadays battery life literally lasts 2-3 hours. Such a joke, now I am stuck with this iPhone that I bought for a lot of money.

9579	iPhone 6S	32GB	Rose Gold	PTZ	4	"Good phone, still good despite being released 18 months back.."	2017-05-07	uk	Screen -This 750 x 1334 screen is very good. I have been a long-time fan of vivid displays by Samsung, and this display is just about vibrant. The highest brightness level is very good.The fairly adequate resolution helps to give a clear screen.But to be honest, this screen is good enough at this size (4.7 inches diagonally).Build Quality-Very good. In par with The Samsung S8 and Google Pixel phone. Non removable back. No big improvement in design since the IPhone 6 though. The force touch is new for the 6s series, but not very useful (atleast yet) in my opinion.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, specially for a phone. Not as powerful as the dual speakers of say the Axon 7.But then its in par with the Samsung S7 series. No headphone jack, hence they have provided an adaptor for that, to plug in your old earphones. The other alternative would be to use a wireless headphone.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag. Have not had any issues so far with sluggishness or re-starts etc. However, some android phones get marginally slower after about 6 months of use. You would note that IPhone has considerably lower RAM than the counterpart Android phones.But I have not seen this impacting, on performance.Added features-Micro SD slot is not available to expand memory. But inbuilt 32GB storage is more than adequate for photos etc, but probably not any high quality movies etc.This phone is not water resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP single lens back camera. Note that this camera has no dual lens like the ""plus"" model.Very good photos in good daylight. Acceptable low light photos, but not as good as the Samsung Galaxy S7 series. The front camera is good, but could have been better.Good for a quick selfie but nothing fantastic.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good. However, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon.Battery-Very good 1715 mAH battery. There is no quick charge function. But you may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one day of use on this, if you are a casual user. If you are a power user, still you may struggle to survive a day.Price-The recommended retail price for this is £499, which is quite steep. Bare in mind that the after sales support is quite robust for a year though. When buying through third parties look at the following-Are they locked/unlocked.Has it got 1 year Apple warranty (if its a used product it may not have full year left)Do you get all original accessories with boxFinal words on colour- This is a favourite for sometime now. But may look a bit discoloured after sometime (on the front).This is not a problem with Apple, and generally is an issue with all white coloured phones.
9580	iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Grey	James	1	Beautiful phone with rubbish software	2017-06-23	uk	I got this phone as a free upgrade and it lasted 4 days before I sent it back. First thing I did was upgrade to iOS 10.3. I work on the road and my phone is everything. I installed hear maps which I always used on my s5. Voice navigation did not work. Installed Google maps, voice navigation worked for 30 minutes and only when I was on the exact route. Set a course for London from Ipswich it completely failed. Notifications had no sounds most of the time. I tried calling my provider and selecting the options on the ivr , selecting the numbers on the phone did nothing. Getting an s7 now. Like buying an Alfa, blinded by beauty but rubbish reliability under the bonnet. Never again.
9581	iPhone 6S	32GB	Silver	Amazon Customer	5	"Perfectly sized, one of Apple's best products"	2018-12-27	uk	I actually bought this to replace an old iPod Touch (unfortunately they seem to be obsolete) but am now using all the features of the phone. I love the screen size.
9582	iPhone 6S	32GB	Rose Gold	Morgoth	5	Nice phone	2019-07-14	uk	I got one of these due to my SE screen breaking after two years of abuse..... I always buy the cheapest NEW iPhone available, which happens to be the 6s at the moment, and the 6s is the same on the inside as the SE. The battery probably won’t last as long, but the screen is bigger and the volume much louder than the SE. For £299 for a new iPhone it’s a bargain!

The iPhone smoothly runs the latest version of iOS 12.2 brilliantly!

Fits easily in any of my pockets so no problems there either.

9605	iPhone 6S Plus	32GB	Silver	Mrs. H. Pask	5	"Brand new phone sealed in box, perfect."	2019-06-25	uk	The only thing I disliked about this item was the lead and plug to recharge the phone. It is very slow. But as I have my old one I use that so not a problem. Apart from that the phone is perfect, I have had no issues with it except that it needed the ios upgrading which means the phone has been sat on a shelf for a while. But that took me 10 minutes to sort out. The phone works perfectly well and the camera is far better than my old phone (iphone 5)  love the live photos. I was dubious buying it from Amazon but neednt have worried, it is fine and well worth the £349 I paid for it.

10523	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Mercuryball	1	Save your money.	2019-02-05	us	The most expensive POS to come out of Apple. It’s a $200 phone for $1000 bucks. If took the same money and put it towards a great camera you would have a professional camera and could buy a simple phone. Apple has duped us once again. By far the worst apple purchase I have made. My last time I buy a phone from this overindulgent company that puts more thought into its packaging than its products. Basically the overpriced less impressive model that Starbucks and Apple have milked us for for years. Learning that Apple no longer is innovative...it follows an ever growing pack of cheaper, more stylish competitors.

10533	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Gary B	1	Defective out of the box	2019-02-26	us	I purchased this xs to replace my 6 plus. Once I got it home, I noticed it would not hook up to cellular data. I also noticed that I had to swipe it two or three times or more to get it to open up. The facial recognition was very slow and sometimes wanted the pass code entered.  When I went to reset it, I couldn’t get it too shut down. It felt like the on off button was not connecting properly. Went back to the store, and the tech went through the same things I did with no success. They wanted me to go outside the store and try the cellular data. I did that with no success. It would make calls and text, but not send or receive photos or data.I decided right then and there, after using 2 hours of my time, I was going return this defective device. I need more reliable equipment for use in my business. I’m a pilot. After paying $1000 plus for it, I was disappointed. I will reactivate my 6 plus, which never let me down, and then consider all other options. They offered to replace the phone with a refurbished unit, or send it in for repair. But since it’s brand new, I can return it per the store policy. I Just don’t feel good about how this has worked out but definitely don’t want to keep this 10s.
10534	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Customer	5	Got me to end using Android phones forever	2019-04-07	us	This is my second iPhone. My first was one of the early models, and I eventually switched to Android phones for quite a while. When this came out, I loved the increased usable screen area. I immediately purchased one and have loved everything about it. I upgraded to the 256gb model and have way more than enough storage to keep everything I want on the phone. The battery life really amazed me. I use the phone for both business and personal use, so it stays pretty busy. I have never had to recharge the phone before the end of the business day. And the recharge time is very short - it recharges from 20% to fully charged amazingly quickly. The camera takes great pictures. When zooming in, the definition is still perfect. The Face ID is wonderful. I use it for almost everything and it is very accurate, logging me in almost every time. The only times it doesn't seem to work is in low lighting, which only makes sense. Overall this is a fantastic phone, I'm glad that I spent the money, and I will never go back to Android.
10535	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	CS	1	"Buyer Bewarer - Lost music, New headphone"	2019-05-05	us	We purchased this phone through a Verizon trade in.  By far, the worst upgrade in my 10-year history of Apple Phones.  Not only did I lose 65% of all the songs I painstakingly burned and created playlists for, but the headphones end connector has changed as well .  It is non-universal so you will not be able to use the new headphones on planes or other devices like tablets or computers. The music I lost wasn’t pre-cloud.  Nevertheless, Apple Support was very nonchalant about this loss.  They say they are “pushing” all users to subscribe to Apple Music!  Shame on you, Apple!  We’re switching to another product.

10541	iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	Matthew	2	I love Apple but hate this iPhone model	2018-11-04	us	I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6, which I had no issues with at all, other than it being antiquated. In fact, I loved the phone and all of the features. I'll make this review easy by simply listing the pros and cons.Pros:-Waterproof (allegedly)-Larger screen and better graphics-Better camera quality than ever beforeCons:-Insanely expensive-Facial recognition is not that great. It works about 70% of the time and doesn't work randomly, for unknown reasons-The processor is supposed to be faster but it is constantly lagging when using apps and I'm nowhere close to capacity-With the home button gone, you have to swipe up from the bottom to close apps. This is problematic when using certain apps because I often inadvertently swipe up (when playing a game, for instance) and close the app-The battery life is supposed to be better than previous models, however I don't notice a difference. The phone also takes a bit longer to fully charge

10544	iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	Abe Addler	1	No Manual Functions on Video Camera	2018-10-29	us	I got the iPhone XS and returned it 3 hrs. later. I'm a filmmaker by trade and thought this could be a breakthrough in filmmaking especially with a high-end 4k camera on board. I got the phone home anxiously opened it up and went to the camera functions right away since that's all I care about, a phone is just a phone otherwise. Well, I shot some 4k footage, looked nice but now I need to see how creative I can get. I looked for the manual shutter speed control, there isn't one. I looked for the manual white balance, there isn't one. I looked. I looked for the manual ISO setting, not there. I looked for the manual aperture setting, doesn't have it. So basically its camera is not intended for any kind of production, it's really a point and shoot. The HDR feature is nice but again, no manual settings. Not production friendly at all. 3 hours later I repacked it and returned it and got the LGV40. Now I'll do a review on that as well but the IPhone XS doesn't even come close to the LGV40 in any shape or form.
10545	iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	N. Sims	3	Lightning port earphone dock STILL huge design flaw...	2018-10-13	us	O.K. folks, I love the camera on my new Xs, it is way better than my 6 or my SE. The screen res. and size are great as well. However... Apple has put its heels down on the not reinstating a 3.5 port for ear buds/phones and that, for me, is a really big problem.  We are all reduced to using wireless phones or buds with all their inherent battery usage problems, OR, ear buds made expressly for lightning port connection - with their terrible flimsiness and proclivity to bend  or break.  This may be redundant or not important to many - but I hope that this review may give those pause who find this an important issue, and perhaps ever so slightly cajole Apple to reconsider either re-adding the 3.5 port, or making their lightning cable connection more robust. I have gone through 2 pairs of lightning port  ear buds, and 2 apple lightning to 3.5 adapters. Very frustrating.  Makes the Samsung Galaxy9 (with it's 3.5 headphone jack) really appealing.
10546	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Reynolds	3	Great phone but it WILL break.	2019-03-21	us	My first Apple product. Lots of neat features in handling like face recognition and password/login applicability.Very cumbersome with many artificial limitations doing email attachments through the mail application and even through the gmail app.Casing is HORRENDOUS. Looks cool for 4 days but is so slick and slippery that both cases on my phone and my wife’s phone shattered within 5 days. It will slide off your bed/counter/desk/out of your pocket/everything. Apple chose to make the case out of cheap glass. You will live in a state of anxiety given that the included cord is too short for practical use and is still heavy enough to pull the phone off its surface and to the floor several times a day regardless of the precautions you take.
10547	iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Customer	1	Cant wait to go back to android!	2019-05-31	us	I just got my first iPhone ever, and Ive had it for over a month...and its TERRIBLE!-phone volume controls all sound, including alarms, ringtones, media and any bluetooth device youre connected to. horrible setup. especially if you want the Alarm you have set to wake you up, but dont want phone calls or messages to bother you. and for the bluetooth this is really frustrating because you cant use the full volume range of the speaker without distortion of the sound, because you cant balance the input volume to the speaker with the playback volume.-touch response is terrible. about half the time I try scrolling up, the phone scrolls left to the previous page or screen. rather frustrating, and just plain annoying-battery life okay, but not great, especially if youre actually using the phone, it dies fast-camera takes amazing photos, AS LONG AS YOU ARE VIEWING THEM ON AN APPLE SCREEN, as soon as you display them on anything else, its just another photo from a phone camera- no expandable storage? oh thats right, so they can sell me cloud storage thats so clearly easy to hack...no thanks- lots of other pointless and not intuitive operation methods, like, to edit an alarm, you have to select edit, then the alarm, and to edit another, you gotta go back up and hit edit again....why design this way? zero user fluidity...ALSO, wanna click on the notification to open it? nah, you gotta slide to right to open and left for other operations, or slide it up for a faster go away response, which is the same as swipe left option, so again redundant, non-fluid operation that could easily be designed another way.My first iPhone will be my last. I gave it some time, but this entire setup and function design is really far from intuitive or fluid. I finally truly realize why everyone I know in program engineering or computer science has an Android.I know theyre popular, but like...The united states is literally known in part for its poor education and stupidity...no wonder this country loves this phone!!!
10548	iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	K. Pomp	2	Where’s the home button??	2019-03-31	us	This is the fourth iPhone I have had and by far the worst. This is the first time I have purchased a new iPhone and not been happy with the changes/improvements they made.  Them getting rid of the home button is a monumental mistake, that’s what really set iPhone apart before. Phone has good battery life and I like the camera features but would’ve been happy just to keep my iPhone 7.

10574	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Silver	JW	1	Data reception sucks on Intel iPhone models like the Xs	2019-06-02	us	Bought my XS from Apple direct and love mostly how it operates, but there’s one main thing that sucks, the data reception reliability, sometimes it’ll refuse to work even in places where I usually get good reception like 70/80 download speeds, I assume this is because Apple decided to go in fight with Qualcomm and have inferior Intel modems

10582	iPhone XS Max	64GB	Silver	Ohrwurm	1	Too heavy - too bulky - not modern	2019-01-26	us	I had an iPhone 6 Plus. Which was the big one. So I got the iPhone XS MAX on purpose. I wanted the big one (because I use it a lot for mobile film making & photography). I expected to be extremely happy with my new phone. The camera(s) are supposed to be very good. Now the report: The camera(s) are indeed great. BUT: The microphones on this model are abysmal. Very bad. It is a real issue, frequently discussed in on-line forums. Only I did not learn about it until after the purchase. Voices sounds muffled and unnatural, both receiving and accepting calls. But not all the time. The second severe downside is the weight of the iPhone XS MAX. It is 1.2 oz heavier than the old Plus 6. A BIG minus, though it seems small. It is also thicker. Very clunky and unhandy. It feels truly old-fashioned in one's hands. Not sleek. There is no joy in actually handling this baby. A very, very misguided and unattractive design for end-users.  I am returning the iPhone XS MAX. No wonder, Apple had to lower the price for the XS series in China. They have much more modern phones there. PS.: I am an Apple fan. I have all devices Apple. But this is a serious dud.
10583	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Amazon Customer	1	Save yourself the headache I’m v	2018-12-10	us	Do not buy! I’ve been an active frequent user of amazon prime.

10587	iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Victor Razon	4	Great overall phone for the price	2019-04-22	us	Hello, my name is Victor and I am a student. I have been using Apple products for five years. I saw this product on multiple commercials and after doing my own research on it I decided to buy it. Some of the best features of this product are its long battery life, user-friendly interface, and low price. The iPhone Xr has the longest battery life out of all the iPhones in its generation and it lasts me the whole day without any problems. Its user interface is also very easy to navigate which makes things very convenient. The best part about this phone is its price starting at $750, compared to other iPhones that cost $1000 and above. There are some negatives to this phone, however. The camera, screen resolution and it is not durable without a case. The camera on this phone is subpar compared to other iPhones in this generation which is to be expected at its given price point. The screen is also subpar to the other iPhones as it can only go up to 1080p resolution compared to 4k. The glass on the back of the phone leaves much to be desired as it can easily shatter without protection from a case. Overall, this phone does have its drawbacks, but it is still a great buy.

It’s well designed and built. Works wonderfully. The guy who gave it one star that’s not fair you had a faulty device can’t blame the whole product. Be real. Maybe five stars is much but I have no complaints about the phone. My complaints or with iOS so can’t blame the device. Sleek look. Smooth function. Light and big exactly what I like.

10600	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	H. Young	5	Upgraded from Iphone 6 to the XR and very happy!	2019-05-31	us	I don't quite understand all the negative reviews.  I'm loving everything about this phone.  Face recognition works every time and I can't find any feature that doesn't work flawlessly.  No more fingerprint ID, I just have to look at it and only takes a split second.  6.1 display vs the 4.7 I had with my old phone.  I'm getting used to the new navigation methods, but once I learned them I think they are great and much faster.  No more home button, but who needs it!  I have researched the new features and if you do too, you will learn to love it.
10601	iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Joan	5	Superior Performance and Value	2019-06-12	us	I have been with my Carrier for >than 20years now, so it was natural for me to go to them to buy my new phone, the XR, 64 GB. Except for buying the phone directly from Apple (Different considerations at Apple, though at first glance, price seems lower than buying phone elsewhere), I choose to forgo the Apple deal for many reasons including: I prefer to keep my new device for as many years as possible v only one year that Apple encourages; I have an established relationship with my regular carrier, including established credit.I do not understand this phone only working with one carrier. That must be connected to being an Amazon purchase. To my knowledge you may purchase any of the XR phones/any color from multiple carriers. It is just that I am a frequent Amazon customer and so I thought I would focus on reviewing the actual product, even though I purchased it elsewhere.I am also astounded by the mixed, overly negative reviews of the XR on this sit!e! If you read outside reviewers, including one in Forbes, you will see just how highly this phone is recommended, especially for the price. Search for multiple professional reviews elsewhere, do no take my word for it.I am physically disabled and no longer drive. So I purchased this phone online and subsequently via a phone call. I looked at the reviews at my carrier’s website before picking it. The fact that EVERY single review on their site was 5-stars helped me make my decision. That, plus the “RELATIVELY lower” price of $749 v $1095 for the X was also a huge factor influencing my decision. As for the 64 GB, that is what I use on my iPhone 6 and iPad Mini 4. It works for me. Importantly, I got a great deal on my phone, the advertised $100, plus another $100 that I negotiated myself. My net cost was $549, plus tax.  Shipping  of the xr & the return of the 6 was free (and prompt) both ways.From my decision making process, I want to review the actual phone! This will be short because the xr is as advertised. The battery life, which is the best of ALL iPhones-which I read online from independent reviewers-is consistent with my personal experience with the xr. Having had iPhones forever, I am blown away by how long the xr’s charge lasts—that is, only 1/3-1/2 of the battery is used over 24-36 hours.As for negative considerations, I have identified two minor ones: In settings, where you set how long you want to keep the phone on before it automatically turns off, your only choices are 1-5 minutes. I prefer the 15 minutes on the iPhone 6; I also prefer the Sounds of the iPhone 6-for example, when my alarm rings, it sounds a bit thin or “tinny,” lacking some resonance. I suspect I’ll adjust to resonance issue over time. I have only had the phone for a couple of weeks.There are my own thoughts and observations. Overall, I highly recommend the iPhone XR. Additionally, the xr is a fantastic  value  when compared to other iPhones.

10640	iPhone 7	32GB	Black	Sam	1	Phone wasn't unlocked to Simple Mobile.	2018-12-26	us	Ordered this with the intention of using it right away. I have other devices that run Simple Mobile and as soon as I put in this SIM card it wouldn't register. I had to call Simple Mobile and they verified my line was perfectly fine, I could not get the SIM card to function properly. Stay away from this listing. As you can see, the reviews aren't very good for a reason. I certainly learned my lesson. Will be returning for a refund. Very unhappy with this purchase.

10650	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Larry99	1	Phone is not GSM unlocked	2018-12-18	us	This phone is not GSM unlocked as it says in the product heading. Please read the fine print in ""Features and Details"" where it states phone is carrier locked on SIMPLE Mobile. It will NOT work with your existing Sim from T-Mobile or any other carrier. Aside from that the phone was in pristine condition; too bad I had to send it back.
10651	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	David	4	Read the description carefully	2019-01-03	us	I bought this iPhone before they changed the title and added [Locked to SimpleMobile]. The title exclusively said (unlocked) so I purchased this expecting an unlocked device.On arrival I unboxed the phone, the box was not open or damaged so it was a pretty decent experience. The trouble started when I put my T-Mobile SIM card in only to get the invalid SIM card message. I couldn’t get to the home screen or anything.I went back to Amazon to closely inspect the description, and sure enough at the very very bottom it said it was locked to SimpleMobile. No surprise here, but it was strongly misleading when the title stated it was UNLOCKED (hence why they finally changed the title now).But besides that it’s a brand new phone, no other complaints. Comes with all the original accessories. Only word of advice next time is to read the entire description carefully (at least skim it over)

It had the Simple Mobile Sim and instructions glued to the back of the box also.Just a heads up for others. Thanks.
10655	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Vikrant	1	"It is NOT UNLOCKED, @AMAZON is misleading people"	2018-12-17	us	All, @Amazon is cheating here. This product is not unlocked but locked. I talked to their customer service department and they had no clue about this and kept on saying that it unlocked. After spending 60 minutes, they accepted and mentioned that there is a small disclaimer somewhere about using the service of simple mobile. Ridiculous customer service and misleading information.

I got a better quality item then expected ( I bought the iPhone 7 Plus from wireless mall sales) I was expecting scratches all over the back but there’s only one scuff on the bumper of the phone that is easily covered up by a case. Everything works fine only issue is that it doesn’t come with headphones but that’s fine because I paid a great price! Would recommend buying from wireless mall sales I don’t know the quality of the other providers.

Do not buy this phone if you're looking for an unlocked phone.

10730	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Samuel	5	"Who needs headphones? The sound of music was never better from a ""speaker phone."""	2017-01-20	us	I know conventional wisdom says start with the carrier and strike your bargain from there.  But I knew it would have to be an iPhone, and my wife, moreover, insisted I accompany her to the Apple Store for my birthday gift--any Apple phone I chose.I went in with every intention to to get an iPhone 6S, since the lack of a headphone jack strikes me as impractical if not preposterous.  After auditioning 5-6 models, I left the store with the iPhone 7 Plus. The decision was simple--based primarily on one single criterion: the quality of the SOUND of MUSiC played back from the onboard speakers.The sales clerk suggested I not dismiss the 7 too quickly on the basis of the headphone jack omission.  First, the phone comes with an adapter that can be placed over your headphone pin and plugged into the charging port (that helps, especially given the collection of headphones I've acquired).  More importantly, the iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone with: 1. stereo (2) speakers; 2. pretty good (for a phone) speakers.The clerk then fired up a busy superhero movie score on the 4-5 iPhones I was considering.  Not helpful.  The clerk suggested pulling up any tune I wished through the store's Apple Music Subscription.  I went with Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue,"" which begins with Bill Evans rubato piano, then goes into tempo with Paul Chambers' acoustic bass (on ""So What"") in a call-response exchange between bass and ensemble.Using the iPhone 6s, with a single speaker, the bass was all but absent (the store was quite noisy).  Moving to the iPhone7 Plus, Chambers' bass walked right out of the phone speakers and into my ear, each pitch identifiable along with string ""buzz"" and extra-musical ""fingering"" noise.  Suddenly the question of the headphone jack was rendered meaningless.  The combination of stereo sound plus slightly more powerful, larger speakers was all I would need to get maximum value from the phone.I'm a hobbyist musician (piano), and I no longer practice with a notated score. All I require is a player (and a piano) to learn a tune, and a device like the iPhone 7 Plus makes learning new tunes easier than ever.I'm also a photographer of sorts, and the wider lens for unprecedented clarity shooting with available light as well as a feature permitting razor-sharp focus on a subject in the foreground and blurred-out focus on figures in the immediate background struck me as more than a novelty.  With my 35mm film cameras (Pentax Spotmatics), I'd have to switch to an expensive, long and heavy zoom lens to achieve the same effect.I've read that Apple may be planning on a blockbuster iPhone 8 with an OLED (curved) screen.  I think I can leave the curves to Marilyn Monroe or a Cinerama production..  The 7Plus should last me and, though it's a tad big and cumbersome as a phone, it should be harder to misplace and/or lose than the previous half a dozen ""candy-bar phones"" were.  (I don't need more than 1GB for using the phone, but 128GB is enough to carry a generous supply of music tracks and space for making videos).Only problems: finding the best carrier for the least money and unloading three barely used cell phones (2 Jitterbugs and a Spark Aquos Crystal--good screen but artificially ""enhanced"" sound and barely accessible controls, if you can find them).
10731	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Alexis B.	4	The Incredible 7	2017-02-23	us	I’ve been an iPhone user for years now and I’ve had the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and the iPhone 6s. Currently, I am a user of the iPhone 7 plus. Now that I own an iPhone 7 plus and have adjusted to using it, I can speak on both the advantages and disadvantages that come with the phone. For instance, Apple decided to add a double camera which I think is a good enhancement because it helps to improve the quality of the pictures that I take. I often take pictures of myself, my friends and events that I am a part of. A good quality picture can help to preserve good memories. For example, taking pictures at Thanksgiving and Christmas with all the family around the table and the children playing. Looking back at the pictures from these events makes you feel like you’re back in that very moment you took the picture. One of the features Apple decided to remove was having a jack for the headphones. Instead they replaced the headphone jack with another speaker. That is a upside to not having a plug for the headphones now, because now the phone is louder. However, I can not listen to music in my headphones and charge my phone at the same time which can sometimes be an inconvenience. In comparison to the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 has better and more advanced features. If you are a person who is constantly using their phone and likes to have all the newest techno devices, I would recommend this phone 100%. Overall I believe that the phone has made many well thought out decisions, regardless of the sacrifices that had to be made.

But now i have had some time with the phone using the beta 3 IOS and there is some good stuff. The camera just incredible it is beast .  The nice black color looks asewome .  The new home button it's different more kind of android phone.  And finally the speed wow i think it is faster that my macbook air 13 inch latest model .

10772	iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	MatT	3	Review from an iPhone 7 plus owner	2016-11-13	us	The phone its self is great, but it has some improvement that need to be made such as the dongle they give you to use 3.5mm jack headphones constantly makes buzzing sounds. The phone also has some weird little bugs in the software such as one time I couldn't adjust the brightness so I had to power the phone off and then on and then it was fixed, another time the phone was stuck in landscape view and I had to power cycle it to get back to portrait view.

All because apple decided not to include a headphone jack. And then finding a good case was hard. A lot of them have a camera opening larger than necessary.

No jack for headphones, the home button is awful, the sound is awful, I hate everything about it, just the camera is cool, but that doesn't justify the price. Is it the decline of Apple?

10791	iPhone 6s	32GB	Silver	Erika Gustafson	5	So incredibly happy with this purchase!	2019-05-20	us	I bought this phone for my boyfriend expecting it to be slightly used possibly a few scratches here and there and also I was expecting to maybe have so problems with it.(being ‘refurbished’ as description says) BUT surprisingly what I received was not that!  We got a brand new never taken out of the box iPhone 6 I was pleasantly surprised.  It works great, the battery lasts a lot longer than his iphone7 that just recently crashed, and it was in pristine condition!  What more could you ask for!?! Not to mention, the T-Mobile provider (or whatever sub-brand service of T-Mobile) has great super cheap options for plans!  I was excited when I called to set it up hearing they had a $25 plan with unlimited talk text and 3Gs of data!  I don’t know ANY service with that cheap of service!!  I’m so glad I trusted amazon and bought this phone because it’s exactly what we needed!!!

10794	iPhone 6s	32GB	Silver	Ashley	5	The left side of the sceeen wasn’t working but Apple replaced the screen which fixed the issue	2019-06-24	us	Came exactly as described, except the left side of the screen was messed up. When we tried clicking the “ABC/123”button on the keyboard, and the “1/Q” button it wouldn’t work. We had apps on the second page of the home screen and it wouldn’t let us drag the apps to the left to move them to the first page. I called Amazon to inform them of the issue and they transferred me to an Apple representative. After having me download the lastest update and resetting the phone, it still wasn’t working properly. Apple said I could either send the phone to them to be repaired or take it to a local Apple store to be fixed. They scheduled me an appointment that evening with Geek Squad at my local Best Buy, since the closest Apple store was a couple hours away. Geek Squad was very friendly, and replaced the screen on my phone within 2 hours, which fixed the problem of not being able to touch the left side of the screen. It’s a really nice phone and everything works perfectly now. It didn’t cost me anything to have the screen replaced, so even though it was an inconvenience to take it to get fixed, I’m happy they were able to fix it and that it only took a couple hours to get the phone back. I bought this phone for my daughter, because she likes using my iPhone 7, and she absolutely loves this phone. When she is playing Minecraft, the phone loads fast and doesn’t lag, which is what made us decide to purchase a new phone.

Great phone overall  really fast. the battery lasts like 6 hours at most which i wasn't hoping for. the storage is good but updates on the phone take up like 10 gb so basically you got like 22 gb free.

10808	iPhone 6s	32GB	Silver	Bob Jacobson	1	Buy this phone and you prov	2019-01-26	us	Bought this model via Verizon. A piece of junk. Headphone setting woouldn’t release.  Apple couldn’t solve the problem, Apple Store replaced the phone.  Just past rhe 90 day warrantee, same problem returned. Apple Store offered $300+ examination, especially as the dial pad was now generating error messages. There is no sure remedy, however. N fact, as a knowledgeable tech guy, I found Apple’s approach and evaluation superficial, definitely NOT confidence-building. The phone still doesn’t work. A multi-hundred dollar piece of junk. You’d be nuts to buy this phone and, I suspect, any iPhone. You pay more upfront and you pay more in the longer run.  Unless you get lucky with your Chinese gear. I use an Android phone and I am sorely tempted to get a Google Book instead of a Mac. What a ripoff.
