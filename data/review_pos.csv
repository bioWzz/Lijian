IPhone XS model A2097 for the European market. The same as in Apple store but 100 € cheaper.Prise European sector. Comes with wired earpiece.	1
Product complies with the announcement. Received in its box perfectly saddled.Personally, I preferred to go through Amazon to be certain of the quality and the conformity. I think that for a product with more than 1200 EUR, it is better to pay 50-100 EUR more and to be certain of the origin (bcp of reconditioned Chinese products ...) The size is perfect, but I put a little time to get used to the weight (I had a much lighter iPhone 6). But the speed and ease of use is much better, so we get done quickly! :) I had some transport problems with Amazon, which took two weeks to resolve, but I finally received everything. I recommend.	1
What I add more compared to the descriptionThe battery is excellent, it lasts more than 24 hours of exchange, 28 hours for me.A 24 hours I still have 25% juice in my battery. So much so that I had an external battery for my iPhone XS, I returned it because it was absolutely useless. Everything is perfect, the seller delivered me express which made me happy. 1 days for delivery. Do not hesitate to ask me questions.	1
At the top the latest iPhone Xs 256go with bluffing facial recognition. Ergonomic compared to my iphone 7plus. I have not yet tested the battery but already at the level of the grip is Apple! Simple and efficient. I received my iphone 24h after the Amazon hat command !!! Directly delivered in Colissimo so safe. I was a little scared at first but I confirm you as you can see the photos arrived in blister New and original.	1
Fast delivery, compliant product is an iPhone and Apple. In this case the white and much more beautiful than the black.I was a little afraid because of the negative comments. Fortunately a second time more Amazon did not disappoint me this is the second phone I buy.	1
it's been a week that I bought iphone xs really I'm satisfied up to nine because in his box but I do not like the way of delivery put my letter box without signature or anything despite there was rain gladly showered not touched the phone	1
Perfect. Slovak or Czech model box. No problem.	1
Ok it's expensive, ok it's apple ... but damn it works, it's fluid, the photos are beautiful, the screen ditto. The reduction applied by amazon and the payment in several times allowed me to acquire this gem of technology. To protect ... because the back glass seems fragile.	1
Perfect, nothing special to say, it's just the top of the iphone! All that remains is for our dear French operators to activate esim management!	1
With 300 € discount at the black friday, it's a great deal. Facial recognition is perfect except in dim light and full black. The bone is terribly ergonomic, the screen beautiful, the camera very powerful.I do not dare to test the tightness.	1
A little reluctant after some comments but no worries from my side.Phone arrive with a little delay, but it happens.No archos, or other.Iphone well referenced on Apple at the time of purchase allowing the subscription to Apple Care + for example.	1
RECEIVED IN 24 HOURSPARFAIT AND AGAINST SIGNATURE STILL PERFECTLY OF MAD AND MAGNIFICENTER TO REDIRED YET IN AMAZON	1
Order received in 3 days, the deadlines are respected and the iPhone XS was in accordance with my requirements (nine under seals). I recommend	1
Perfect ! Very fast delivery Chronopost, so signature at the reception which reassures.Produit, I'm a fan of my new iPhone!	1
Beautiful phone at the height of its price if I can say.Really a beautiful product, works perfectly, delivery by UPS really average (parcel soaked, left on the doorstep at the sight of all in an unclosed field ... , delivery note signed by the agent, short not top UPS). I do not regret my purchase, it is time to make it profitable now;)	1
Very good phone with a very nice normal finish given the price. A good battery life but Apple still has some progress to make on that side. The photos are superb.	1
iPhone XS conforms to the description, but at a very competitive price. Apple 2 years warranty displayed in the phone menu after activation of the latter. It is not a refurbished product. I highly recommend.	1
great seller, listening	1
Very fast delivery.Phone 256go at an incredible price  Invoice sent by mail quickly.RAS perfect 	1
The product ordered is the one received. Indeed, the phone was new and not activated (after verification IMEI on the Apple website). The phone works well at a price defying all competition (during the black friday).	1
It is simply perfect and sublime. As big Apple users, I can only recommend it unless you have an iPhone X because the change is not worth it. The gold color makes the device majestic.	1
Super happy with this iPhone, a fluidity without equal. Face recognition changes life and having this transition bar for apps downstairs is great.	1
Nothing to say, features at the top as usual, from serious to design. I regret the absence of the jack.	1
Very satisfied with my purchase, the phone arrived new blister in 2 days, the color is top and its operation too. No problem concerning this product, I highly recommend, plus it is cheaper than in store;)	1
Past 8s to XS no regret phone much faster nickel camera.Fast data transfer through the wi-fi.European phone received in a sealed Apple box with all its accessories.For those who hesitate do not listen to the reviews Negative because the product and the speed of delivery are irreproachable.	1
I really liked this phone, I use iphone for 4 years and it's the first time I buy the last model that came out, I'm really happy, the camera is beautiful, the facial recognition works very well and the battery is durable.	1
The product conforms to my expectations. The quality of the screen is striking and make me run the risk of becoming addict.The xs edt much faster than the X, face ID more intuitive also (without reaching the velocity of the ipad pro) In short, what to keep a lot of years with.	1
Product in line with expectations, delivered in time. Really nothing to say	1
I had the 8 plus before and I changed for the XS which has almost the same screen size but with a much better grip ... (The 8 plus is really big to hold it at one hand .. .) I am very happy with my visit to the iphone XS	1
Product compliant and very new. I hesitated when I saw some opinion but nothing to say Amazon is very good.	1
Very good image, good quality. super seller no problem	1
Not bad	1
Nothing to complain iPhone XS origin call. In this original box blister, phone with French charger.	1
Photo quality not the measure of comments and price	1
New product but arrived in a box too large in which the box of the iphone was not wedged.	1
I collect all Apple products so I had to buy that one to complete my collection. It remains an Apple product so very good quality and very beautiful, do not talk about the price.	1
Moving from the Iphone 6s to the Xs, a hell of a change but really too happy. By cons the price is really too expensive, I was happy to take advantage of the promotion of black friday.	1
100/100 authentic apple beautiful but little difference with the X sublime color level delivery too long and no signature	1
Great product nothing to report.Delivery that passed from Monday to Tuesday after validation of the order. Invoice that delivers at 15h a bit late !!! Only downside delivery. Otherwise compliant product and arrives without damage	1
Super photo exceptional quality	1
Great product received in less than three days and a beautiful camera	1
Article according to the description.I recommend it to you all	1
Superb !!!! Recommended	1
Dear to buy but easy to use. Robustness is there too. I also appreciate the quality of the images. In short I am very satisfied with the product.	1
The best iPhone is perfect the only downside price but I do not regret my purchase	1

Gorgeous iphone	1
Thank you Amazone for the after sales service because there is 2 months I ordered the same iPhone XS is I received a dummy under androïd never seen I returned the product refunded yesterday I crack I recommend the same phone received today nickel certified product Apple very happy with my purchase despite the price too expensive for a phone but hey it's a real jewel of technology I recommend	1
Hello, first of all, I would like to advise you to order this type of product only sold by Amazon, this "guarantees" that the product is new is authentic.I prefer an Apple to android because the quality is much higher, because The fact that Apple designs the hardware is the software and it gives a homogeneous whole. It is perfectly fluid, pure, simple and all in a very great power. Certainly it's expensive but having had for years an android, I do not regret at all seen the quality both hardware and software. It lasts longer and sells better. As for those who have an iPhone X, I think the difference in technical quality is not worth the change of course seen its extraordinary price.	1
It costs a blind even on Amazon! But 256 GB, it is still appreciable, especially when we struggled for years with a Iphone 6 16GB ... This XS and facial recognition is the top ... if we can put the price! Say Apple, you could not make an effort to democratize your products?	1
He arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Amazon offers to pay for it four times at no cost. It's really convenient to pay for it as well. The quality of the screen is excellent! The facial recognition works pretty well and it's really beautiful!	1
At first a little anxious after placing the order because some comments was a little scary but telephone received well before 22h nickel chrome I am delighted with the iPhone XS 64giga	1
bought at a good price during the black friday to replace my iphone 6s, I am very satisfied. Very fast. beautiful screen. Autonomy superior to the old iphone.	1
I bought this iPhone because the iPhone inci started to be old.It is faster more design more auto battery face id	1
I was fortunate to receive the iphone XsConforme to description.It is beautiful, I recommend without hesitation.	1
Product according to the description, fast delivery. Be blister. Nothing to say	1
Super smartphone, very beautiful and fluid interface.	1
Tous is three well	1
No need to describe the product go to the Apple site but otherwise phone a little big for small hands	1
In replacement of my aging iphone 6 plus.Telephone smaller in the pocket for the same screen size! In addition to the migration of data is super-simplicime and found his iPhone as if nothing was.Bref satisfied ... Certainly it's still expensive.	1
Unlike my Galaxy Tab, facial recognition works well, even at night. I have nothing to say, it just works.	1
In the top	1
Perfect received quickly and no problem	1
Well it's a great iPhone that I have now in my hands! Thank you for the delivery!	1
Very good it happens my phone	1
I use this device for my personal purposes. It is very powerful, with a very good photo sensor and a beautiful aestheticism.	1
I received my iphone before yesterday I galez to transfer my given in with the old iphone I had to go to call or he galore also without promising me to save everything if the phone is new arrived by mail with signature very secure and fast delivery	1
Thank you for the speed and all that comes from it, the phone is just a marvel.This Oled screen is unheard of and the Face ID of a practical and reassisant.J'adore!	1
Nine, nothing to report everything ok, received in 48h!	1
iPhone XS Gold 512 GB well receivedMagnificent and all new, Zero Km. Damage it does not cook..Thanks AMAZON ..	1
This phone is excellent on all points. The screen is amazing and the power is disproportionate while offering an impressive battery. Smart HDR photos are often more successful than with professional cameras .. In short, this iPhone is a jewel of technology, at a price totally delirious certainly, but that will delight those who want the best technology available to date. for Amazon: delivery WITHOUT SIGNATURE and on the landing ... It is absolutely inadmissible for an article of this price. What would have happened if the package had been stolen ???	1
Iphone XS mAx received this day, new device of 256go at the price of 1299e thank you amazon ... it changes me a lot of my old iPhone 7. it is perfect. hold in my hand, be careful you need a big hand, because it is big big .... I thank the seller A-Mountain for the quality of his service. 10/10 !!!	1
Excellent product, very very satisfied with my purchase.	1
No surprise, the phone is at the top (iPhone Xs Max): performance, screen (OLED), design, finish, iOS. Everything is there. My wife, who is an afficionados of the apple brand, loved her gift. And with 256 GB, she can hold at least 2-3 years (until the next phone change ...) before to fill it.But as usual at Apple, it is paid at the high price and in recent years, I deplore a very high price inflation at Apple (an iPhone at the price of a MacBook ...): it compensates the loss of volume by an increase in prices ... NB: no opinion on tightness, because I have not tested :-)	1
Imported product but complies with the description, no problem for use in France, French charger in the box.Impossible to find cheaper in store! Ordered on Friday, received on Monday morning with fast delivery.	1
perfect deliver in 2 working days	1
A pure Iphone XS Max for a price lower than usual (1064 € at the time of purchase, it's 200 euros saved!) It works perfectly well, recognized correctly for the synchronization of the Apple Store, iCloud and all what goes with it! It synchronizes with all that is necessary, so it's not a scam but an authentic Iphone! Frankly, it's expensive but what is good! It's my first iOS and frankly, there is no picture, between Android and iOS, there is a world of difference in terms of technological advance! Your wallet will be bad but your comfort will be put forward! Good buy!	1
To date I have received my phone it just beautiful and perfectly meets my expectations, Fast functional retina screen is just splendid almost 100 euros less than at apple so do not hesitate or no problems to report order in premium received the next day thank you amazon	1
Superb phone.Bought in white color, frankly a rendering without any false note. The design is beautiful. Features side, it has one of the best screens on the market, a foolproof face recognition and a perfectly stable and simple OS. As long as we appreciate the sleek style of Apple devices we should not be disappointed.Little less for the lack of some features that I have been waiting for a long time on iOS: more icons in the dock, landscape mode on the screen. Home screen (existed on iPhone 6 Plus or 7 Plus but has since disappeared) and splitscreen (split screen).	1
I have always used Samsung brand phone for once I wanted to try Apple because I bought my wife an iPhone eight more so I said I take the last Apple that just released the XS Max I'm a little disappointed Because it's not worth the price and at the processor or ream I prefer Samsung because the iPhone is a bit long	1
I ordered this from a third-party seller, it was stolen from the center trie tnt Orleans, refund 1 month after. So I took a 512 xs Max at Amazon Germany (big promo) .It is super , all the people who use an Xr and even more an xs boasted them, and indeed I love, nice toy, expensive but great toolbox, I do not use my MacBook 2010 and the pc of the job I m 's used only for work I had a 6s 128 which was great but a bit small	1
Great phone! As usual with apple! Delivery in 1 day without spawning of real iPhone Max blister port with Europe plug cheaper than at apple or another distributor! Do not hesitate!	1
Happy to find Apple. It's a joy to leave android and find a bone finished and a high-end smartphone that is worth it. A treat !	1
Original iPhone XS Max serious seller	1
According to the description and with the black friday Amazon, at A-mountain the 256 go was cheaper than the 64 go at Apple or some operators and other sites. Delivery faster than expected, I recommend completely.	1

Perfect	1
Hello I wanted to share my opinion on this wonderful iPhone. First of all it differs enormously from other iPhone, it remains incredible. It is equipped with many more things than the others, that is to say the photo quality, the speed, its movements, etc. ... I strongly recommend it, it's not just a phone is our phone. Buy it, you'll send me news.	1
product that works perfectly and brand new with 0 special effects	1
Produced in top quality qualities. Very fast delivery at the top	1
Nothing to say article at the top!	1

iPhone sold by A-Mountain and shipped by Amazon.The product is an import destined for other European markets but it is 100% original Apple with genuine serial number, original sealed box and accessories. No problem with activation. Sold with a nice discount on the full price.	1
Being an application developer, it's partly about my work tools. But as an individual, and having had the iPhone X before, I must admit that the main new features are very well received, namely: * Larger screen * High Dynamic Range (even on Youtube videos, while the application does not do not even propose the 4K but hey it's another debate) * The camera! I've never had so much fun taking photos in the dim light, in HDR, edit them in a while, make videos of an impressive quality (even after viewing on a macbook retina screen, quality is crazy) * the eSim, with which I can afford to have a pro line and a person on a single phone.Il is expensive, Apple sells it dearly (thank you Black Friday Amazon for that matter), but for nothing at world I do not regret my purchase.	1
BlackFriday so I did not hesitate to save 200 € on this iPhone XS Max! What to say that I am still satisfied with their smartphone. The photo quality is still well improved compared to my X. Facial recognition much faster and pleasant everyday. Thank you to the seller for this price beating any competition in view of the age of the smartphone!	1
Xs max 64 Totally newAbsolutely no problemFull shippingBlister like the apple store or the operators ... but much cheaper ... To recommend with eyes closed.Product great and it is the culmination of the 6plus 6splus and 7plus versions previous ones that I had.Franchise! Finally the gel	1
Ordered and received 2 days later. The Iphone is an original, well packaged and not a copy. The activation of the phone was done with no worries with Apple. Serious salesman from A-montain.I ordered this iphone because I wanted to switch to IOS and the design of the phone I liked rather well! I will only recommend this phone to Apple fanatics. Because report / price there is much better on the android side. Pay 1200 € and do not have lightning jack jack ... it already shows the color when you go to Apple.	1
Christmas gift anticipated and personal, I took advantage of a good price and am quite delighted with this phone with all its novelties! I began to learn to use the camera absolutely great of this phone. An impressive quality.	1
Quick delivery ! Less than 15h! Perfect product, approved by Apple because I could subscribe an AppleCare! Congratulations and big thank you!	1
Being an apple addict I guess my opinion will be more biased but I just switched from iPhone 6s to Xs Max and it's clearly a revolution. Thank you Amazon for Black Friday. More than satisfied with the phone.	1
Top than tell others about Apple I'm a fan	1
Order in the morning, arrived in the evening! Super delivery person, nothing to say in terms of delivery! Smartphone at the top of the top! He's just gorgeous. New product! I recommend it!	1
Just perfect ! Easy to use and the right size for my hands	1
No need to say it's a great Apple product	1
I have difficulties to go from one page to another and sometimes it blocks, I have to go through Siri to activate it	1
A good phone overall, even if the price is a little too high, at least 200 euros.I have an iPhone that still works very well and that is enough for the moment.I confess to have trouble with the larger screens, although Apple is quite talented in the field and is better than the competing manufacturers in terms of clutter.Plus jack, but that we start to get used.If you have iPhone 6 or higher, this one could suit you. If you just want to discover the iOS system, it can be a good choice too. I recommend!	1
Was great	1
The title says it all, it's an amazing phone. When I showed it to pro-androids they were hesitating to take one ... (iPhone XS Max)	1
Apple will still be Apple	1
delivery in the mailbox (so no signature) for an iphone! surprising	1
Photos and video top!	1
excellent smartphone. Obviously it is not worth 1500 euros ... the price is disproportionate.But it is really what is best	1
Very good productA very good photo qualityI went from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone xs Max and no regrets but there was a big change but we get used quickly	1
Great product, since 2010 I am a fan of the apple. Beautiful image, speed on top, I had the iphone 6, the XS Max nothing to see, it is toooooop.	1
Good autonomy, big screen, beautiful image, great pictures and nothing to say.	1
At the top nothing to say great phone no bug the battery at the top good view for the price on but I do not regret my purchase	1
I give you my feeling on iphone XR, that I have since last Friday, I had an iphone 7, I had before the 6, the 5 the 4 and the 3G. I was a little scared reading the reviews on the LCD, but given the price difference between the XR and XSmax, I did not hesitate ... the LCD is excellent, the difference with OLED will be noticeable that by those who want to put 300 € more (and again, the OLED does not have that advantages as already indicated in the tests that compare ...). Apple did a very good job by offering the first LCD borderless and with tap up wake function previously impossible to implement on a LCD ..; great autonomy: in average use, we arrive at two days, where with an iPhone X we hold just over a day; it's great to find color on an IPhone! It changes gold and money super tiresome! And the choice among 6 colors is really an asset! Perfect size for those who find the X / XS is too fair and the XS Max really too much. We manage to do almost everything with one hand where it gets a lot more complicated with a plus / Max. very good performance of the camera (a shame for the optical zoom and portraits of Mustaches ...), better in low light than that of the X and previous because photosites larger than the previous iPhone! We can choose 128 GB, and it suits the greatest number where 64 GB today are just and 256GB too much for the average iPhoner ... A real success, no offense to those who have succumbed to an iPhone OLED and who have a hard time justifying the price GAP, especially for a smaller screen and a lighter battery! This iPhone XR is the iPhone of the reason without leaving aside the Apple design or the premium side (best LCD of the market , aluminum and glass ...) I am fully satisfied and in my opinion it is not necessary to spend more! the colored back adds a punchy side, I love it! So except coming from iphone X, I can only recommend the XR! you will have a real gap in terms of display quality, fluidity and autonomy	1

We manage to do almost everything with one hand where it gets a lot more complicated with a plus / Max. very good performance of the camera (a shame for the optical zoom and portraits of Mustaches ...), better in low light than that of the X and previous because photosites larger than the previous iPhone! We can choose 128 GB, and it suits the greatest number where 64 GB today are just and 256GB too much for the average iPhoner ... A real success, no offense to those who have succumbed to an iPhone OLED and who have a hard time justifying the price GAP, especially for a smaller screen and a lighter battery! This iPhone XR is the iPhone of the reason without leaving aside the Apple design or the premium side (best LCD of the market , aluminum and glass ...) I am fully satisfied and in my opinion it is not necessary to spend more! the colored back adds a punchy side, I love it! So except coming from iphone X, I can only recommend the XR! you will have a real gap in terms of display quality, fluidity and autonomy	1
Very good product very consistent and very complete original Apple	1
The delivery was super fast, ordered on Thursday, arrived on Saturday! This is a great smartphone, we hear a lot say that its LCD (Liquid Retina) is zero for a smartphone of 2018 (in front of the OLED (as on iPhones Xs and Xs Max, and other smartphones ..)) but this screen is super good quality. I had an iPhone 6s before, and there I find the screen of the iPhone Xr just huge! He is great. in any case, I love my new iPhone XR Blue 64go !! I highly recommend !	1
Ordered during the BF18 at a price defying any competition, this iPhone XR is the happiness of madame.In terms of size, it is almost as big as the XS max in the hand (or iPhone 6/7/8 Plus) but the screen is really halfway with the iPhone X / XS.iPhone X / XS: 5.8 "" iPhone XR: 6.1 "" iPhone XS Max: 6.5 "" You should know that the XR to edges more pronounced and is thicker, so it's really a big phone in the hand. If you do not like the iPhone 6/7/8 Plus or they do not fit in the pocket, the XR will not be the right compromise. However, if you have never had a large phone in your hand, the XR may be a first approach, but not the most efficient. In terms of performance, the XR screen takes the features of the old iPhone (LCD) in a bit better and has a big battery and the latest processor from Apple.- It means LARGE ENGINE LOW CONSUMPTION. Indeed this smartphone can hold 10 to 15h. You have to go on the games to shoot before 22h! Better than the XS and equal to the XS max.If the screen is the first compromise of the XR against the XS, the second is the camera.For simple it is very good! It offers the portrait mode (the bokeh effect that pleases Insta) and makes beautiful pictures! But of course it is behind the XS when there is a little more than 2m distance in the photo. It does not compare with the very high-end android either (Pixel 3, Mate 20 pro ...) In the end the real criteria for choosing the XR, it is especially the price, a little compromise against some Hundreds of euros. ABOUT THE SELLER I received the phone quickly, it worked well from reception, so I did not have to contact him, the phone has no problem.	1
Face recognition at the top, excellent camera. 4G reception better since the recent updates. As for the screen I put the videos on Youtube in 1080p and they are displayed in 828p on this iphone. The image is super sharp and stitched just like on the TV application. Very very good screen. Those who complain do not have the XR. The speakers deliver a very good stereo sound. Super fast to use. Really very pleasant to use.	1
I took the Black Friday to buy this iphone because there was a really interesting offer (a hundred euros less than the price at Apple)! I was a little afraid of getting a refurbished phone, or even from China (with the sound of the camera) and I have to admit that I am not disappointed and am even really happy with my purchase. The phone is new, still under plastic with all the accessories provides (charger and earphones). It works properly so far.	1
Very fast delivery and very well packaged, about the phone; Super iPhone XR, fluid; very nice picture camera at the top; super big screen ... the sound ... a treat ... I recommend ... !!	1
Very surprised because with a reduction of 120 € I did not believe at all but the product is consistent, to see in time but until proven otherwise everything is up to standard!	1
A beautiful smartphone, fast, beautiful, a fluid bone, face id and simply magical forget it so easy. The liquid retina works wonders I come from an iPhone 6s, it is clear that it is not oled but it's beautiful, Apple has certainly made the most beautiful LCD of this generation, ditto for the night camera like days is beautiful, ditto video with the 4K and of course the wide angle. For autonomy I confirm 8 hours in video, surfing, games, etc. Etc. The quality of the speakers and powerful and net (netflix). The removal of the home button does not bother on the contrary very quickly we know the gestures that the replace and that are quite natural. With a 6.1 screen you have to love big smartphones.	1
After 2 attempts of 4X purchases at a telephony operator and a third attempt at a large high-tech brand impossible to get the phone! Either request for infinite papers, or refused, or more stock (but the money is still debited every time !!) amazon very fast for everything !! Not even 1 week and delivered even before the scheduled date! 0 problem !!! Portable top !! We bought 2! Only damage tel not well packaged bubble paper etc with transport is fragile as well that costs us 1 arm ;-)	1
Coming from an iphone 6, the difference is spectacular. The LCD screen is very successful and has nothing to envy to LED screens if it is a very slight increase in thickness and weight it seems to me (but it remains very acceptable). The size of the screen is good compromise: less than a PLUS model and larger than the old standard models. The faceID works perfectly with an instantaneous response time.	1
Fan of Apple and their iPhones, I went from 7 to XR, finding the XS too expensive for the "more" he had. This iPhone is very good and its big plus: its battery that holds much better than all other iPhones I've had. I find even more beautiful mate around the iPhone than the aluminum X / XS. I took it in black to stay in the "class" side and I am delighted. The photos and videos are excellent qualities, better than those of the iPhone X (for having made real tests with that of my brother). The screen is also very good despite the LCD and not the OLED. The absence of the 3D Touch does not bother me, I did not use it with my 7. For me, the only fault of this iPhone compared to the other last: the absence of portrait mode on animals and objects but there is the portrait mode for humans! This is for me the best value for Apple after 4 months of use.	1
Since the partnership between Apple and Amazon, the latter resells Apple products with the certification of the "" apple "", a bit like buying your phone at the Apple Store but with Amazon prices (-10% at Blackfriday ). The phone itself is top level value for money, the iPhone is the best phones in terms of security / privacy far ahead of the Android. Too little difference between the latest LCD and OLED iPhone Xs to justify the 300 € more.	1
I went from an iPhone 6 to this one. In other words, the update is noticeable. Despite the high price, I am delighted with my purchase. The quality of the screen, the performances and the identification by FaceID are top. And most of all, I love its yellow firecracker color! The most impressive difference is the capacity of the battery. In general, I use my phone a lot during the day, especially when traveling pro (web, emails, gps, miscellaneous apps, etc.) from morning to evening. While I had to charge my iPhone 6 several times a day (~ 3 or 4 times), I usually finish the day with 30 to 40% remaining battery with iPhone XR. Very satisfied.	1
Finally a real battery for iPhone it's great product was delivered in one day certainly the best phone I've ever had thanks Apple	1
Reception of the first Iphone XR 128 go suspicious and reaction of AMAZON remarkable quality and seriousness, sending a new new apparatus, that I receive very quickly and return of the other after reception of the 1st. The Iphone XR 128 GO works perfectly and meets my expectations. It is a pleasure to have a shopkeeper who respects the customers and I wanted to write it. -The quality of the screen is excellent. The image on the screen is really beautiful and does not have to blush what can be seen on the iphone xr. Photo quality is very good. FaceID, technical solution or I had doubts, is finally very powerful and very practical. I also added a virtual button to have the technique of my old iphone 7 plus. In short for now everything is consistent and perfect. And thanks to AMAZON for the seriousness.	1
So, delivery in 24h, bravo. 4 years that I had the iphone6. Today having iPhone XR is a little day and night. Photo quality, retina screen, multiple new smartphone features and much simpler are waiting for you. I highly recommend this technology jewelery	1
What a smartphone !!! Beautiful, big screen, the fact that it is not oled does not interfere at all, the image quality is still great, power and speed, photos and videos beautiful. A bit heavy and thick but it's ok. Coming from a 6s is really bluffing.	1
I do not regret my purchase I needed a phone with a big screen. Attached to the ease of use of all Apple phones I'm not disappointed. We quickly get used to that there is no button HomeThe only small downside is the facial recognition or it must be in front to unlock you can only save 2 faces and in the car The application CarPlay: the phone locks when you use it With Siri to call you have to unlock it just have sunglasses to be recognized it's a little reluctant but not disappointed I recommend	1
Ordered April 14, received April 18 by a carrier at my home.Boite sealed the iphone is nine no traces or poques.Et really a bargain at this price la.I was very suspicious but not all perfectSo these prices I would not hesitate for a new purchase	1
Coming from an iPhone 8, I really regret my purchase. The screen (although it is LCD) is beautiful. Photo quality is top. New phone and Amazon 2-year warranty, what more could you ask! If there was one negative point to give, it would be its thickness. With a shell it's a little big. But it's a question of habit.	1
Not being satisfied with my iPhone XS because of the autonomy, I decided to skip some features and switch to an iPhone XR! It's a great compromise! Power and autonomy! Awesome	1
IPhone super good .Nothing to say more about this phone that just and perfect.And congratulations to Amazon for its serious service!	1
Since a week iPhone Xr that works well operational restoration after a few minutes! This iPhone Xr is a jewel of technology that fills me on all points (photo screen speed)	1
Very good product everything is ok and everything works perfectly well	1
Everything is perfect	1
Great . Size, color etc ... iPhone at the top.The person who received it as a gift is delighted	1
Top from top. Good compromise vis-à-vis an X or Xs, cheaper than at Apple or my operator. Delivery in 5 days very effective and without problems!	1
Very good phone, the Face ID really works very well! Portrait mode and perfect! The processors are very good, the performance is at the top! The battery for the moment (1 month) your 1 full day using it very often, which is very good. The phone and also very solid, I do not put the shell of the phone.Very good phone for what sense screen plug Oled	1
I liked everything, great article. I received it with amazon prime the next day in my mailbox. On the other hand, the delivery spoke of "signature to the delivery" and I did not sign anything. But the product has arrived well, complicated to configure at the beginning, ios blocks a lot on the delivery of the account apple ect .. assistance called apple and worries set. So I recommend, especially the promotion of 50 euro which is not less on a new iphone.	1
RASJe did not find better in price.Amazon knows how to be unbeatable in terms of price (my case in black friday), but it must be reactive because it lasts only a short time ...	1
Ordered Friday and received Saturday night nickel! This is a real iPhone with accessories neufs.Par curiosity I was at Apple to verify the authenticity of the phone and I confirm that it is indeed a Apple product.	1
Coming from the Android universe I had a slight apprehension to land in the world of Apple, but it's the past! The quality of the smartphone is at the rendezvous, very fluid and efficient, powerful, simple. Getting started very fast, in half a day you adopt it perfectly..Il is an original product.When delivery very fast, in less than 48h and packaging very correct. The seller being in Italy I did not get the invoice immediately but after a request to the Amazon SAV, in 3 days it was sent to me. Very effective!	1
Just perfect to arrive in advance the packaging of the product remains to be reviewed according to the delicacy of the factor for loading but at this price you have an original Apple	1
Very fast, long battery life, 64GB more than enough for photo / video enthusiasts. Quality and brightness of impeccable screen! Face ID (facial recognition to unlock and validate purchases / transactions) works perfectly even in low light, with or without glasses. The absence of the home button for unlocking and multitask navigation and somewhat disturbing the first days and then is very simple and pleasant to use. Screen good size, larger than the 7th an exceptional sound quality, rich sound in BASS leaves the top and leaves the bottom offering a good stereo during panoramic playback. Price a high hair (apple in general) but the quality is there. Superb black glossy!	1
You can buy very good reception and compliant product in every way	1
Not much surprise with Apple. The product is quality, easy configuration, superb photos, reliable, battery a little weaker than previous models .... but other smartphones are as powerful at a more affordable price. Brand loyalty remains for an interaction between hyper easy devices, and IOS habit.	1
Very satisfied with the purchase. Just a little flat for delivery, it should be against signature and I found it in my mailbox without having to sign, it's a bit light for a purchase of this price	1
Super phone, he hold the battery, The design is very niceOn sense that the phone is robust which gives us a little more confidenceNo problem encountered so far	1
For now, I'm happy with my new iPhone. Autonomy really great, facial recognition perfect ... And the color red is very beautiful.	1
Wow, what to say ... phone on top. Not frankly it tears and very easy to take in hand, may be a little too big for small hands this said the features are at the top, storage, image and video quality, its impeccable. I recommend	1
Phone very easy to use. We quickly get used to the lack of button (with a little help from Siri in case of trouble). Phone delivered in very good conditions of safety (except that the number of the deliveryman is foreign so a little reluctant to answer at the beginning). No worries I am very satisfied.I got the 128go at the price of 64 thanks to an offer so I can not be more pleased	1
I am addicted to this iPhone.It is beautiful, good grip, no worries with I recommend.I took it in yellow and frankly it is beautiful	1
Received the day after the order, nothing to say for my first IPhone, works at the top	1
I just went from a 4 year old Iphone 6 to an XR! What a changeI do not regret my purchase.As all Apple, the grip is super easy.Can be a little heavy but we get used to it.A bit expensive to buy but having taken advantage of a coupon Amazon , I was able to give it to me.Bravo to Amazon for delivery. Barely 48 hours	1
Very good iphone, for me who used an iphone 6 for many years now and well it changes! I hit the model 256go 850 euros, at apple 1027 euros it seems to meOn the downside: its weight, a little heavy I think	1
I received my order in time super happy that for once a site can meet the delivery time.Contouring the package super well pack and the phone well protect. No problem I love I really do not regret having changed my 6S for the XR, easy to use I think, very nice in blue as in the photo is still a personal opinion.And I planned to offer it to my companion for his birthday in red.	1
Awesome ! I stayed on my iPHone 7 for almost two years. Nothing to see ! Photo quality and sound at the top, it's a real pleasure	1
I left the iPhone 8 to switch to the iPhone XR ... no regrets! I wanted a larger screen but not too big: flawless! Photo quality is much better. We find all the pleasure of an iPhone. I highly recommend	1
This iPhone is dreaming a lot and it's worth it I'm really addict to this quality! what I find just a pity is the photo quality I expected much more wonderful knowing that I had an iPhone 7 before and that the quality was better limit.Ça still a great product and works perfectly.	1

Having had an iPhone 7 just before the XR I am amazed at the fluidity of everyday life and clearly the biggest change is the size of the screen This makes me think of the passage 4s to 6, where I really appreciated the visual comfort for the moment the shells are not really great and in insufficient numbers (took a big ben failing to find better), the Force glass protection is however bluffanteFranchement I recommend it's my 7th iPhone and certainly not the last	1

After 3 months of use here is my return: As a prerequisite, I recommend against Android addicts for against, to all others, if you have the budget is a phone that deserves your attention.First, I strongly encourage you go to the store to hold it in your hands and make your own ideaSome will find it too big and thick and prefer a more compact model others, like me, will find it to the ideal sizeOverall the phone does not highlight the latest innovations but I think it's an advantage because it uses well-established techno which makes it reliable. The most One of the best 2 mono sensor on the market (with the pixel 3) Better than an iPhone X or an iPhone 8 plus Still in the photo : you go out the iPhone you shoot you shoot and you have a beautiful picture (Apple has long understood this point that has been taken since by all competitors) Autonomy: 2 days without flinching in daily use it's true appreciable Induction chargingSignificant point that facilitates daily use and frees you from a cable previously essential (I suggest you take a bedside lamp including a recharging system without file) The ergonomics of the iPhone still frozen but still efficient thanks to its integrated system.Advantage: flawless ergonomics and better security of our data6.1 inches diagonal in a smaller size than an iPhone 8 plus (5.5 inches) The repairability better than the competition ensures a longer life (ifixit score 6/10 while the Samsung s10 is 3/10 the oneplus 6T 5/10 or p20 pro 4/10) Resale is also an advantage of iPhones because the device will sell well.Finally security, in case the phone is a "brick" while with any android you have to go through your operator to block the phone (which should be supported by a complaint ) In term of finishes it remains excellentThis is not a successor of the 5c, it is high-end.Finally in terms of power it has nothing to envy to others being equipped with chips of last generation. The counterscertains application developed late on iOS and / or in degraded mode (control app Family SFR for example) or some features are restrained (the nfc for example) Customization possible with android I miss itMore thicker it will not be suitable for everyone and The price can cool more than one but nothing crippling compared to the competition (and its price has greatly reduced) But to take full advantage of the price of the xr is only a startBeing that it you will have to add at least the price of a shell and a protective glass (or film) Then, to take full advantage it will be necessary to expand with an audio headset, streaming music and video services. Finally, a VPN for tranquilityThe 64GB version is sufficient for ordinary mortals or if like me used a NAS to empty the phone regularlyFor those who have all their "life" on the phone (which I recommend without a backup) and those who does not like "delete" take in one with more memoryIn fact, Netflix (if you're the type to download entire series) and streaming music very quickly fill the memory.But with good management 64Go is quite sufficient.	1
Hello, having tested the iphone Xr I am pleasantly surprised by this report / quality price. I tested this product for 2 weeks trying all its features (Photo, Face ID, Wireless Charging) after testing everything I am very happy with my purchase and I recommend it	1
Consistent item received on the scheduled day. Nine sealed and invoice received on request. So perfect!	1
Excellent new product and very good value for money. Delivery a little late in the day which makes us block our day if at the top of the top! I recommend !!	1
Superb promotion iPhone XR 256go at the price of 128go thank you Amazon I will return to the receipt of the package	1
Very good phone and fast delivery	1
Excellent phone, just great	1
Top	1
After going from the iPhone 7 plus to the iPhone X (temporarily to buy the iPhone XR). The iPhone XR really meets my expectations, the sound is beautiful, the image quality is very good, the camera very good (the iPhone XS) and the battery contrary to what I heard is similar to that of the iPhone X.I intend to keep it a good time with the duration of updates with the bionic chip A12.A highly recommend !!	1
When you received the item, you do not even need to open it. Look at the serial number on the back of the box. If the serial number begins with an M, the product is likely to be new. If the serial number begins with an F it is a product reconditioned by Apple, so a used product. Beware, the guarantee is not the same, it is of reduced duration.	1
I had a SE that I loved for its size in particular! Finally one adapts very easily to this big size (I wait however to see the summer without coat to put the iphone). It is really great, the Face ID is really nice, the number of gig changes my life, the blue is very beautiful short a great product when we love apple. It is very expensive but finally it is used so much ... (finally me).	1
Totally conquered. Even if it is heavier than my old iPhone 6S, my battery is 2 days without worries (VS less than 1 day with the former), the photos are beautiful including the portrait. I have a preference for unlocking with the finger but works very well with the face. Note that there is no port for "classic" earphones. You have to take an adapter or a wireless headset. Despite these small points, I love it.	1
IPhone change from 6S to XR, the LCD screen absolutely did not bother me contrary to the opinion that it must be an OLED screen (range XS). The borders even thing I absolutely do not no attention, only those who have experienced an iPhone X or XS will see the difference. The photos are of excellent quality, for me this iPhone is more than enough without going into the XS range (much more expensive)	1
Honestly I was very scared it was a scam but nothing to say !!! Fast Delivery, Apple Product and under manufacturer's warranty for 1 year, new product pack with all supplied accessories! At the top I recommend however check the profile of the seller.	1
Really a beautiful smartphone. I have always had iPhones. 3gs, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7, and 8 plus.I wanted to have the experience of the face ID and I did not want to put more than 1000 € in a smartphone apple.I had a doubt about the XR it is true, but there coming from an iphone 8 plus is more. Ideal size, super edge-to-edge screen despite the reviews on paper, but only on paper because in reality it's like the 8 more or better. In short ... I am delighted with my purchase at amazon prices.	1
Having always had only Samsung, I have long hesitated before buying Apple ..... and waouhhh! I do not regret, the iPhone XR is just great! A real gem	1
I have always had iPhone since the first release and the last was a 6 More ... But there really is near perfection ... thank you again Apple for all the happiness you bring us! Sign and you've understood a fan of Apple	1
I was very disappointed iphones including the model 5 5 6 6 6s 7 and 8celui me pleasantly surprised by its photo quality and the quality of the screen displayune finish between a samsung s8 + and this iphone do not hesitate take this iphone he will leave you speechless	1
I was reluctant with this Xr compared to the 5c of the time but ultimately it's a full iPhone, despite the only rear sensor photos are excellent and the screen has nothing to envy the Xs. I highly recommend it	1
I'm not disappointed! Complies with the order! Delivered on time! No worries getting started! Coral color is beautiful! I recommend this smart phone!	1
TopMany smoother than previous generationsSatisfaite à 100%	1
Very large screen in a clutter more content than the iPhone 7 more ... Facial recognition even better than touch Id.	1
I am really happy, what is beautiful and big this laptop !. In short, I love him !	1

The kiff, apple is life.	1
Super	1
I just love it!	1
After a lot of searching, I chose this phone to replace my 6s (team of a new battery replaced by Apple). With the same use I spend 7 hours of autonomy at .... 50 hours and I have 20% left! It's day and night. Otherwise I tested the image quality, screen versus screen between the Xs and this one. Objectively I have not seen a difference (and I searched!) Both screens are beautiful and bright.The only negative point for me is the size, it is a little bigger than the X or XS (and therefore inevitably 6S) is embarrassing for one-handed use. Other than that great phone.	1
Coming from the iPhone 7 Plus, I hesitated for a long time between the XS and the XR, which attracted me especially for its red color in which it is simply sublime! Its strong points in my opinion: - the BATTERY! I use my phone a lot for my work, especially on social networks and the battery is extremely good! Longer than the 7 plus or the XS, from 10h to 20h I lost 42% while it was loaded the day before sleep (using a lot of instagram and snapchat) - Face ID is ultra fast and simple d use, even in low light - the quality of the screen is top, I do not see why it is criticized his LCD, I have not seen a lot of differences, at least they are not obvious, with the higher models , except if you want to test data sheets ..- the design simply sublime, for me in red. Regarding the black bands, we get done quickly and I do not find them so shocking. It is not cheap like the 5C, we see that it is of quality and the glass back is magnifique.es points "" weak "": - it is absolutely necessary, like any iPhone, a protective shell, especially with a glass back that may scratch .. and ... that's all, for now I can not find anything else to say, maybe my opinion will change over time but I find it really top.J ' I have personally opted for the 128 GB, which I recommend considering the low price difference with the 64 goVoilà, if you found my comment useful, do not hesitate to let it know by clicking on "" yes "" below, it's always a pleasure :)	1
I was expecting a lot from this 6.1 inch screen, and it exceeds all my expectations !! First, 6.1 inches is "" finally "" the ideal size to comfortably browse the net. When I go from the XR to the iPhone 7, the 4.7 inches of the 7 (identical for the iPhone 8) are decidedly too small, the difference is striking! Then we can talk about the Oled as being the new technology, the quality of the LCD screen of the XR is striking! The colors are beautiful, deep, stable regardless of the viewing angle, with very nice contrast. Only one point that could be boring for some, the XR is significantly heavier than 7 or 8. For my part, its weight does not not at all embarrassed. But I strongly advise those who like smartphones, to take an XR in hand before buying it.	1
A good phone overall, even if the price is a bit too high, at least 200 euros.J'ai Iphone is still working very well and that is enough for the moment.J'avoue have trouble with the larger screens, although Apple is quite talented in the field and is better than the competing manufacturers in terms of clutter.Plus jack, but that we start to get used.If you have iphone 6 or higher, the iphone xr could suit you. If you just want to discover the iOS system, it can be a good choice too.I recommend!	1
Phone bought for my wife when it came out I give you my opinionAlready first point that shocked me, NO OLED no but allo what, you will have an LCD (lower contrast of an OLED) but a very good brightness so at sun no problem, the level of responsiveness is one of the bosses of the market especially with its fingerprint sensor. I did not find the sound particularly good and then no analog output. A camera while on my P20 PRO I have 3 x) Regarding the battery, it's Iphone what, it's not their strong point, after she want about a day. better still than the other iphones.les apps turn well I find the menu is very fast, no major bug, I like the design what is really nice at iphone I think it is that there is a lot of hull available for purchase.voila I gave my opinion does not hesitate to put me a [useful vote] if I could help you or entertain you.	1
An iPhone really good, beautiful in its colors, its screen and its dimensions, nothing to complain about, Face ID that works very well (except when wearing sunglasses)	1
Iphone that corresponds to my expectations, no anomaly! Happy with my purchase knowing that it was on sale!	1
And I'm not disappointed . Super phone and the battery is really worth it	1
Best product with multipurpose essential today	1
Received perfectly packaged and everything is ok	1
Bluffed by the speed of execution of the applications, by the excellent sound and the very beautiful screen. Sold and shipped by Amazon and therefore no problem, it's new, original and never unwrapped. With third-party sellers it's less glorious! I do not detail any more, everything was written on the XR, I just give you my personal opinion [I hesitated between 8, 8plus, X, Xr, Xs, Xs +]: it is currently the best choice (still about reasonable) and the best value for money at Apple. The price of more expensive models (XS, XS + is not justified compared to the meager improvements that will be found in tests in the lab but not in real life, by the standard user). Two examples the difference of screens (Oled) and the photo mode (double sensor) it's joke, the screen and the photos on Xr it's excellent, no need more! I hope I have not forgotten anything and that this comment will allow you to make your choice. You can reach me through my profile for any information you would miss. If I can answer it, it will be with pleasure! Thank you for reading me!	1
Baby bomb	1
Very good phone of the Apple brand.A beautiful screen, very good pictures and a very fast execution. The color red, how to say .. just beautiful.A autonomy of a day very easily.In use I do it easily hold a day and a half to see two.Sold with my earphone and the charger.I recommend.	1
I love nothing to say.	1
Satisfy my purchase	1
I just love it	1
My son to buy this iphone, he is very happy, received in time.	1
Much loved	1
I had a 6s before so much vs say that I really see a difference and the screen is more than correct. The only and huge negative is the price there is really better performance in other brands and for less expensive but leave Apple I'm not ready	1
Coming from an iPhone 7, the difference in size and weight is seen directly once both products in hand.The screen quality is just excellent, certainly it's not oLed but view the difference in price must be ultra demanding to see a real big difference and the cover of the slab retina on the face is very good. This changes the previous high and low borders.It is good to finally have a memory size of 64go by default.The absence of the home button baffles the first few hours but we do it quickly.The 3D Touch will surely be missing to those who I used to do it daily, which was not my case personally. Personally, I did not see myself putting 1000th in a phone, at 690th (promo price last week on the black XR) there clearly I am delighted!	1
Apple quality with wireless charging.	1
Nothing to say, it's Apple, never disappointed in the quality	1
VERY VERY VERY happy with my purchase, contrary to the iPhoneXR commentary all made nine brilliant beautiful. Apple still hit bravo.	1
Confirm the description	1
Downright insane	1
Complies with the announcement, new phone, blister, for a gift it's perfect it is delighted! Small flat, the delivery man simply leave the package in the mailbox while he had to sign me for the reception .Apart this at the Top	1
Sold by A-Montain at almost 200 € cheaper than the original price, we are entitled to ask questions about the quality of the product.Iphone X I bought is new, blister film plastic, all new accessories and still under plastic. Nothing is missing from the call, after many checks, so there is absolutely nothing to report! (The records are just not in French) For 10 € more received in less than 36h, shipped by Amazon.Parfait and I recommended.	1
Iphone X cheaper than in store, it's not a shabby copy as I was afraid to discover by opening his box, it's an apple Iphone X no worries, well packaged, received 1day after the date expected delivery, but otherwise very happy with my purchase, it's a very good phoneOn a negative point but it's Apple's fault, it provides us with a charger not powerful enough to normally charge the battery of the phone is much more powerful than that of the other models before the iphone X, it will take about 120 € more at Apple to have a charger that correctly and normally charge (in time) your phoneWith the charger provided my phone puts about 3-4h good have a charge 100% is a shame but it's not the fault of the seller, in any case very good buy I do not regret	1
Very good phone, facial recognition is done very quickly, even in low light it works. The iPhone X is great, the battery is good. Plus the price is really correct compared to the store	1
iPhone X really beautiful and it's the best iPhone ever created.Facial recognition is really cool. I bought 2 of 64 GB by the seller A montain. Much cheaper than on the Apple website	1
The most advanced smartphone in its original packaging Apple, very neat, delivered from Italy well before the date provided by Amazon.	1
Check in time box blister product real certified apple the only problem is that the package has arrived without signature view the price of the article is not reassuring	1
Fast delivery and in BAL! Nothing to say, the phone is new with its original packaging in blister! With notice in French, English, Spanish and Italian. I can only recommend it.	1
New product sold by Amazon, no surprise is an Iphone x	1
Hello, iPhone X received within the specified time. Nothing to say, real iPhone that works 100%, super speed and time saving work incredible! Nothing to say, I recommend this product;)!	1
As always at Apple, a very good phone.Forcemment the price goes withThe facial recognition works super bienDelivery made in 5 days (because more stock) so very fast. Phone very well protected during the deliveryI just have a problem in the car, to read the sms via the car it is necessary before I unlock the phone. I have not found how to change her.	1
Hello the phone is beautiful and powerful there is not to say he and well nine in blister. The quality of the screen is perfect!	1
Delighted with my purchase. I was waiting for the release of the new iPhones of 2018 (Xs, Xs Max and Xr) to buy the X and am happy to have found it cheaper here than in store. Authentic and new product, blistered. The shipment was fast and properly secure (signature at the delivery of the package) but for an item at this price, it would have been better if the cardboard was filled with bubble wrap to prevent the box of the iPhone is going around in. Other than that, nothing to complain about. I highly recommend !	1
Professional useFinishing good enough (lower than my Samsung note 8) iOS has become a good osLéger and good autonomy	1
Nothing to report this iPhone X is very real and true! Its price can be puzzling but no I assure you it's a brand new original, I received it after 3 days with the delivery bonus, mandatory signature so perfect! By cons as said in previous comments, the phone box is just in a box without bubble wrap ... Anyway I'm too happy with this case, unbeatable price! I recommend :)	1
Ben nothing to say, I love my X, replaced my iPhone 6s by this iPhone, I like the facial recognition, the bank of password unlockable by faceID (replaces 1Password).	1
Received in a timely manner this iPhone is simply superb, aesthetically it is beautiful, being a regular Samsung pass on IOS was a rebirth for meFluidity and simplicity are at the rendezvous! FaceId works instantly, although I often have some hair on the faceid face fits without problem! I recommend!	1
After years in Apple I tried the Android adventure last July and finally I come back on iOS. Use pro and personal and it's really a great phone. After reading the reviews (on the fact that the phones were re-packaged) I checked the serial number on the Apple website and the phone is a new model as expected. The delivery took place on the day scheduled by the Company Private Parcels which is also very disparaged on the site but frankly everything went as planned for me.	1
First it is very beautiful, very pure, I had a 6s, I was not confused by the operation of the X, it is very easy to configure, I love the face ID, after we get used to very quickly to sweep. I am really happy with my purchase on your site. Photos, great. screenshot, easy. the sim card of the 6 runs on the X.	1
Hello everyone ! I am used to Apple and seeing the price I thought the phone was questionable and I started I bought it and I do not regret it! The iphone is like in new shop in this box of orgine it is an original. So really do not hesitate!	1
I bought this phone being careful to take the model shipped and sold by Amazon, not wanting to order from a third-party seller, to be sure to have a new phone without risk. The price was a little higher but I do not regret anything, arrived the next day, the phone was new, and it is a happiness. I chose the payment option in 4 times which gives a lot of flexibility. No regrets, nickel, perfect.	1
New product, under bilster. Works perfectly, certified Apple product. Already converted to Apple in recent years, the iPhone X is the best phone that the brand could do.	1
THE IPHONE WORKS PERFECTLY I ADVISE YOU TO BUY IT IT WORKS VERY WELL REALLY NO SOUS WITH TOP REALLY TOP THIS TELEPHONE	1
I did not evaluate the seal simply because not testedVery good buy for me. The payment in several times allows people who do not necessarily have monster means to buy this phone or offer it to someoneVery good offer and very satisfied with my purchase!	1
I received my iPhone X intact and even with a little advance on the delivery date, it's great! It's an authentic Apple, blister boxI recommend 100%	1

Frankly it is very very good my as you can know because of the dust or dirt that has in our pockets this can create micro scratches that can be removed through a product. Battery autonomy nothing to say full day see more.	1
Ordered in November, the iPhone I received is a new iPhone (remember to check its origin with the serial number), came from Italy.Fonctionne therefore as a new iPhone X should work, no problem. revenge as indicated on other comments, paper to stall in the box so had to receive some shocks during transport ...	1

Excellent Iphone, the must. The central button does not exist anymore, but it's a real plus. The screen is fluid and hyper reactive. Delighted with this purchase	1
Iphone X for 200 to 300 € less than elsewhere ... It was the good plan of the year. Received in 4 working days (they "" said "", cautious, delivery within 15 days). Shipped from Italy, the thing arrived under DHL, nine, under blist ... just the update under Itunes and that's it. Go ahead ... go for it ... I'll make another comment in six months, if the battery is "" loose "" ... because at that price, there's bound to be a "trick", but good, for now everything is consistent as wanted St Steve: robust and reliable, no tangles in sight.	1
Brand new product in blister.Really very satisfied.	1
The iPhone always on top in itself! Thank you to the sold to meet deadlines and with whom I made a great deal compared to Apple. Product came from London but perfectly functional with French networks and domestic European charger! Trust him	1
The only true evolution of iPhones since the iPhone 6 and its format change. Having been disappointed by the 7 which is a true copy of the 6, I can assure you that going to 10 is a small revolution in itself. Face ID works perfectly, the portraits photos are beautiful, the battery is particularly good, the borderless screen is great despite the notch.	1
Bought much cheaper than in store. I took it with 256 GB of memory, which changes me from my last iPhone with only 16GB ... nothing to say. Delivery in 1 working day respected, delivered at 13h battery. Still lacks a little protection in the package, it is still an expensive product that may require more paper etc in the package.	1
Not disappointed. Having an iPhone 6s, I hesitated between the 8 and the X. I do not regret my purchase. The screen is fantastic	1
Very good phone, faster and more fluid than ever. The absence of button surprises a little at first, but it is done very well. The camera is excellent. The rendering of the screen is by far the best of all iPhone.	1
The phone is received according to an Apple order. Everything is certified Apple.Je can not fault the phone is sublime and has no malfunctions! It is really perfect, I recommend it!	1
This is the same device that buy in France with all cables and earphones (son) .The 1 year free warranty works in FRANCE, tested and approved	1
A perfect productA perfect iPhone .. the most incredible of iPhonesEasy to use, it fits in the pocket and does everything I ask it without bug or lagI recommend (well not wait for X2 or X2 plus)	1
The received phone is as described. Received in its original box with all accessories. Packing and sealed intact at the reception.	1
At first I was an anti iphone. But I cracked for the latter and I am satisfied with the product.A pure desire to have facial recognition that works even in the dark !! Easy recognition adapts each time and it becomes faster and faster: )	1
Technology at the top, beautiful oled screen and especially the Face ID is just greatPerfect, better than a s8 if you're used to the apple	1
Fast delivery, I doubted at first to find the iPhone X at this price nine but it is well and good in blister pack with French plug. I recommend.	1
Article arrived 1 day before the date indicated, authentic article, in its plasticized packaging as leaving Apple. It works very well I am very happy the battery is a big highlight it is 2 days see 3 which changes iPhones previous more need to charge his phone every day!	1
Phone arrived 2 days after the order so well before the estimated date (which is a very good point) in the original packaging and blister, the Iphone is of course Nine and never used. Very good experience, I recommend 100% this phone. I have always been a Samsung pro but I can not hide the fact that the iPhone X has bluffed me and convinced me!	1
As an Apple advisor, their latest version is perfect. Amazon allows you to buy it at a lower price. it's all perfect	1
Best phone I have tested, the camera is at the top, it is fluid, the faceID works perfectly well, the screen is immersive.Franchement it is not expensive for what it is, I do not regret this purchase	1
Iphone arrived in excellent condition, neuf.Possédant iphone 6, iphone X is just incomparable on all points. He is very beautiful, we get used to it quickly. It's the day and the night. I strongly recommend the iphone X at this price (always expensive certainly).	1
super arrived in advance the product is new	1
Conforming product..delivery ups rotten .. we run after his parcel.For summary the product is top but I will not recommend anymore because of ups	1
Perfect	1
I just went from an iPhone 6 to this iPhone X and I'm more than satisfied! A real treat and Face ID is the best security solution	1
Object corresponding to the description in perfect condition.	1
Received for 5 days it is great, fluid, facial recognition is great I was bluffed. It takes just a time of adaptation as there is no home button.	1
I was septic saw the price 905 € instead of 1159 € on the Apple store. Order Friday received Sunday at noon. No, it's a bit of a repackage. It is new in blister. I recommend. Order so much if there are still ...	1
If you want to receive an iphone x nine with all accessories I advise you to go through the seller A-MONTAIN and forget all the other dishonest sellers who will send you a phone recondition	1
Yes it's too good	1
Original and new iPhone	1
Since I bought this smartphone, my experience in this field has changed completely. I can not live without it today!	1
Nothing to say	1
Good evening I would just recommend iphone X to those who wish to buy it. Everything is whaaouuu!	1
No complaints, great phone, perfect seller, ordered on Thursday night at midnight, received on Saturday morning early. iPhone obviously new and blistered like at Apple, except almost 200 € less! I recommend. So with the difference, it will pay me the Apple Care +, great!	1
Owner for 8 days of the iPhone X, I was very afraid of not being able to make me the absence of Home button.Finally I got very quickly and new gestures associated with this full screen are well more "" natural "" to use, a scan for the top rather than a click of a button. Face ID recognition is really effective, good quality photos, beautiful screen ... Nothing to say for my part No malfunction to report.For those who already had a recent iPhone before, it wins a little in weight and thickness (compared to an iPhone 7 is obvious) but I bought it in knowledge of cause.	1
This is Apple's bestseller I confirm. Apart from the Face-id a bit slower to open the menu than the Digital-id versions before, the clarity and fluidity is there. The Super Retina screen, the few new unique features of the iPhone X or 10 and manipulations (eg access to the calculator or navigation) are the real differences. Fortunately the little animation during the installation, shows the basic manipulations to know.	1
Delivered in advance, Amazon always topI do not come back on the smartphone in all its aspects since excellent reviews have already been published but I said that I am extremely satisfied with this smartphone for the use that I make (surfing, networks, games mainly) and I also use it extensively to capture slow motion videos and 4K freeruning and it fills me perfectly in this area. In short, I strongly recommend this smartphone	1
This smartphone is not great, it is perfect. It fits perfectly in my pocket, the quality of the screen is completely bluffing. It's a real jewel in terms of design and for the power I do not have much to add except that I do not have the im To use it perfectly because I do not use Gourmet applications. As far as the battery is concerned, the oled screen does a lot of money and offers bluffing wallpaper, not to mention deep black.	1
Beautiful phone design excellent screen beautiful camera excellent Face ID fast there are many new and new gestures to learn it is very simple to use this phone is just a jewel of technology and it is beautiful I really recommend this product	1
Apple quality of course, so product well thought out, reliable, bug-free. Coming from an iPhone 6, I feared a time of adaptation with the new gestures to learn as shortcuts screen, but it is actually very natural, very instinctive .The colors of the screen are beautiful, the photos are top.La novelty top: the face id, which works very well, including in the dark. It's very fast, we look at the phone and it's already unlocked. Much faster than the Touch id.In flat: the animoji, you really exaggerate the movements of the jaw so that the character gives the impression to speak like you. In mega flat: the price!	1
The iPhone x and arrive in a secure package in this new box very nice color I turned on everything and perfect extremely fast fluid I can say this price case a case my product was nine of the most beautiful effect I recommend this product which has an unbeatable price	1
The Iphone X is perfect, in the continuity of the products of the brand with an easy handling and the faceId system is stunning and simple. Superb phone.	1
I bought this Iphone X for my daughter. She is delighted and technically she finds it really evolved compared to its old iphone 7 plus. I was surprised to be suspicious about the price (974 €) compared to the price posted everywhere to know 1159 € ... I specify that it is a new device in blister. The delivery times have been perfectly respected. Very satisfied, I recommend this article.	1
As always at Apple, a very good phone.Forly the price goes withThe facial recognition works great wellFree delivery so very fast. Phone very well protected during the deliveryI just have a problem in the car, to read the sms via the car it is necessary before I unlock the phone. I have not found how to change her.	1
Having had a multitude of phones I can guarantee that this IPhone X is a marvel of technology! Face ID is just great for applications no need to write the password Apple Pay is the same no need to remove the blue card and type in the codeWhat about the 4K video that has a rendering of excellent quality! I do not regret my purchase	1
At first glance the device seemed not to be new (blister and dirty), but under the first blister, there is that of Apple as new. According to the model of the phone (M ...) that- it is new and not refurbished.	1
Arrived with 4 or 5 days in advance. Corresponds to the description. I obviously recommend this new iPhone. On the other hand, if you already have a 7 or an 8 it is not essential. Very good product, nothing is missing.	1
In search of the perfect smartphone, I tried at samsung the S8 plus and the NOTE 8, at Apple iPhone 8 plus, I could not find a phone free of defects in the very high end. so decided to try to switch to the iPhone X and there was a big slap, the quality of the object in itself has no equal you can believe me it sets the bar very high it feels good where are our 1000 € unlike other smartphones that I mentioned above.The screen is simply beautiful, having the NOTE 8, the colorimetry of the latter was completely saturated the phone was very sore eyes and no adjustment allowed to have just colors. Here the colorimetry is perfect just what is needed without going in the eye of the eye the calibration performed by apple is impeccable.Les gestures to handle the phones are very intuitive, they allow optimal navigation and instant in different applications installed , unlike the Note or it was much more laborious.for the compared to the iPhone 8 plus, there are no huge differences apart from the photo a step above, you will especially a much nicer object more upscale, screen covering almost the entire front and a new way to use an iPhone.en in short for all those who hesitate you can go with your eyes closed it is the best smartphone of the moment.	1
No comment !! Excellent product. Best smartphone 2017 .. Unquestionably !! We can only be fully satisfied. A purchase more than satisfactory	1
Nothing to report	1

Beautiful phone received new with all c is accessory and before the expected date	1
Beautiful screen. FaceID works nickel. New "gestures", which we get used to very quickly. Autonomy finally really good for an iPhone! It takes 1 1/2 day, or 2. The Animojis are funny. The photos are in the top of the basket of what the current market offers, ie, very good. A phenomenal power! Everything turns like a clock! A must ! A little gem!	1
Phone complies with the announcement. Delivery within the deadline.	1
Go there with your eyes closed 100% reliable	1
no problem corresponds to the description	1
the class c a good price perfect may good dear may c the life c comca viva iphone sisi the class	1
The best smartphone I have had so far! My last iPhone was a 6s which was already really good and after this I went to Samsung with the s8 + which was excellent too but too big for me in the end. So suddenly I cracked for this new IPhone X and frankly no regret the size is really perfect, I can use it with a hand without worries! Which is a good thing.The famous notch is not really embarrassing, after it's really a matter of taste I think! Face ID is great, it works great and even in the dark and it is extremely fast! The phone is ultra fluid, the disappearance of the home button can be a little confusing at first but is done very quickly and once we know the gestures to do it becomes a pleasure to use it! It's pretty hard to go back to an iPhone with the physical home button after that ^^	1
Even if the price remains high for a phoneThe facial recognition system is bluffing compared to unlocking by iPhone 7 footprint. Fast and with a good video quality, the absence of central button is not a problem on the contraryContaining the sending and the price, there is no better on the market.	1
Fast shipping and neat, iPhone X like new, no visible wear. Works perfectly after a restore on iTunes. Thank you so much !!	1
I have only since yesterday and I do not know how to do without it so it's the top of the quality but beware it was already delivered since Saturday, February 2 in front of my house as expected and it's really the top as a smartphone and I do not regret this purchase and even if it was a sixty euros more expensive than my mobile operator and internet and digital TV Belgium I preferred to buy from Amazon because customer service is really Impeccable in every way and when you have the slightest problem with Amazon delivery always find a solution to your problems	1
A little surprised the price for the 256go, but finally I received, 1 week after the purchase, my iphone X in the original apple blister box. I am very happy with my purchase, I quickly received an email and a text message from DHL to give me the date of delivery.	1
Hello, I was skeptical by ordering this phone view comments that said the product was reconditioned and in the end once received and after full verification on my part, the product is NINE. So thank you very much for the price	1
Just perfect. Packaged new in original box in blister. Perfect !	1
I received my iPhone X in 1 day worked super blister like new and not renewed nothing said super I recommend more more	1
I was skeptical about the comments of some customers but R.A.S for me ... iPhone nine, no worries. I am glad !!!	1
If you want a new revolutionary phone, and you can afford this iPhone X, it's clearly the best phone you can buy. I ordered it from A-Montain, it arrived brand new under blister (with a day late certainly), but in any case there is nothing to say about the product and sends.	1
An iPhone of great quality, perfect photo quality, battery that keeps you perfect	1
New product, sold and shipped by Amazon, still this small uncertainty but it was really a new, paid 849 €. What good!	1
Impeccable phone works very well received before the scheduled date so too cool	1
I do not dare to test the waterproof side! Otherwise it is a classic iPhone X.	1
A cheap Iphone X.	1
I changed the phone that offers face recognition that I activated	1
Top I recommend	1
Price too expensive unfortunately	1
very good product as usual with Apple good after CA remains a product among many probably better	1
The product is compliant and nickel	1
Perfect	1
The price is quite low I do not know why but in any case the box is an original, condition neuf.Livré with notices in Russian and PolishMais nothing wrong	1
Article received well in time, as always. The iphone X is beautiful, well in hand and so nice to use. Hurry, however, protect it with a shell and a screen if you hold it. The glass makes very good for the visual but we will not be safe from fingerprints more than 2 minutes unfortunately.After a few hours of use, it is very very fast to new gestures.Le Face ID works very good, that's bluffing. The photos, videos are beautiful and transcribe the colors very well. The price is very high for a phone of course but if you want to please yourself and stand out from the other models of the brand to the apple, it will be a great success.	1
My rating and maximum for the whole transactionWhat I like: ok ok Apple has still made strong on this iPhone X screen really more visible compared to my 6 even if the format is the same but have believe that it is not the same. all the same phone, very intuitive, very easy to use, speed of execution, normal at the same time for a new phone, yes if you have doubts I confirm that the phone is new in blister and not reconditioning or others, in short apart from the price that of course remains high in purchase without subscription this iPhone X is impeccable.Hope that Apple does not make this phone obsolete in the coming months.And to finish more if you had an iPhone or Mac then there transfer old data this background in the blink of an eye.What I do not like: nothing in the immediate. I really recommend it.As always thanks to the seller and Amazon always very good quality service. Regards.	1
The last pearl of Iphone .. Superb phone !! This OLED screen is crazy !!! beautiful pictures !!! facial recognition is top too !! works very well !! Package well packed and protected.Pleasant surprise to have received Saturday morning instead of Monday !! Very happy to be able to spend the weekend with !! :)I recommend !!	1
I really love! I had a 5S before the change is sizeReally very fluid, fast, battery that hold well. Face ID without any problem! No problem to adapt to the main key absent, very instinctive (although an Apple!) Many small features that, added to each other, make the difference. Certainly small gadgets for some, but very pleasant for others! Also great price! I will not guarantee to pay 1200 euros for this phone but at that price it is possibleEmail very quickly (more than 1 to 2 weeks in advance). Maybe it will miss more attention for the protective packaging of the phone in its box but it passes more discreetly (I was afraid of being scammed or that the package never arrives but no problem!) And what is not the fault of the sellers	1
iphone X original, new, delivery in a box of protection. with a cable charger, I do not regrease my purchase, with a much cheaper price I recommend it to you	1
Very happy and satisfied with my purchase. Iphone X refurbished works great, a small scratch on the back shell but almost invisible, the quality of photos and videos is incredible and portrait mode is really nice. I was able to pay in 4 times, so delighted!	1
Very satisfied with my purchase, surprises after iPhone 7, much heavier but it is done very quickly. Ultra fast delivery in advance even. I recommend.	1
Perfect. Conform to the description. Beautiful object. Well we will put the price aside ... As always Apple heals his products.	1
I will not comment too much on the product, I think there are enough tests and articles to know what it's worth. For the rest, delivery on time, compliant product, everything is ok!	1
Pack of 2 comes with a plastic tool that facilitates installation and avoids bubbles under the filmVitre thin and very effective. Quick delivery	1
Excellent product, facial recognition works very well and with the induction charge is the top. Too bad it is so expensive.	1
Very good shopping experience.I bought the iphone X 256 GB.It arrived 2 weeks after my order.New product. Model sold in Japan. It works very well on European frequencies. It comes with a USB adapter for French electrical outlets.	1
Item ordered and received 2 days later. Perfectly new (Serial number verified) Attention .Maniac, the phone is chrome on the side and therefore very fragile. I recommend a clear chrome stripe (8 euros on amazon) for maintenance every 6 months and obligation to protect with a shell and protective films. For the most maniac I recommend the gray version.Otherly the phone is really beautiful, it is a screen with beautiful finishes. In terms of advances, nothing special except the built-in camera that strongly competes with some pro devices today.I recommend and the seller is top. It's a good price for a phone that only has a few months.	1
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- It had been a long time since Apple had presented a smartphone as interesting as this iPhone X with a design and a neat finish. The iPhone X is an excellent smartphone packed with incredible technology such as Face ID and this incredible screen. Why, therefore, is deprived of it at this price, especially when reselling it will not lose much value. ------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ------------- STRONG POINTS: Very good finishes.A screen at the top.Face ID works perfectly well.Performance of high fly. IP67 sealing.High-angle camera.Solid autonomy.LOW POINTS : No jack 3.5 mm Photo quality zoom a little disappointing. I hope my comment was helpful. Click on "" yes "" if it is. This will help me to know that the time spent writing this comment was helpful and not a waste of time. Thank you for your understanding. DSR.	1
Whether we like the apple brand or not, it is clear that their products have a flawless manufacturing quality. And this is the case on this IPHONE X. beautiful screen, features and power to any test. product is GOOD in addition to BEAU. the inherent simplicity of IOS allows to take in hand almost instantly the product. I recommend 100%	1
The iphone X is like all iphone that came out, a success! Even if it degrades quickly I like this model.	1
Purchased during the amazon prime day at a great price I am quite satisfied! This is an iphone X original came sealed and new with a serial number and a warranty valid for 1 year only! The charger is a plug classic European compatible with our French plugs. The box contains lightning headphones and a lightning adapter -> mini jackVery satisfied I recommend. UPS delivery with signature delivery very serious!	1
Since I bought it I am very happy with it because it meets all my expectations. The grip is much more pleasant than the previous iPhones, the color mixing is very important and the features are amazing. The duration of the battery is more advantageous, view that I want more than a day with, compared to less than a day with other iPhones with a very regular use. The novelties are pleasant to discover and it remains a smartphone quality.	1
Beautiful iPhone X I was lucky to have bought it changes there life especially Face ID it is magical, fast finish or beautiful screen top the same picture never seen the same in a smartphone	1
the keys are fluid, the design and class, in short, my iphone x to me what! Xd! I recommend to all iphone acros!	1
Beautiful screen, camera of impeccable quality, good autonomy, premium design.A high quality smartphone sign Apple! If this comment was useful to you, thank you to click on "" Yes "" below, it is always a pleasure to know we're reading :-) Thanks!	1
A good device with facial recognition and removal of the home button. We also have a good stereo sound. I will not comment on the wireless charging, I could not test this function.This IPhone holds well in the hand despite its large screen, I prefer the 8 + .The interface is fluid and the battery is good the load.If I had to find a disadvantage, it is undoubtedly its price that will cool more than one, as well as the removal of touch id that I found practical when I wanted to unlock the IPhone in a pocket for example .Conclusion: If the price does not repel you, you can go there, it is rather a good product.	1
Very well	1
Far too expensive for the fragility and the functionsI have used it only 3 days, I sell it in its original packing invoicePlus several different hullsJAMAIS USED	1
I like the quality	1
Phone on top! I recommend it but be careful it is very fragile!	1
Very good phoneVery clean like newIn its original boxWith its headphones and charger	1
Excellent product AppleAll is there to add	1
I-Phone user since the beginning I have in addition to my I-Phone X acquired a Samsung 9 story to see and see for myself. There is no comparison possible. Nothing matches the I-Phone even if its price becomes exorbitant.	1
Perfect. Payment in 4 times really practical.	1
After one year of use nothing to say nickel market	1
Iphone 8 nine. Works perfectly. Nothing to say. Much cheaper because coming from the countries of the east. Sim FR, Belgian and Italian working perfectly (I have all three).	1
I was a little scared about it being a scam but I am very happy with my purchase. Unlocked phone, fully in line with my expectations. It's been over a month since I have it, it works perfectly!	1
Passing an Iphone SE ... The size is really nice, I was afraid that is too big, but finally I love! For the rest I do not see the differences with the SE, except the size of the phone and can be the quality of the photos.Once Amazon offers us a great opportunity with a great price Update: This phone does not heat at all !!! And the battery lasts 2x longer than my SE.	1
article received in 1 day true to our expectations	1
I was worried about ordering a product of such value, but I was reassured to know that Amazon was shipping it to me. I do not regret my purchase at all. The phone arrived 24 hours in advance and delivered by hand. The iPhone 8, comes with new towers equipment, it works perfectly, for the price it remains a very good deal, especially for those who want to equip a new iPhone. Just a small downside not very serious, the phone's color is rather golden pink than gold, but with a shell it is no longer seen. I highly recommend this seller.	1
I ordered the new iphone being afraid that it is repacked because of its price (150 € less than at Apple). I received it in 1 business day new blister, it is great! I am very happy!! You can order it by closing your eyes !!	1
Compliant box, laminated and still with the warranty label, which confirms that it is a new one. I recommand it !	1
A few weeks already that I received and tested the phone and everything is fine. Package well packaged and protected with blister, arrived at the indicated date. Regarding the phone from what I saw it is for the market of the EST but it does not affect the setting or anything. SIM card ok! Network ok! For a saving of 160 € it's worth knowing that the phone is totally new	1
Top product, top price and speed to top	1
I had fears before buying it, but I confirm the seriousness of the shop. Iphone brand new, in its original box, verified at Apple. Walk perfectly, it is of course brand new.I strongly recommend	1
Very good product, new, in French and cheap. Little apprehension when ordering but I am very satisfied. I recommend the product	1
I am very happy with my product came with its original packaging as agreed happened quickly thank you very good image quality.	1
I bought the iPhone 8 Plus and at this price I was afraid to receive it in refurbished but it arrived new with all the accessories and original box. I checked the warranty on the Apple site and I operated it by returning the date of purchase and I have 1 year warranty at Apple.No surprise with this product works great. I recommend this seller !	1
Order received much faster than advertised. New product and conforms to the description. No defect. I am glad !!!	1
Frankly happy. I ordered my iPhone 8 Plus and it arrived about a week later, knowing that it does not come from France. In a pinch, the only point where I can have something to complain about is the transport: I do not know what happened but there were two carriers who transmitted my package, which has resulted in a mess at the parcel tracking level. But in the end, after understanding what had happened, I was able to follow my package quite normally. The product is perfectly in line with the announcement, it works totally and is provided in the official box, with all accessories: USB cable to Lightning for recharging, a pair of Apple wired earphones with a Lightning connection (because there is no port jack on the iPhone), the small power supply that goes with the cable for charging, a small adapter to turn the Lightning port jack (which can serve, I admit) and all the documentation that goes with it, in short, all that is needed and all that it should normally have. The price / quality ratio is really good and the package was in good condition when it arrived, the carriers do not seem to have fun using it as a hammer or as a door-lock, which is appreciable.Bref, you can go.PS: for those who would like to contact the platform, remember to bring you a license in oriental languages ​​at a minimum.	1
I had iPhone 6 that was starting to age and I thought it was time to change. That's why I bought cat iPhone 8. By cons I had the choice, either buy it on Amazon, or on the Apple Store. I confess that I was at the limit to return my order on Amazon because after ordering it, I realized that it was 519 € with recovery and 685.28 € without recovery. At Amazon with discount it cost me € 629.00. I let you calculate the difference.	1
I took the time to take it and without regret I recommend it. It's a real Apple iPhone with integrated headphones and all the panoply. The lowest price of the market I highly recommend, it works very well it is perfect	1
Product beautiful and new non reconditioned his blister apple and with all the classic accessories, I recommend, the price is more than reasonable for the product in question	1
Beautiful design, fast delivery (I paid for express delivery in 2 days). Phone well packed in blister with all accessories. Satisfied a single flat the battery that does not fit as his! Really a pity.Thanks	1
Received quickly serious seller (A Montain) bought reconditioned as new the phone does not represent any defect no scratches in its original box for the price I paid it worth it I have 30 days to test it	1
Very satisfied with this iPhone 8 more simplicity efficiency speed even faster than my portable pick with a powerful sound on the job site just perfect I love take a good protection because with the weight heavier than iPhone 5,6,7si it falls it hurts very fast delivery and it is the original price and much cheaper on Amazon at SFR and orange without packages counting the turn of 900 € in my opinion there is a saving between 200 and 300 € easy	1
The iphone 8 is much faster than iphone Se, for the rest no super big difference except maybe the wireless charge.I was pretty retousing to order amazon this product, the price difference is huge, I 'm Expected delivery was fast and I have a real Apple product.I do not regret to trust the comments.I recommend.For the seller for me it was Fib- tech.	1
Recognized directly and no worries of operation after more than one month of use.	1
Received as expected and perfected in the original box with the accessories that go with it.	1
Perfect, new products received, I checked on apple with there serial number the product is original and under warranty, I recommend it is really cheap compared to the store	1
iPhone 8 Plus bought from the seller A-MOUTAIN and received in 3 days attention for the fast delivery the delivery man will be chronopost obligatorily the phone is in blister and in perfect state of progress.	1
Very good quality / price ratio compared to the competition. Fully satisfied with my iPhone.	1
Thank you Amazon	1
I was afraid it was a counterfeit but not at all a phone certe a little expensive to buy but it's worth the quality of the photos is crazyUn iPhone at the top	1

Do not forget the tempered glass	1

Smartphone new and already unlocked with a significant economy performed. Very satisfied with my purchase, I recommend this product.	1
Hello. Send to the top by Amazon one day in advance. And the right model (iPhone 8 Plus). A phone that is a good compromise for people who do not want to buy the iPhone 10. For me the big highlight of this model is the camera with portrait modes rather interesting . Indeed I come out of the iPhone 6, the difference is rather noticeable. Despite a very high price I highly recommend it. I keep phone phone on average 3 years so I find the investment rather profitable. Otherwise expensive commitment an operator for 2 years ...	1
I am delighted with my purchase, my phone arrived quickly in a secure package and not damaged, I have no problem with since I use it! Great	1
Iphone 8 more well received! Nine (warranty verification with serial number) no worries everything is perfect. I recommend	1
It must still admit that the size of the screen is very large but finally we get used to it and we do not want to return to a screen of a diagonal inferior.Le touch id hyper responsive, the quality of photos and ios 11. If in addition you are in an environment Apple is the top. With icloud, you will share your photos in the cloud and display your content on the apple tv with airdrop.The charge is good on the 7 plus. In short, it's all good.	1
It is the most successful smartphone ever created, Apple masters its technology perfectly, we can do so much with nowadays, it is almost essential. A very good product that I advise for people who hesitate to choose their smartphones, no superfluous, simple, fast and functional, for customization and be a little more free on certain aspects, it will turn to Androïd.	1
This is an original i phone 8 with its original box All accessories are in the box Do not include account of the photos Behind the phone there is a write california, c E .... And I was delivered a day before the planned dateNot to report bad	1
No problem at the moment I am very satisfied the product seems to me consistent with the Apple brand so I recommend this seller	1
Received in a box with the number that perfectly matches the one that was written in the sales announcement. New arrival with charger and earphones. Delivered in 48h as expected. The phone works perfectly and meets the expectations of my daughter who previously before the 6s.	1
Despite a stress pending delivery, I was very satisfied at the time of receipt, the phone is new, very well packaged, I recommend	1
iPhone received on time.New, blistered with all European plug elements, power cord, earphones, jack adapter, French manual and stickers. Unlocked any operator. Works perfectly.	1
Very effective, nothing new in use compared to the iphone 5 that I had but it is much faster. obviously it is faster and more efficient on all points. The new chip allows to really have a smooth use, I am satisfied because my phone is my working tool.	1
This is an original iPhone 8 APPLE.reçu well packaged / works perfectlyBought 200 € less than the appstore ==> I recommend this purchase	1
Phone at the top. Functional fast and Apple still has a great service update. I am not very objective, but since I had a Windows phone that is a resistant phone with a great camera but no application. I'm obviously very happy to be on a phone with which I can do absolutely everything.	1
I am very happy with my purchase, it arrived within the time indicatedIt is an Iphone 8 plus, it is new, short of happiness! I highly recommend!	1
Super I phone 8+ at an unbeatable price. The phone arrived new in blister. But as the trust should not avoid control, I checked the serial numbers and the warranty on the Apple site was it turned out that everything was nickel (original phone and under warranty). As for the phone itself, I think it's the best iPhone that Apple has created in terms of sound, image quality and fluidity.	1
super product seller responding to the message reactive, nothing to say that good for the moment I would not fail to return if problem	1
Excellent little smarphone "compact" to have in 2018. I bought it in January while it was 726 € and I have already recommended at this price with eyes closed but then the 685 € there is no excuse DARK! Product beautiful and new as indicated, as if you had made the purchase at the Apple Store. Beautiful in white too.	1
I am very happy. The cost is much less than the X or XS and I still have the button	1
I was a little reluctant given the little comment, but finally very surprised, ordered on Monday and received on Tuesday, very well packaged, checked with the serial number c is a perfectly new product and not reconditioned. I highly recommend. Small flat for Amazon customer service that did not take into account my request relay point when, however, according to the young man had on the phone everything was ok ...	1
iPhone is what I expected I am very happy about itIt is very easy to use and very easy to start	1
Buy an iPhone 150 € cheaper than other shops is a very good deal. Iphone destined for a country of Eastern Europe, but always remains an iphone.	1
Received quickly it is a model for the Eastern countries but no problem it is the European model for 120 euros less I highly recommend.	1
iPhone received very quickly - New iPhone, perfectly matches the product described, received in original Apple box. The iPhone 8 is much faster than the 6. I ordered with screen protector and a silicone shell, I am delighted!	1
Perfect reception! I received the phone one day before the scheduled date. The phone is very beautiful and very fast. Thanks to its big screen I enjoy watching my videos on the go without having to take my iPad! I also made some pictures that give a pretty amazing result compared to my old iPhone SE. The back in white glass is very beautiful.For some, this iPhone is old in its design but for those who, like me, are not yet ready to pass the bar of 1000 euros for their phone, I think it's a excellent choice.The only downside comes from the jack lightning connection. By juggling between the jack cable of the car and the headphones I was already often on the verge of losing it. In addition we must make a choice: we plug the headphones or charge, but it is the only "negative point". The rest is perfect	1
Complete product arrived in blister. Nothing was missing in the package. It happened 15 days before the announced date. I recommend this seller. I am very satisfied with my purchase.	1
Great phone. I'm really happy with this purchase and I recommend it to Apple fans !!	1
This product is great! The phone arrived in good condition I recommend it	1
Super iphone is great! It's really cool the payment in 3 times. I'm so glad of my purchase. thank you so much	1
New in blister and 1 year warranty at apple from the date of purchase	1
New finishes in glass more qualitative, its screen is always better calibrated with the adoption of true tone that rests the eyes by adapting to the ambient light by softening the tones (from the iPad Pro). it's the loading qi that also like it.In fact even if it does not revolutionize the range this 8 plus is an efficient and complete model with its bluetooth 5, HP still improved stereos, his camera also reviewed with his native portrait mode and its 4K video up to 60 ips hyper fluid its chip A11 bionic the fastest in the world ready for the rest without any slowdowns or heating. Waiting to offer me next year 1 Xs	1
But the user is happy with his new toy! I think it's too expensive for an apple already started ... I'm happy with a chinese smartphone Chinese brand that makes the same use but tastes and colors each selected! Delivered well protected and in the announced times, so very good!	1
At first glance the delivery (although very fast thanks to Prime) of an iPhone 8 in a simple little box without protection seemed disturbing to me, we all know the care and attention that the driver carries to his parcel. this case if the "box" that contains the phone had a slight acro. However the box is relatively thick so no "visual damage" on the phone. For now I am very satisfied with this iPhone 8 I go from 4 to 8 is a huge good technology. When I took it I was a case (the records in the box were Italian) but it is completely consistent it is a real product that I recommend.	1
Conform product nothing to say, c'esg Well an authentic product Apple no doubt number imei tested at Apple! Delivery time respected!	1
Without any complaints	1
Super product I am serious Contente In addition to its .sa very well .... I think buy another really top	1
The Iphone is new, it has never been opened very well packaged. I made this Iphone for my son on Thursday, January 11, 2018, it was written that it should arrive between January 24 and 28, instead of his I received it 5 days later, Tuesday, January 16. If you are esteemed, do not do it, go for it.	1
iPhone 8 Plus received in time in almost new condition, only one small scratch on the back but with the hull, it is no longer visible to me! Comes with a protective glass (sorry but as you can see in the photo, I stuck no matter how !!) a transparent shell and Bluetooth headphones (not those of Apple but apart from the style, c is the same!). Do not hesitate I do not regret my purchase !!	1
Superb phone, very good ergonomics, nice quality of screens (even if you can find better), good sound and attention the battery is just perfect I can do two days without any worries and playing on it!	1
The price is really resonable compared to the product! Frankly, if you go through there you will make great savings, we talk about an iPhone 8+!	1
Really very happy with my purchase !! Fast delivery, I was a little afraid of the price, if it really is a new phone in its packaging Apple! Too much happy	1
Product according to the description.	1
Very positive opinion about this product. I think it is to date the most successful iPhone, huge performance, product quality, wireless charging, very good quality cameras .Design certainly a bit old but with the back in glass I find it beautiful. This smartphone amazes me on its duration of autonomy, I want easily 2.5j see 3j .In short I recommend	1
Excellent product! Delivery before the scheduled date! Very satisfied	1
I can say that the seller is honest, we can buy this product.	1

Alsolument conform ... product nine ... without any problem it is a iphone 8 in blisterComplètement sastisfait ... in relation to the seller ... extremely serious ... nothing to complain.Bref, I really recommend	1
Phone arrived on time. The Apple quality is known by cons I discovered the reconditioned offers of this seller and frankly nickel (or the box if you want to be picky), the phone was really like new for a price defying competition.Par against the sending deserved to be better packed: for the price, a little bubble wrap would not have been luxury.	1
A transaction at the top! A really new iPhone and very well protected when sending. I do not regret my purchase after 3 weeks of use. A big crush for live photos (in open mode because I had the 5c before).	1
Order pass Saturday morning, and I received Tuesday .. Delivery to the top with a very good follow. I am totally conquered, very well protected with the bubble paper. The phone is just sublime. Thank you Amazon	1
Really top, besides the performance of the Iphone 8 itself, it was delivered as a bonus and it is a new product and not repackaged.A price, I did not find better!	1
Article compliant. Genuine iPhone 8 in its original packaging with headphones and charger. It was just necessary to update the IOS when turning on the Iphone. No difference with the iphone sold in France, except the price (150 € cheaper). Ordered at 16:00 and received the next day at 9:30 by private carrier (premium required)!	1
I go from an iPhone 7 to 8 plus, knowing that before I had a 6 more ... I am very happy to find the most on this phone that I missed a lot! Great phone, and seller at the top! sealed just perfect!	1

very beautiful and well packaged delivered quickly beautiful iphone the price is a bit expensive but like all phones of the brand	1
Back on iPhone after a brief visit on Android. Excellent such, I find the battery better than the 7, which I had in the past. A little heavier but the grip is only safer I think. Reactive, simple, no bug, all I like about what ios. This excessive price changes are annoying. -70 € the day after my purchase, it's a little rager ...	1
Very nice device. Happy with my purchase. Sober color. Very responsive. When we know Apple, we know what to expect.	1
No problems when receiving the phone or with the use of it since my order.The widescreen allow me for my part to have less eye pain and the photos are of very good quality.Par cons I capture very bad since I have the phone (Free).	1
Very happy with my IPhone 8 Plus bought last February. Thank you for proposing resonnable prices compared to Apple.	1
It's an original iphone 8, much cheaper than my operator or fnac or darty or applestore. I have since July, RAS to date. The battery is a little weak if you use a lot of apps / internet. But it discharges slower than the 6 that I had before.Arrived under 1 day with Prime, settled in 4 fois.Je recommend!	1
Brand new phone at a great price, fast delivery, everything is perfect !!	1
When we go from a 5s to this wonder of Iphone 8 we can only have fun, this IPhone 8 256 GB nine 700 euros, I say thank you AMAZONE	1
Unbeatable price for this product. This iphone is top. More accessible than the latest models very (too) expensive! I recommend this model.	1
Iphone 8 plus, big screen very convenient for mails, sms, etc. Me perfectly but holds the place impossible for me to put in a pants pocket especially I bought a shockproof shell so quite heavy, but consistent with my expectations.	1
No problem. Getting started easy. Transferring data from my old iPhone without problems. Nice in hands. Clear and very bright screen.	1
Very good product.	1
I am currently writing with the Iphone 8 plus bought on Amazon and I am completely satisfied with the product! It is new, fully operational, in short it is as if I had bought directly from Apple.	1
Iphone 8 brand new, in perfect condition. Nothing irregular and much cheaper than elsewhere. How they do I do not know but I am satisfied with the purchase.	1

A good economy on the price compared to the Apple site. I read the ad to verify that it was not a refurbished phone. And it is a new as indicated in original packaging.	1
Stress by all the negative comments, I was relieved when I received the NEW device, with the sealed box and the original packaging. Good seller and a phone at the top, the new True One function is very effective and the performance is very good!	1
Not wishing to buy the new generation iphone X right now, I stayed on the known, iphone 8 plus. And frankly, except the OLED screen, it has nothing to envy the X. This iphone is a performance machine and aesthetically very well finished.	1
The box completely new, no problem "" half open box "". Phone received in 4 days. Nothing to say it works perfectly.	1
Delivered 2 days before, iPhone very functional and new, very advantageous price unlike the official Apple website and possibility to pay in 4 times I recommend!	1
We love or we do not like the IPhone each his choiceHere my comment is more applicable to the supplier of itService impeccableDelivery of a new device under cello no complaints except that via this channel you will save a bunch of euros	1
Very interesting price compared to Apple directly, it's a good phone. The major difference with the 8 against the 7 is The wireless charging is very convenient on the night table.	1
Hello, If you have questions about the product I will try to answer! To start the product is not French, so this is the reason for the low price compare to a phone "iPhone 8" nine. It is not French, but compatible with French operators (I do not know for the Belgians) and it can obviously be put in French at the start. The box is blistered, the phone too and the accessories are official! The phone has no defects (manufacturing) whether physical or computer. In summary you will see no change between this one and a nine apart from the price!	1
It's 3 months that I have it and I'm not disappointed it's an iPhone anyway, it does not beugue it is not so fragile that I like it a lot, and contrary to what other comment or question I received it at startup I put French and that's it	1
iPhone unlocked and new, I recommend closed eyes, quality product and compliant This is an authentic product and originalPhone performance, the photos are good qualities and the design of the phone is really beautifulAttention to protect it well as fragile	1
An Iphone 8 100 € cheaper than in traditional signs, I did not believe it, but if it is possible! No worries, you can order without flinching :)	1
SUPER TELEPHONE MY NANO SIM AND VOILA I CAN SERVE ME THAT IN MORE THAN THE PRICE THAT MORE	1
Item as described. Nothing to say. Quality product. Elegance and perfomance are waiting for you. Strongly recommend.	1
Good product r.a.s, fast delivery, consistent with the description as new condition I am satisfied with my purchase good value for money compared to what can be found in the trade I recommend it	1
new iPhone. In blister, nothing to report you can buy without fears	1
Genial.But compared to the iphone 7 I do not see a great evolution.I should have taken the 8 plus be little.	1
The apology of the iphone8 plus is more to do.I received it, new and well packaged (sent by Amazon), within reasonable time, given the snowy episode.The price charged by the Moobyl seller is very interesting. The invoice was sent to me quickly. My only concern is its weight (a little heavy with its 210 g.) And the virtual keyboard Apple that does not include, in the same presentation, letters and numbers, forcing multiple commutations in the entries. Devices running Android do not have this disadvantage. I strongly recommend both the product and the seller.	1
Superb device, functional, new design with glass back. Simple to use, fast and powerful. I recommend this product, satisfaction assured.	1
Product received new, in good conditionFunction perfectly for now, do not be afraid to order a product so expensive on amazon :)	1
Very beautiful phone. Conform to photos and description. Conquered by color. Frankly nothing wrong. In addition I asked for a gift bag and it came in a beautiful packaging. Thank you!	1
Fast delivery, beautiful phone state, I just kiff. The price is quite high, but the phone is worth the price (it's call)	1
I am a big fan of iphone I think it is better than iphone 7super camera and good storage space I recommend.	1
I am super happy to have bought the iPhone 8 are regret, the best mobile for the moment super fast the same photo a thing of sick class nothing to say Apple always on top and serious,	1
This is my first iPhone and I'm not disappointed! The screen although it is only LCD at the time when all the manufacturers have gone to the oled is a safe bet! Plus the new design with glass at the back Stay super nice! A small flat all the same because it is quite fragile and easily takes on scratches! I recommend it to those who can not afford to buy an X but still want a fluid iPhone latest generation through the chip A11 Bionic. The True Tone is a very good option and allows you to use longer are phone. In short it's a great smartphone far from useless	1
I have it for a year now. No problem with the use.	1
Very good	1
Super	1
But it's expensive bug!	1
I love this product if you hesitate to buy it and now ben N hesitate to buy moreover I'm writing with the quality is excellent I have never seen a reconditioned Amazone Phone also powerful	1
I was afraid to find this iphone in bad condition, but it is brand new, not a scratch in original blister. It arrived in time, I ordered it with TBE internationnal, no problems detected until today, the insurance Apple is valid for this iPhone, even compatible with insurance AppleCare. I went from the iPhone 5s to the iPhone 7, size difference, I have to get used to this difference in width. I recommend this product / seller.	1
Order Wednesday evening arrival Friday morning, at the top, the product is new pack in its original box with the original accessories also quite perfect, thank you Amazon! 150 € to save! The phone is very good I love the 3D Touch and the coiled pictures I did not have on iPhone 5s, the main button changes but you get used to it quickly me personally I prefer this is a short phone perfect! Ps: I the I took the seller A-MONTAIN (I recommend it very serious seller)	1
Hello, Gold Item bought from A-MONTAIN, delivered 2 days after the order (before the due date) in very good condition.After receipt and activation, I checked on the Apple website for the Manufacturer Warranty of 1 year and I have it which proves that the Iphone has never been used.Invoice requested from the seller and I am still waiting for a return on this subject. Works well after 15 days of use.	1
Product received in a very short time thanks to the Premium offer and delivery to an Amazon Locker deposit near my home. This is a new product at a great price. For now everything works perfectly. I will come back to update my comment if there is the slightest concern.But for the moment super happy with our purchase!	1
iPhone perfectly new, in its original packaging in official blister.Pareil that if you buy it in Apple Store, warranty activated the day of delivery (verified on the Apple website).	1
It's a real iPhone 7, the product is new, in blister, I have it for more than 7 months and I really have no problem with him, I have not tested the seal so I could not tell you if it works but against this winter it took a big snowball decu that melted on the phone but it has no problem so I think it works, great I produced, received with official charger, earphones official, official adapter, phone, stickers, anything, I recommend	1
Super used phone from a seller based in England. Some small signs of wear on the back of the device ..... I was frankly afraid to launch myself (without the "" premium "" plus!) ... and no regrets Super iOS 11 device (and not 10), super 128GB memory, great pictures, very good battery life for my use, very good signal ... I just added a protective glass (but this model is already more resistant) and a Otterbox Symmetry shell for use in the countryside, and everything	1
Purchased for a gift, the person is very happy, I was able to see the quality of the classic Retina display compared to the Android rivals around 550 € even if in theory the definition and the resolution are lower than these, it does not do not feel visually and yet I am someone very much on the quality of a screen! For example, I find it rivals the 2k screen of my old LG G3. The aluminum body is a real plus for a cautious person compared to the glass or the new steel Apple.Like many people I find more practical smartphones or tablets with a home button and digital identification rather than delete this central button and use facial recognition. The phone is compact, it will be suitable for people who appreciate it otherwise go to an IPhone 7 Plus model. The 128 MB of storage is necessary because iOS 12 already occupies about 21 GB so the 32 GB model leaves no room. The iOS version 12 system has made good progress so now you can do a lot more things than a few years ago, with my IPad Pro 2017 I can do almost anything compared to the first IPhone and IPad. Thanks to Amazon for the correct price with the 2 year warranty ensured the second year by Amazon since not purchased from a merchant partner. The seal has not been tested.	1
Apple product certified in Apple Store.The Amazon packaging is soft but it must remain discreet with this kind of product. Inside it is the original packaging of Apple with all the classic accessories, except that the back of the box is written in Cyrillic! Invoice claimed because not attached in the package and received by return of mail.Shipping in 3 days.One word: perfect because 150 € of saving	1
My little girl "" regularly "lost" her other phones: it was a subliminal language, an iPhone 7, otherwise nothing! Needless to say, she has never "lost". A lesson for his grandfather!	1
Received on time, in its original packaging with all its accessories. New phone under 1-year Apple warrantyMore satisfied with this product, I recommend it to all and will only pass through this company for my phonesThank you	1
Iphone arrived new in its original sealed packaging. User experience always nice, touch intuitive and reliable .. satisfactory autonomy despite what I had read. A product light years of Huawei that I use at work.	1
a small evolution by port to 6 we gain in speed and capacity as well as the camera more efficient	1
The product conforms to the description. The manual is in Russian, but as soon as you put the SIM card it displays the French language. I do not regret my purchase at all.	1
New product in usual blister Apple with all accessories but instructions in Cyrillic ... No problem to configure it to replace my 6 plus. New product at the price of the perfect refurb! And in addition received in less than 24 hours ... Excellent	1
The phone is great in itself. The photos are quality, and just do not ask too much for the battery you last a whole day or more (and even solicited, it holds). The interface is very convenient, as always. Fast and effective	1
thank you as indicated on the photoc''est genial !!!! I love you AMAZONje confirms the receipt of parcel in good condition	1
Super product as usual 'at Apple the quality has arrived several iPhone I expected no less than this iPhone 7 and the price is much more interesting than the Apple Store Amazon and very serious I recommend	1
Excellent value. Admittedly, the model is aging but it has the same material (soc and quantity of Ram) than ipad 2018. This means that it will be kept up to date as many years as this IPad (probably 3 or 4 years). Reactive and compact, it retains an old-fashioned look but typical of iPhones. Very good level in photo and video, and largely powerful enough to run any game.	1
Very good product complies with iPhones sold in the Apple Store. The phone is compatible with the mobile network and 4G France.	1
Very good price found in my Amazon of comfort. I use a PC and an iPad next so this size is enough for a mobile that serves me mainly phone, in the pocket is more convenient and blow for an iphone the price is quite affordable	1

Very good phone even in 2019. Fast and easy to use. The delivery was fast	1
I bought this phone from A-MOUNTAIN in August 2018. It arrived a few days after my order, nine, in blister as if I had bought in the shop! The control of the serial number on the Apple site indicates me a one-year warranty until August 2019. A few months later, no problem to report on this phone despite use more than intensive (used by a teenager !!!).	1
Phone conforms to my expectations. I was afraid to have a refurbished sold for nine but before it is a new phone because the Apple warranty is present.	1
Impeccable product, ditto at the output of an Apple Store, so why bother to move? In short, top to gift an iPhone not too much too expensive (everything is relative). It still remains a great phone, although, now that I've tasted the XR, I will not return to a "" small "" format.	1
Excellent phone product new warranty, buy from A-MONTAIN is shipped by Amazon the serious is the appointment fast delivery. I do not regret my purchase	1
Unfortunately this iPhone heated unusually plugged into the sector or the computer. So I sent it back. I'm going to order another .Sorry.	1

Fast delivery, against signature, well packaged.Product that must come from a country of the East. The serial number has been verified on the official website of Apple and it is indeed a real iPhone 7. You can order without worries, this is not a scam. A saving of 140 € all the sameBolem: no invoice delivered with the parcel, it is necessary to make the request.	1
Purchased from the seller A-MONTAIN, the smartphone is new, I also received the invoice by mail. On the whole it is a very good product sold € 100 less than the different operators. The laptop has a very good grip, menus under IOS are very intuitive and ergonomic, the notebook is fluid, photos and videos are good qualities. The size of the laptop is much smaller than most smartphones sold under Android. In short, I recommend.	1
Really excellent service! Received my iPhone in one day as expected. New as indicated, no problem. The insurance is even understood, I am delighted for a really interesting price!	1
I was very reluctant to buy an iPhone 7 Internet but the price was very interesting. So I tried and I was not disappointed. The delivery was fast and unhindered and it works perfectly.	1
iPhone 7 jet black buy at (A- MONTAIN). Five stars down the line, deliver before expected, the product is original, the real real In any case more than satisfied, I recommend. Without hesitation.	1
I hesitated for a long time to order. Given the price we are always afraid that there is a problem. But clearly nothing to complain about. Then I trust Amazon, if there is a problem the customer service is perfect so do not hesitate. Why pay more elsewhere?	1
An iPhone 7 a true, surely imported from a European country, but identical to the one you could buy in France for 150 € more.Number of series checked at Apple, phone recognized and guaranteed no problem ... Sacred offer !!!	1
perfectly matches the description of new warranty Apple 170 euro cheaper and it has a French power outlet I recommend very good product	1
being skeptical, I checked the IMEI, actually under Apple warranty, no trace of use, all signs of the new product (the real certainty being to go to an Apple store and asked the verif of such) so the iphone perfectly meets my expectations, and I earned about $ 150 ... I recommend.	1
I bought an iPhone 6 3 years ago, very satisfied with this new generation of big screen iPhone. Intensive user, my 6 was starting to show weaknesses of autonomy. And the move to iOS11 has created big slowdowns (grr) So here I am looking for a new iPhone. The 8 has a technical sheet not really higher than the 7, in my opinion. And the X left me of marble once taken in hand. So, I take advantage of the price drop on the iPhone 7. VERY satisfied with my purchase.	1
The IPhone arrived very well, despite a delay of 3 days, had to a sorting error.Everything is nickel, packaging, IPhone 7 and new accessories. Serious seller to recommend.	1
Apple still sells quality products, but this iPhone 7, released in 2016, is still functional in 2018. The latest updates do not slow down the iPhone 7 and it is still fluid at its release (if not is that it is still more functional than before). With the quality of the camera that is always at the rendezvous at Apple's smartphones, you will not be disappointed with your photos. -------------------------------GOOD POINTS----------------- ------------------- Quality photo / video- Speed- Simple iOS system --------------------- --------------NEGATIVE POINTS---------------------------------- - The battery that only holds a day like all iPhones.	1
DARK !!! It's now 1 month that I have it, and I wanted to wait before posting a comment, and to my surprise, phone Neuf, no bug, phone received in its original packaging, with the record in French. I took it in black Mate, beautiful !! If you have a doubt do not hesitate, buy it, it's a very good deal.	1
For those who still hesitate, do not hesitate and go for it, I was retires, I ordered the iphone 7 on Amazon for 615 € shipping included with the seller A-MONTAIN, very reliable seller that I recommend, delivery in 1 day, article nine and niquel. I checked the warranty on apple, and it is a year after the date of purchase! If you want to save more than 150 € you can do it without risk!	1
The package arrived a day earlier than expected, and I am delighted with my purchase. For those who have doubts, this is a new iPhone 7 and authentic. The package was well protected. In other words, at this price, it's well worth it	1
at the base I took a huawei p10 for the apn extremely disappointed by the quality I sold it for this iphone 7 and there is no regret not only the apn is very good but the product is much more convenient and well finished not to mention the apps much better optimized, my only regret and the lack of version 64 go it's all one or the other for me 32 it's not enough 128 it's too much	1
Very attractive price for an iPhone 7 128Go.Sold by Topprice 24 and RAS. Delivered in the evening by Amazon in the fixed niche. New Apple packaging, no trace on the phone. I checked the cover with Apple before (to find out if it is a new product) and after activation of the product. No problem, everything rolls.Other than that, well it's an iPhone 7 ... it changes my old 5S :)	1
When I read the description, with a cheap price because it is a used phone, I agreed to buy despite the defects announced: scratches on the device, article delivered without the box. However, when I received it, I had a pleasant surprise, the phone is in very good condition, has no scratches and is well delivered with the box. Thank you Apple Computer.	1
The last iPhone, beautiful, photo quality on top! Ultra fast fingerprint sensor. In short that positive and even autonomy is better than the previous iPhone!	1

No problem since the months I use it! My first Apple notebook, and he does admit this smartphone to a great stability! Especially when you're used to low-end laptops	1
Apple user since the 3GS I just spent 5 to 7 and especially 16 GB to 128Gol'appareil perfectly matches my expectations	1
quick delivery . despite the bad reviews that I could read, I can say that the product is new and blistered. I recommend	1
Loyal Samsung customer, I chose this iPhone for my wife, and I must say that it bluffed me. Already the design is successful, the tel is lightweight and a good grip. Siri is a real success compared to the google assistant. Only downside the non-expandable storage capacity as well as the lack of fast charger. In summary a very good quality smartphone.	1
For me it is the best phone of the moment I have to order one for my wife who really hang on the iphone 7	1
Iphone received in 24h thanks to Amazon Prime! The product is well packaged and in an Apple box. Supplied with charger, earphones and adapter. The manufacturer's warranty is activated when creating the iCloud account. In the top ! (And price much more interesting than on Apple) I totally recommend!	1
No worries, very fast delivery, portable blister with warranty (verified on Apple) .Box and record in Russian that make a great savings on this phone.Invoice by mail after request to the seller.	1
The iphone 7 is perfectAt early I was afraid that it is defective because of its price but I was surprised when I received it I really recommend it! 5/5	1
Telephone that perfectly matches the description, no scratches, no defects at the moment. I am 100% satisfied with it!	1
Super I'm really satisfied I recommend this seller A-Montain I was afraid that there is a problem at this price but not at all	1
I am someone very honest. This iPhone 7 is great I honestly recommend it works great, no problem with it is at the top	1
Nothing to say about the product itself is an iphone 7By very very disappointed against the packaging, delivery time and I found my package in my mailbox for a product at this price I find it very disappointing and very irresponsible	1
Conforming product, delivery ok.	1
Frankly considering the title import I was afraid, whether it was a scam or anything, or that we do not operate in France, I said I test anyway at worst I will return. And to my surprise, everything is perfect !!!! Parcel arrives very quickly (two days after purchase) niquel packaging box seal and certify Apple. As soon as I put my sims in the iPhone 7 which I specify and new and not reconditioned, the iPhone ask me the French default, I click yes and everything is done! In short all I have to say is that the phone is cheaper than the French market much cheaper, the delivery was perfect, the iPhone niquel new and downright functional 100pourcent! In short I advise those who are afraid to start like me to go blindfold! Because it was perfect !!! Thank you !!! (Only downside the manual is in German for me, but we do not care a bit of the instructions!) And also strong point the iPhone is guaranteed 1 year Apple plus 1 year store, bill in support that my summer sent by mail! Thanks again !!	1
The product arrived in perfect condition In addition to that I had a Samsung before and I absolutely do not regret being passed at Apple the quality of is just perfect I like	1
Bought for my wife. As there is an apple on it is very satisfied. I bought for myself a phone that was twice as cheap a short time ago, and whose characteristics seem to me almost identical. But it's not an iphone.	1
Unsurprisingly, high-flying product. Quality at the rendezvous, the black color is the most beautiful effect. Spiegen's skin hull protection allows it to enhance itself in making space congestion. Fast delivery within 2 days after order. Impeccable transaction !!! I recommend.	1
New phone, sealed packaging and activation of the guarantee via Apple without problem. The phone surely comes from a country at the favorable exchange rate, but insofar as it will have cost € 161 less than store for the same conditions. ..One without fault.	1
Fast, powerful, ergonomic, shiny, pretty, solid, and waterproof (I have not tried and be careful because in case of damage related to a liquid you are not covered by the Apple warranty, yes it's paradoxical) It's a jewelery.	1
My daughter does not leave her anymore she is every day with it is very functional it is very convenient	1
Purchased from the seller Topprice 24 you can go safe! Certainly the manual is in Russian, but no matter because when you put your Nano Sim in the iPhone 7 it is immediately in French:) As soon as I I received (in 2 days with Premium) I immediately checked the serial number on the Apple site and they said that this iPhone had not been activated yet and I could not know the warranty date: excellent news that confirms a totally new product and not reconditioned as some want to believe.I therefore activated my iPhone 7 and rechecked on the site and I had confirmation of the Apple warranty with the option to subscribe the Apple Care + within 3 months.I then sent an invoice request message (dedicated button in the order history) and in less than 24 hours I had my invoice in the message manager.I therefore have 2 years of European guarantee (since it is an important t Europe) as if I had bought it in any shop in France or elsewhere in Europe;)	1
I am very satisfied with the Apple 7, especially since I associated its acquisition with the protective case shown below, which is remarkable.	1
I fell for the 7 important differences with my 5C that I do not regret at allThanks Amazon	1
Good product corresponding to the description. with the accessories that it is also necessary. Nothing to complain about. The move from android to iphone was a success	1
Some say that the iPhone 7 is a sequel, but nothing to do with the 6 S more stable and much more powerful (stereo, and image stabilizer) and A 10 chip much more powerful.	1
Sold by A-Montain, this iphone arrived in 24h. It was totally new, under wrapping never opened. After verification, the Apple warranty started well the day I bought the phone. Very serious seller and material of excellent quality! However, it must be admitted that the novelties are really very minimal .. Apart from the stereo sound and tightness, no change.	1
Received yesterday, 1 day before the scheduled date. The iPhone works perfectly! Nothing to say here, except that it is the cheapest on the market for a new purchase.	1
For somebody who made the transition from an iPhone 5s, it was a very nice experience obviously. So concerning the seller there is no complaint. It was new in its packaging with the correct accessories. When I bought, it was shipped by Amazon so the delivery was correct and the guarantee and confidence in Amazon.Always difficult to adjust without the plug 3.5mm but it is for me that uses my pro helmets very often (now with the small connector)	1
Ordered at RH mobile, the iPhone took less than a week to arrive! It was delivered against signature, well packaged. It came in a different color from the one I ordered, but I decided to keep it anyway and RH Mobile did not mind when I asked for a small commercial gesture, they are also very responsive to I recommend 100%	1
It is great I love I can not do without the iPhone, other brands I can more.Il is large and light is good when it is in the bag is not heavy perfect	1
Nothing to complain about, after 2 or 3 years of intensive use, always functional (obviously the battery holds maxi the day using current ...)	1
Hello, I'm totally satisfied it's been a month since I bought it but today it does not work it is more relight is with my warranty can be repaired or give me a new one. Thank you	1
Hello, my return after having tested it 1 week model 128 GoLors of his keynote, Apple has as usual promised that his last born was "" the best iPhone "" ever created. Performance side, the iPhone 7 is equipped with a chip A10 Fusion quadricoeur, presented as 40% faster than the A9 that fitted the iPhone 6S. The battery has also been improved: the smartphone would be two hours longer than its predecessor (only one more hour for the Plus version). The iPhone 7 is equipped with stereo speakers and a Retina HD screen with 3D Touch, 25% brighter than the previous one. The home button is no longer physical as before, haptic feedback technology - already present on the trackpad of Macs - is used to give the impression of the click. It is also customizable with three different pressure levels. The most important announcement surely concerns the camera. The front camera goes to 12 megapixels (with aperture at 1.8) and the back to 7 megapixels (aperture 2.2). The flash now consists of four LEDs for better color rendering. But above all, the iPhone 7 Plus is equipped with a dual sensor, two lenses at 12 megapixels each. One is a wide angle, the other is a telephoto lens that provides an x2 optical zoom. Apple promises that its new camera can make more clear, brighter shots and especially to create a bokeh effect with the new portrait mode. Latest evolution and not least, the disappearance of the jack. Apple has made the decision not to equip its iPhone 7 mythical connector. Any audio device must be connected via the Lightning port (which also serves to charge the iPhone) or Bluetooth. So that the change does not feel too much, the iPhone 7 comes with an adapter and EarPods Lightening earphones. Apple also unveiled at the September keynote new AirPods wireless headphones that can be purchased separately for 179 euros. Design side, the iPhone 7 is not very different from its predecessor. As expected, the antenna lines have disappeared. But above all, two new colors are emerging: black and jet black (shiny). This last color is reserved for versions 128 and 256 Go.But remains a little expensive anyway, but I recommend it with pleasureConnial Philippe Amari	1
Arrive quickly, against small bug at the screen that touches everywhere at times ........	1
Super iPhone 7 received in its original packaging with headphones and charger I highly recommend this iPhone	1
So I put the note of 5/5 to this iPhone 7, I admit that I was really charmed by this smartphone of the Apple brand..certes not revolutionary but modernized and always more optimized and powerful.In this case , this iPhone 7 is beautiful at first from a visual point of view, well packaged, the device can be discovered in several new colors, note the matte black and the jet black (shiny black), these two colors are beautiful, personally I have a soft spot for matte black.The grip, and the configuration are both very easy and intuitive. Having had the opportunity to own as many iOs (Apple) as Androids, my preference is always Apple, certainly this opinion is personal and I totally believe that others prefer the Android system.The screen is very beautiful ..retina is for something.New for this iPhone 7, the 3D Touch, and the central button "" Home "" touch, these two innovations are at first glance gadgets but they are very quickly essential. Then comes the big change! The pure disappearance of the port Jack in favor of a single port lighting for both the charging of the device and listening to music. Between us, this change can be a little confusing at first, it does not really change much in the overall usage experience. Finally Apple is (as always?) A pioneer of "" risky "" innovations; the jack is already threatened with extinction for a moment.To conclude, a much more powerful camera, always attractive, interesting and pioneering innovations .. A price certainly high, but with regard to the aura of the brand. I recommend this smartphone without hesitation, reminding all the same that 2017 will see the birth of one or more new iPhone in September (should we wait?)!	1
iphone 7 is really an incredible phone, it's the best of all smartphones, I recommend it to anyone who wants a simple but effective phone	1
Bought the day of its release I'm not disappointed! Firstly the design is not very innovative it remains faithful to the brand, but the quality of finish and the materials used are very good quality.Coté performance as his usual the iPhone has no slowdown especially since it is equipped with the latest processor from Apple.The camera is also excellent photo rendering day and low light is very good. The front camera allows selfies in all circumstances. The battery is still a big strong point I keep an average of a day and a half which is rather very correct. The screen is BEAUTIFUL colors and contrast are bluffing, nothing To say more jack for the earphone but an adapter is provided with the iphone.Le key ID is always excellent it is very responsive and never bug.En conclusion: As always at Apple, quality products and very performance. Only downside the price is far too high compared to the competition.	1
I was super suspicious about the authenticity of the iphone. I received the product very quickly and immediately began checking against the little anti Fake guide on Youtube, everything is consistent. Call directly to Apple to verify the IMEI number, also conform and they confirmed that was a good product with warranty. Total satisfaction, thank you to Topprice24 for the invoice sent by email. The iphone is good CE, but must come from another country (text on the back of the package in another language) Anyway, I'm not disappointed by the iphone, everything works, optimized product, many applications, compatibility with my server Synology, I leave without regret my Lumia which I had almost thrown to the ground several times so Microsoft optimizes well its phones.Certes it is not the same price, but my time is too precious and I have enough lost with my Lumia.Complément following the imminent release of the iPhone 8, Apple put a link for proposed a buyout of your old iPhone to buy the 8. I made the approach with my number and there Apple announces me that this phone with a residual value of 0 € ???? While on the phone Apple had confirmed the authenticity of the product. In doubt, I maintain the 5 star rating, but it's still weird.	1
I just received it today and I am totally satisfied! It replaces my old iphone 6s which has had its day and not wanting to put a fortune for the last iphone I sliced ​​for 7. No need to make a spitch on the quality apple, it's all good	1
Have an iPhone 7 in such a short time with a nice promo, in his beautiful box in blister etc.	1
This iPhone 7 is not too expensive compared to the latest.I have ordered for my wife because his old 4S broke on the back because of a third battery that has inflated ... As it does not is not a big consumer of memory, the 32GB model suits him well (she was only 16 GB on his 4S). The black model bought is extremely discreet. Everything is black, even the apple on the back of the phone! For the rest, it's Apple quality.	1
Nothing to say, this iphone is excellent big evolution compared to the previous generation being an owner of an SE the difference is not negligible, the applications are much faster and more immersive with the 3d touch (I was not convinced at first). Delivery in two days thank you AMAZON and for the price A-MONTAIN is super well placed! I can only recommended to apple addict!	1
I bought this iPhone especially thanks to the price, I had a lot of fear on "" A-Mountain "" but the previous comments made me change my mind, I received my iPhone 7 today! It is new, under Apple warranty, compatible with the French network, unlocked and especially new! I really advise (I received it the day after the order posted but I live in a small village in the mountains so nothing weird) PS: sorry for the mistakes ...	1
Arriving in good times! The card change with my operator no problem! I am very satisfied with my purchase ! I recommend for the price and the phone!	1
Hello, This is the first time I order an iPhone 7 at A-Montain, (especially on the internet) I had questions about the product, ultra fast response in the day.Two products ordered (2 x iPhone7 128GB), received in Chronopost the next day, good packaging.Iphone7, new, in its original packaging, with all accessories Apple.Very good seller, I recommend it!	1
Authentic device and new despite the various comments and elements indicating that it was reconditioned, and that can make doubt. the iPhone has arrived in its box, blistered with all its accessories in their original storage system. A quality / price ratio that is unbeatable at reception.	1
I bought this phone a little over a year ago and I am very satisfied! It is a very good phone in several points (except at the level of autonomy). However, if you had to buy it in 2018, I advise you to turn rather to the last (Iphone 8 or IPhone X), or even wait until September 2018 to have new models that will look like the Iphone X with a price more affordable.	1
J hesitated to order on the internet but I'm not disappointed! Very fast delivery and superb iPhone! The user manual is not in French (d or price in my opinion because import) but for seasoned users, no problem just put it nano sim and select the french and presto!	1
I was super suspicious about the authenticity of the iphone. I received the product very quickly and immediately began checking against the little anti Fake guide on Youtube, everything is consistent. Call directly to Apple to verify the IMEI number, also conform and they confirmed that had a good product with warranty. Total satisfaction	1
Purchased this summer (about 3 months), RAS all ok except that we can not cut / lower the sound when we take a picture ... direct model of China ... This function is blocked for the sale coming from this country.Very painful anyway ...	1
To date, the most successful iphones for me (with the SE). Aesthetically very successful, fluid, great pictures, good size. Not an autonomy of phew but I want more than a day in moderate use.	1
I had a doubt about the veracity of the product but no it's a real new iphone with the adapter tip for the headphones so no fears after a few times of use RAS	1
Reception on time. IPhone in a well closed box. Easy to use, we find the same characteristics as on an older iPhone. No worries so far!	1
It's an iPhone, what else to say? Not being influenced by the need to have the latest fad (at a high price), and not wishing a mega big smartphone, the 7 is largely powerful enough, and the price has become more affordable.	1
Superb alternative to buying in stores at a disproportionate price. The iPhone 7 comes from Czech but personally I do not care because it's exactly the same as everywhere else. It's really nice to be able to benefit from a nice reduction even if it can be a problem with the guarantee in case of problems but the Apple products are of exceptional quality, I fear nothing. It's been two months now and the iPhone works wonders.	1
Arrived very quickly. New product, consistent and 1 year warranty Apple! I highly recommend.	1
As always at Apple, we are never disappointed. I made the jump from iPhone 5 to 7, it really feels like having another device in your hands. impeccable	1
conforme a la description. IPhone Original.	1
New and packaged phone.Content of the purchase.	1
Received a new iPhone as expected thank you	1
I feared a scam but it is a real iPhone, cheaper because imported from Russia. Nothing to say, it's perfect.	1
Great product, nothing to say I am delighted with my new property, very fast, very beautiful, solid, remarkable camera. I recommend.	1
Sending very neat and fast by the supplier. The iphone7 has more 32GB capacity. Quick start especially when we had an iphone6. It is missing a record	1
Works perfectly. One downside, I did not get the proper Jack that should have been in the box. I had to buy one.	1
Corresponds perfectly to Gain description in response very high compared to 5Great memory capacity for apps	1
New product and quality shipment	1
The phone was new, never used. Perfect.	1
Nothing to say for the moment.	1
For those who know and love the iPhone, no complaints! Product complies with the commercial description that Apple.	1
Initially I hesitated and since I do not stop using it is my best buy of the year. Very happy with my purchase!	1
Less expensive than elsewhere for the new arrived in blister and carefree :) I strongly recommend to have a new Iphone without too much ruin	1
Apple's RAA what!	1
New iPhone received quicklyComplete with the description	1
Personal use	1
My order placed with A-MONTAIN went very well: very attractive price, very fast delivery. The product is new and original and has the Apple warranty after activation.Parfait - thank you	1
An Iphone 7 128GB NEUF for 729 euros, while the official shop price is 879 euros? Yes it is possible! I chose the model sold by Topprice 24 and shipped by Amazon to be serene.The laptop arrived in 48h in its official packaging sealed Apple. The only difference with the model sold in the Apple Store in France = the country of origin. It seems that this one comes from Greece, but not important since the Iphone is multilingual and you can choose French at startup.The phone is at the top, I had an Iphone SE before. This is not the revolution, but a good little upgrade in terms of performance and (in my case) in terms of the size of the screen.Bref, no interest in moving into an apple store to pay the product full pot when one can benefit from this type of deals.	1
always as well, as usual at Apple, more perfectly waterproof (he has already made a turn in the sink lol), otherwise very good seller at A-MONTAIN no problem more delivered by Amazon premium.	1
A new iphone 7 and nothing wrong the doc is not in English or French but no importance it is switched on and we choose the language so for a price well below the price Apple is great	1
I have an android for a few years, I could never resolve to put the price of an iPhone. Finally I got tired, it's like Windows finally: we can tinker as we want but the disadvantage is that it is not as pleasant and intuitive to use because the hardware and software integration is necessarily less good.Apple is more locked but what comfort in everyday life. No regrets. Ergonomics is nickel. A beautiful object with beautiful performances.	1
Purchased with A-Montain shipped by amazon so no problem. Apparently the iphone does not come from France but there is the outlet for France (some may be bought an apple product with a US plug or other, pay attention). Anyway the most important is that it is new with the Apple warranty so I recommend	1
Bought because my 5S had just let me go I'm glad I could find this seller on amazon offering this phone at a very good price. At first sight it seems to me that this phone comes from a country in the east (written on the instructions for use). New, it comes in its plastic film.	1
Received a week ago. New phone, immaculate condition. Works perfectlyAbsolutely nothing to say. Why pay more?	1
New iPhoneOrder and delivery by Mountain because there are more than 2000 orders and positive reviewsAnd nothing to say new product and genuine ApplePackaging origins with accessoriesBref the same as Apple store but 200 € less !! I got it at 540 € No problem settingsI found all my configuration with my account iCloudJe advise you an ice and protective shell for my part I took spigen because it is a recognized brand and adapted perfectly to the iPhone for less than 15 € more	1
Super Iphone 7 (import version), received brand new (packaged)! On ignition, just select the language, and c part!	1
The seller was topprice24, the iPhone was shipped to Amazon very quickly Then Amazon sent it directly to the carrier Private Package It took 4 days to Private Package to take care of the package and then it was delivered quicklyThere are tons of negative comments on private package but I do not understand why, monitoring on the internet is effective, and after a first attempt at delivery, I chose a withdrawal relay point, everything was nickelOn the iPhone itself, it's exactly the same as buying it in stores, except that the indications of the beginning (cards with description of the buttons etc) are in a foreign language but it does not bother you just turn on the phone and be guided, but above all it is 180 € cheaper here, so I think it's worth it to wait 10 days! I'm absolutely satisfied with my new phone, just that I did not think it would be so big and heavy	1
Like all previous comments, I was skeptical of an IPhone 7 blister identical to an Apple Store. I started reading the comments. So it's my turn to write that I'm perfectly satisfied. (Save $ 189 compared to Apple), it is not neutral. I recommend this solution if you want a phone identical to Apple at a lower price!	1
I bought my IPhone 7 (128go) black at Topprice 24. The iPhone is brand new, it is not a refurbished new. Original sealed packaging etc ... The package arrived quickly, the iPhone is beautiful. After request, I received my invoice by email. I enjoy the Apple warranty which is 1 year. Apple care is possible. I'm finally quiet side storage (128GB) for a new iPhone that cost me much less than a 32 GB ... I recommend Topprice 24!	1
Complies with the description. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Well protected, delivered before the deadline. Always so happy with the apple brand. I recommend it to you.	1
I ordered this iPhone 7 for my girlfriend, and I'm really satisfied, I received it before the estimated delivery dates and it works perfectly, there is just the box and the manual that are not in language French but the phone is good, just enough the meter in French and it's gone, there is like even a good price difference with those in stores so I recommend. What more for this order	1
Ordered yesterday, had this morning. Top! New product in a box as if you buy it in an apple store, there is an i phone 7, a charger, a cable to charge the phone, earphone and a small cable that allows us to connect the headphones. I own the article since qlqs hours but for now I am delighted. (Article that costs anyway 100euros less than in the other shops)	1
For those who still hesitate to take the plunge. The phones are sold new mine arrived very quickly no bad surprise original Apple packaging with a russian record (EU import) the box was complete with all the accessories.	1
Nothing to say, Apple always on top for me and Iphone 7 is a great success.And with this color "" Black "", I am filled	1
Perfect for me, it holds the load well and I was able to enlarge the icons without the screen is too big and can not fit in my pocket or my bag. Moreover the delivery very fast and against signature is very good	1
Received this morning, order within 1 business day. Super tracking, article nine, easy getting started. Everything is working. I plan to redo a comment after a few weeks of use.I highly recommend this seller.	1
I go from a 4s to a 7 and I feel the difference. Super fast fluid phone. The delivery was fast. I am very satisfied with this phone.	1
iPhone 7 arrived new with original packaging! Everything works perfectly, I am delighted with my purchase at this price!	1
Delivered in less than 24 hours, iPhone 7 silver 128 GB new, 1 year warranty Apple.With Apple we know what we buy, I am satisfied.	1
The phone is a product apple, I asked the question that it is cheaper than Apple store but once the phone received I was reassured, it is not a counterfeit. Phone received in 24h, amazon at the top	1
That satisfaction of having an Iphone 7 in the hands, I really recommend the Iphone for their OS which are really more pleasant to use	1
Received my iPhone quickly, packaging a bit light for my taste. I had concerns about the site because the product came from the EU but finally my doubts flew away. Very nice iPhone 7 at a very good price compared to an Apple store. For the moment I am delighted with my purchase on the site topprice 24, just a flat for the bill for the guarantee that the seller must send me at my request. So no 5 stars because of the otherwise perfect packaging! 2 days after receiving the iPhone I receive the invoice of the seller so I add the 5th star! And I want to say that I marvel each day of this gem of technology that is this iPhone I am now convinced to have made the right choice, great !!!!	1

Fast delivery, the same evening (A-Montain seller). Just send an invoice request to get it. The record is not in French (Russian) but honestly, I did not need it having already had iphones, and if it allows to pay 150 € cheaper than in France for a new product, it's worth it! I offered it to my husband who had an iphone 5 so he was happy and indeed, the change was necessary, but me who has a 6S I do not find huge evolutions. So to advise those who have a version lower than the 5S.	1
The iPhone 7 was released last September and you must know that it does not have a headphone jack and that its design is almost identical to that of the iPhone 6 (2014) and 6s (2015). But despite this apparent lack of renewal, the 7 is indeed better iPhone to date. There are real reasons to choose an iPhone 7, including for those who have a recent iPhone: -Iphone 7 is now waterproof; -The camera is much more powerful, especially in low light and it enjoys the Optical Image Stabilization; - Autonomy is a little better; - The processor is definitely faster. Add to this list, a screen that makes even more colors, stereo speakers, a home button that no longer "clicks" but instead uses pressure sensitive 3D Touch technology. A new home button a little confusing at the beginning elsewhere.So now, if you want to connect a headset or wired headphones, you must go through the adapter provided or opt for Bluetooth wireless models. Or you can use wired headphones with Lightning plug that are delivered originally. The iPhone 7 may be an excellent smartphone rich in novelties, the headphone I miss it.Although its design is always attractive, thin and ergonomic, it looks like to be mistaken for that of an iPhone 6 or 6s. The main aesthetic novelty is the arrival of the new jet black and matte black color that adds to the silver, pink and gold hue. Jet black is sensitive to scratches and fingerprints. That's why I preferred his version Blanche for my wife.The new quad core processor A10 Fusion that equips the iPhone 7 combines performance and energy savings through a mode that optimizes consumption with only two cores solicited. The results are immediately visible through several sessions on GeekBench. The iPhone 7 is really fast, much more than any other iOS device including the iPad Pro. It is also faster than the latest Samsung models and the Google Pixel. This iPhone is a monster of performance.More: The camera and the front camera more powerful with optical image stabilization offer much better photos, especially in low light. Tightness, fast processor, slightly higher battery life, more storage for the same price as last year's modelThe least: no headphone jack (an adapter is provided), the home button without click mechanical which requires a time of adaptation. The jet black version is prone to scratchesI recommend this product without any problem and if you have any questions, I will be happy to answer.If you find this comment useful or at least distracting, please click "" Useful	1
Purchase arrived very quickly from a third party seller than Amazon. Although this one does not have a French origin, it does not matter. However, it must be noted that there is marked on the back of the box that the product is compatible with all EU countries. For the phone, I switch from Android to this phone and the change is for me I think irreversible. More fluid, less bug, very responsive phone. I advise	1
I received my Iphone in very good condition without problems. They work perfectly well. I am totally satisfied with my order!	1
I am very satisfied with this iPhone! After hesitating for a long time because the price is still quite important the product arrived a week in advance. The product is certified Apple, new and original. I highly recommend because there is still a difference of 150 € compared to the price of the Apple Store.	1
Very happy with my purchase. This phone holds the battery much better than other iphone. I find it very good.	1
Hello, I have the iPhone 7 since its release and I will give you my opinion after 10 months of use.- Ergonomics & design: You know what? The iPhone 7 is an iPhone 6S which itself was an iPhone 6, the design has not changed, except the disappearance of the jack and the camera that flattened but widens. There are also antennas that have been relocated to the upper and lower edges of the iPhone. Three new colors are available in addition: matte black, jet black and red at the time of writing this text, when I bought, only the two blacks were available. Despite the little change, the iPhone is very pleasant in hand, it holds very well, exemplary finish, we can just regret the edges of the screen when we see the Galaxy S8 next ... The new button Touch ID is no longer really one, it becomes touch and touch it vibrates, we can adjust the vibrator on three levels and we quickly taste! When I take a 6S or a 6 in hand the button becomes almost annoying! - The screen: The screen is excellent quality really nothing wrong (1334x750px), the colors are very faithful, the brightness in daylight is excellent.- Autonomy: Well, I have had almost all iPhones, I can tell you that the autonomy is better than the 6S we feel that we can hold the day on a semi intensive, it's to say just social networks, messages, a few calls ... if you play a lot, watch YouTube videos etc, it gets a little more fair, in the evening the phone will start to be hungry ... But it's still respectable .- Photo: Sincerely, the photos of the iPhone are excellent, at night it has improved significantly, days is excellent, a very good dive, the photos look natural, small filters are available to make some effects it's really excellent. But I find that next to the 6 and 6S there is no big difference and it is a pity.Hostily this year Apple has added an optical stabilization module and I you that in videos it is indispensable once it tastes.- Use: IOS, it is what makes that I take the iPhone rather than Android, IOS is super pretty, super purified, very easy to use, even the youngest find themselves there easily on it. The OS is very smooth, no slowdown, very very little application crash, the network is very good if you have a good operator. The games do not lag at all, we feel that the phone is powerful. The sound of the speakers is much more powerful than the iPhone 6S.- Conclusion: A consistent iPhone, it is what the iPhone 6S should have been, excellent for a phone everyday as a professional phone, L 'OS is absolutely nice used and very fluid, the camera is also excellent.Après 10 months of use I am always satisfied with my phone, the battery is still the road no complaints.Is it to buy? Clearly we are in July, the next iPhone out in September as much as waiting for the next fate to decide at worst if the new you are not interested in the 7 will have fallen in price.Other question between Android and iOS is mainly depending on the profile of the user, if you are more social networks, you are equipped with Apple (iPad, MBP, etc.) I will say iOS if you want a large screen without edge (S8: D) instead go to Android.I hope that my opinion will have served you add photos from my phone.PS: I forgot !!! It is certified IP67 is to say that it goes to 1m deep for 30 minutes, I even tried and it works I jumped into the pool and took pictures with it and it works perfectly! I do not advise you to do it but for testing it resists well!	1
We have offered this iPhone 7 to our son for his 19 years, he is delighted does not let go me more selling the fluidity of the screen, the very high quality of photos and videos. He is totally excited. He recommends it without any reservation.	1
Very nice product. The phone is new, NOT RECONDITIONED! It comes with all these accessories and conforms to the description on the site.	1
Very good smartphone at the same time we had to suspect the apple. This device complies with the description.	1
So already let's be clear, the autonomy is excellent since now 1 year of intensive use, superb photo quality, the touch ID responds perfectly, Corresponds to my expectations. I recommend it.	1
Rendering the super screen one of the best in the market, the autonomy is in clear progress. The disappearance of the mini-jack requires a bluetooth device so can be a further pity that it does not provide wireless headphones at this price.	1
No hesitation, it's a real IPhone from Apple that works very well. Everything is ok for me, I received it in its Apple packaging	1
I am expensive apple since the iphone 4 and I am more and more pleased with the innovation that offers apple.Super very intuitive phone and the quality of the videos and just superb as well as the photos its just beautiful .I am using it a lot of my phone for my vlog for my youtube channel and its a real pleasure! I recommend it a great phone the battery holds pretty good and great pictures.	1
Bought at Free ... super portable. Nothing to say. Durable battery and wonderful picturesIn addition it is waterproofWrought by my iPhone 7	1

The product has arrived in its original box and with accessories in a very short time. Nothing to complain about the features of this phone. After more than 3 weeks of use nothing wrong. For the price, it's still an Apple, so a little expensive ... But it's my choice :)	1

RAS - NICKEL PRODUCT - AS NEW	1
First Apple phone, we get used to (very) quickly, the ergonomics are well thought out (and when we already have an iPad too, it helps ...)! I bought this phone from the seller A-Montain ( shipped by Amazon, we're not crazy either;)!) and no worries! Well French box, original outlet, etc ... Just a few hundred euros to save. You can go there with your eyes closed. Received the day after my order, as expected! In short, only positive.	1
Package shipped rather quickly (ordered on Monday, delivered the following Friday) Regarding the content, the device is perfectly new, delivered in its original box under plastic. The only "downside" the offer stipulated was a matte black iPhone 7 Plus, but I got a jet black iPhone 7 Plus, but that's just one detail.	1
I am very happy with this article very reliable easy to use a very good reception at the sound	1
I loveNo comments, a lot of new features. Convenient for an independent contractor.The screen protection a bit difficult to put.	1
Delivery scheduled for Monday of next week and I received it Friday of this week so pleasantly surprised, the iphone does not press any scratch really nickel. The battery nothing to say really tt is at the top. It comes in a generic box, unfortunately there is no earpod, replaced by bluetooth headphones (too big, I do not like) and like more jack, the purchase of earpods or air pods becomes essential .Concerning the cable and adapter, they are not originals too so I advise you to buy to preserve the autonomy of your battery. Apart from these points, I am very satisfied with this iPhone that looks really new.	1
New phone without any scratches in its original packaging, I would have bought in an Apple store it would have been the same but more than 100 € more expensive ...	1
Phone on top, very ergonomic and works very well I am delighted with my purchase and I recommend it. It is simply stunning in terms of its stunning photo quality or its autonomy and design.	1
Apple is Apple I'm a fan every year I take the last beast! Never disappointed always at the top it's true that I leave money but for me it's more than a phone is also an accessory Stylish brief frankly never goal and can that there was this rule very very quickly! I recommend this product good grip quick beautiful photo !!!!!!!!! To you who reads this comment takes the Frankly you will not regret it received super fast!	1
I am used to Apple products with several iPhone and Macbook. This year I take the new beer as usual. The camera is just amazing. The grip is simple.design is very purify and perfect finishes. This is an expensive phone but for my personal use it is perfect. I advise you anyway the 7 because the 7 plus is large and much more expensive.ca serves There is nothing to take this phone if you just want to go on google. This phone is really great.	1
A great product, it takes a little time to get used to the size of the screen but after a few days it's just happiness!	1
SUPER AS TELEPHONE NOT TOO MUCH CHANGE IN RELATION TO THE IPHONE 6S PLUS BUT IT IS BETTER I REALLY ADVISE YOU TO BUY IT	1
Question. Hello I have a friend who has an iPhone 7 Plus and I would like to have one and I feel that yours is great, so I have a YouTube channel with a lot of subscribers (250 000 subscribers ) I will be able to advertise you so that you have more customers. If you want me to advertise, send me the product and I will advertise you.	1
Product: exactly the same as those found in the Apple Store, new product, nothing to report.Delivery: 2 days delay for delivery, but other than that, nothing to report.	1
IPhone excellent quality nice screen are excellent to recommend	1
Receipt sealed. Super smartphone to replace a Samsung S7. Impeccable.	1
Perfect state frankly !! With 2 gift protection film and silicone shell like new, iPhone opportunity like new bravo nothing to say	1
Frankly I had the Samsung s7 edge (android) and I was fed up ... so I went to the competition (ios) and frankly there is no picture this iPhone 7 + is simply awesome !!!!! !! certainly the price is there but once it is it's pure happiness :) Live photos, image quality, grip and there is even an adapter to plug a jack and it c 'is great :)	1
This iPhone is cheaper than the competition for a reason: it's an iPhone that comes from the countries of the east (the iPhone must be cheaper in these countries). The box is not French and the instructions either, but ultimately the iPhone is exactly the same as the one you could buy in France. So good for almost 200 euros difference is not serious.The iPhone is good NEW and not reconditioned. In short if everything works nickel, a beautiful beast. FYI I received the model A1784.Voila I specify for those who would wonder why the price is lower.	1
Super	1
I stopped my mobile free subscription with such rental. It was a 6S. For some time I had only cuts and no network every we and rarely. So I changed the operation and bought the same on Amazon.I am very happy with this model 6S. It is simple and sufficient. The delivered is obviously new, it is not a copy.Il is obviously already sim-unlocked. I was able to use it with the free sim at the end of subscription and live with the new sim then. Delivered in 2 days	1
Except the price	1
Very good product that works better than some might believe in 2018. Ordered and shipped the same day (February 27) and received this morning. New and very well packaged (in the original box with accessories) it keeps its promises. Purchased with the "sender" F-mobile and transported by DPD.	1

Good version of iPhone nothing to say	1
Excellent product. Super fast delivery, nothing to repeat that happiness.auau for the price much too expensive but that's because of the policy 'Apple	1
All right, I ordered this iphone for my 85-year-old mother who never had a mobile phone, the SIRI application installed on it delighted her and greatly facilitates the use of the phone. I recommand it.	1
Telephone new and corresponding to the order; no bad surprise so	1
The device is new, covered by the Apple warranty and works perfectly. The model (6s) is very pleasant to use and still far from obsolete!	1
I have this iPhone for about 6 months and I have nothing to say. It works well, no bug, very sufficient storage capacity. Do not slow down after installing multiple games. When used properly, the battery keeps me a day.	1
Bought for my eldest daughter: happy proud and therefore more careful with her	1
The quality iPhone is more to prove. Perfect for my dad, who does not need the latest style.	1
The transition from LG G3 to iPhone seems to be conclusive! Best photo quality, faster, more beautiful ... I still have a lot to discover	1
Already owner of Apple products, this phone meets our expectations. Beautiful, powerful enough and very easy to use. Even if price a bit high. Very satisfied.	1

Well received and very quickly from Germany. Surprise the phone is absolutely new (yet bought as a recycled) headphones, cables and original charger with their respective plastic. I do not regret this purchase from this seller. Small flat all in German, even the bill and a notice of warnings but I did as with other previous i phone and it works perfectly, I had the battery check it is new!	1
Received an iPhone 6S plus 64 new (large model) never activated instead of a reconditioned 6S 64gb (small model), I called customer service to inform them of the error, positive for me, the answer is keep it or keep it..i have it kept, no thanks gentlemen to report us this concern but we say honesty does not pay ....	1
hello I allow you to write to know if the iphone and well nine it's just to know before you bought thank you cordially	1
After a few years under Android and big battery problems with a Huawei 6p (Nexus), back to the iPhone. Getting started as easy. good product, good battery performance	1
No problem with this model, acquired 6 months ago	1
Brand new phone very well I know this brand well I recommend	1
A little gem that made me take a more serious mobile plan. All is well still need to have hands very clean and dry to use the fingerprint recognition	1
Light, practical and fast	1
product perfectly in line with the application (iphone 6S 128GB silver) and completc is a model for France compatible free 4G for example.	1
Simple phone even when you do not know the Apple system.The screen is very responsive and with a great visual rendition.Perfect delivery well protected.	1
Very beautiful object. Excellent value. I used to have the iPhone 4s and I'm not homesick. The quality has been greatly improved.	1
Coming from the android world, more exactly from Samsung, it will have taken some time for the adaptation, and it's not over. But Sincerely, why did not I go before? Finally a smartphone that works all the time, and in any case whenever I need it. Because, I had cracked for the last Samsung, which is all the same price as the Apple, no change possible battery ... well a phone almost similar, but that I will have to replace by 2 times for cause of wrong way ... Really, there is more to hesitate ...	1
Super	1
Ordered Sunday, received on Wednesday, nothing to say for the delivery, the package was maybe a little light for what there is inside but good. The phone is in excellent condition totally new with all the original accessories, works very well and is of great image quality, it is a pleasure I recommend without worries. Do not hesitate to tell me if this comment was useful for you or not.	1

Impeccable, I recommend	1
Very well	1
Perfect	1
Ok it's big, but what comfort! It's no longer a phone, it's a computer in the pocket. You can always find this or that feature a little worse than the competition, but the whole is consistent, perfect, indispensable.The Apple ecosystem at the top and ease of use avoids wasting time looking for this or that feature of use.I do not know if I could move to another OS after such a successful tool.	1
I recently changed my iPhone 4S for a 6S plus 64G, and frankly I do not regret my purchase! I have a reading light, I read a lot, in the public transport, the evening at home, and since I have this model I no longer use the tablet. By cons do not hesitate to take the 64G below it is not enough it will fill quickly. Battery side, it's just a day (I use my phone a lot to surf, music, mail, calls, ...). But now complicated to find a smartphone that exceeds the day today .... Small negative point, for people with small hands it is a little closer to a mini tablet, for my part I manage to use it with one hand but if for the small hands to "" catch "" the corners must use both hands.On pay the price of quality Apple, but it's worth it! Finally, remember to protect it with a good good hull!	1
A very frankly speaking I have a Huawei P8 great but I am equipped mac ... when I finally received after only 48h his command, my iPhone 6s PLUS ouaw shocks (nice) I transfer tanquillou without any problem thanks to advice found on the page Apple my data from P8 to 6s more ... in the process I save my data through iTunes! The foot! What to say ? When you have an Apple computer system it makes sense to take an iPhone, natural complement of the system !!! I love my P8 for the price, the fact! --- but to save it under mac and even on my PC asus hard hard it is always missing something either it only backs up its contact numbers or you have to buy a software to make its backup and it is not said that if the next phone will be saved as well! In short even with Androïd files transfer I have trouble connecting to my P8! I just made some basic tests of the 6s PLUS bug it disrupts the slow motion of the video in super quality, the contacts that were recovered tip top or even better arranged and with the photos of my contacts, the clock that offers actions that were offered to me on android but with multiple apps ... In short, 654 € for the 6s PLUS 128GB I have for my money !! The product was a refurbished product and frankly I'm happy because I had headphones better than the original ones (flat cable instead of round like that of the charger whose tips are oversized) in short I can only give 5 star to this supplier, which is well deserved !!! I am not a tester and I have not been paid to say good (unlike some testers who are offered the product for testing, I am myself tester on my website but of course I only test the products I buy) !!!	1
At first, I was really scared of being fooled but I am very happy with my purchase. The iPhone 6S plus (128gigas) is very well arrived and very quickly (in two days). Once received I made all the necessary verifications to make sure that it is a real iPhone: there was indeed a blister to cover the box of the phone, the package perfectly matched that of Apple (Precision: on the back of the box, the info and features of the device were written in Spanish, not in French.) Ditto for the user manual provided inside the box, but this is no problem because the phone can be configured in any language). Once the box opened, the iPhone was covered with the plastic that Apple uses to cover its phones. The icing on the cake: there was all the Apple accessories (charger, cables and earphones) and the phone is under warranty Apple.Bref, I received an iPhone 6s Plus, gray sidereal, 128 gigas NEW (not reconditioned) for 200 € cheaper than at Apple. It's excellent. I recommend this seller, you can order with eyes closed.	1
Satisfied	1
On one of the phones there is a disfonctinnrment. The chargers break very fast and we just have the wire. Not to connect to the mains. By this the iPhone 6s Plus 128 giga eats very quickly the battery must be charged once a day otherwise very happy and content	1
New and unconditioned device :-)	1
True new iPhone. I trust amazon quality.	1
Good protection. Adapts perfectly to my iPhone 6S Plus and accepts a full protective window which is not the case for other cases tested.	1
Hello I hope to give you the most honest opinion possibleNo how super autonomy and quality of the software super fast Call is top buy the eyes closed and finally a good size screen to surf with comfortIf you liked or found my comment useful, indicate -Me me by clicking on the button below to motivate me and to always be able to help the AmazonEt community especially do not hesitate to ask me a question I will answer as soon as possible	1
I ordered the phone as a birthday present given the prices of new iphones more and more reserved for "elite". I chose to take as an Amazon seller because at least the warranty seems more serious than other sellers. Many comments said to have received a new iPhone, I told myself that the repackaging was identical to the new so to offer it would be great. So I let myself try. The received phone (iPhone 6s Plus 32GB sidereal gray) is actually new! I do not understand how it is possible but it is the case and I know about the iPhone for 8 years always bought new. Original blister, new accessories, 100% battery status. I recommend +++	1
6S Plus 128 GB delivered a week in advance, 200 euros cheaper than Apple's website, well packaged, I'm very happy with my purchase, against the 6S Plus is really huge once you put a protective shell over it is also much heavier than my Samsung Galaxy Note, so women with small hands should not take the Plus model.	1
Accustomed to iphone c is my first passage to a large phone my last was one I was very afraid to be embarrassed and finally for now I have adapted well for edt that the use always as well	1
Nice	1
Very happy for the moment everything is fine	1
for the everyday	1
Let's take a quick look at the main strengths and weaknesses of this phone, the latest from Apple, without paying too much attention to cold numbers but, above all, to everyday use. Let's start with what I didn't like: - Weight. Yeah, the history of the rear glass to allow wireless charging has increased the bulk and you can hear it in your pocket, even in your hand it doesn't go unnoticed, but you get used to it.-The camera has a protruding traffic light. Bruttina to see makes the dancer device if placed flat on the back.-The "Notch 1". Staying on the cleat is invasive, especially if you watch videos or if the apps are not optimized, then off that portion of the display and many greetings to the big screen. - The "Notch 2". And here we go again! The diabolical black stripe that still combines us? Reduces the space for system icons in the upper part ... do you want to see the battery percentage, if the bt is on, if a vpn is active, the name of the operator, etc.? Well, every once in a while you will have to pull down the drop-down menu, the one for the "quick" settings to understand. She looks stupid, but in everyday use it's a nice break! Bad! -The remaining battery percentage. I know, I repeat, excuse me! But what the hell did it take to insert it inside the special icon? Bah! - The battery. Ok, who has had an iPhone is used to it, with intense use you don't get there in the evening, you know. But the story that on the new Iphone lasts the most is stupid. The screen oled sucks, even if there was a difference you wouldn't even notice ...- Siri. Nothing ... despite the shortcuts we are still light years away from the Google assistant. - Le animoji and the memoji. Now, with all due respect ... but what really? Or are you a 6 year old child or what would be the utility? Make you pass for a fool even during messages and video calls? What then at least save us the presentations of the river of ste ca ... stupid! -The processor. An exaggerated power even for a PC. But what are you doing with cell phones ??? If you don't plan to design Dubai's next mall or walk around like zombies for VR games, all power is absolutely useless. Marketing, point. The average user of the "very good" on Facebook and the photo of the cutlet on Instagram what should you do with it?.If you hear a crack and you hope it is the knee rather than the phone, obviously, there is a problem! -It is not 5g. Here too ... Apple we know ... of course they could have been wasted for once. Instead, guess what? No predisposition for the 5g that should arrive in 2020 in Italy. And in two years if you want to use the new band, ooops, it's up to upgrade to the new model. - The physical keys. Now the power button calls up Siri, to turn off the phone you have to simultaneously press the minus volume key and the power key, for the screenshots plus volume key and power key. Uncomfortable. - No lightning adapter / headphone jack in the package. If you want it, you pay for it separately, as does the quick charger. Tirchioni! -Do not justify the upgrade from X, few novelties and not unavoidableWhat I liked: -The processor. I know, I contradict myself, but hell! It's a splinter! Fluid, never a lag, never an uncertainty, never a delay. Smooth! -The display. The oled is a show, in any light condition it is a show. -The sound is actually improved.-The Face-Id is infallible and very fast, even with sunglasses zero problems. He even recognizes me as soon as I wake up, ok then he turns to the other side disgusted, but the phone unlocks him anyway. - The camera. Even if you are not a professional, in any lighting conditions you will always get impeccable results. - Cell phone reception, data, bt and wifi. Perfect, nothing to say.-Build quality. It is an iPhone and you can hear it! - Hardware / software integration always on top. - It is a reliable and simple travel companion in its daily use, you will never have to make too many slamming to keep it in perfect shape. - The Apple ecosystem, closed but at the same time so reassuring, and continuous updates.-The quality of the App.-It may seem silly but ... everything works fine! Certainly there are some defects, I have listed them above, but believe me, once you have this little concentration of technology in your hand, they will be overshadowed. If there are economic possibilities and you are not fond of push customization this is a phone exceptional.If you want to ask a few questions use also the appropriate function of Amazon, I will be happy to help you.	1

It is an iPhone and you can hear it! - Hardware / software integration always on top. - It is a reliable and simple travel companion in its daily use, you will never have to make too many slamming to keep it in perfect shape. - The Apple ecosystem, closed but at the same time so reassuring, and continuous updates.-The quality of the App.-It may seem silly but ... everything works fine! Certainly there are some defects, I have listed them above, but believe me, once you have this little concentration of technology in your hand, they will be overshadowed. If there are economic possibilities and you are not fond of push customization this is a phone exceptional.If you want to ask a few questions use also the appropriate function of Amazon, I will be happy to help you.	1
Excellent product in perfect condition. At the beginning I was very skeptical about buying a smartphone here, but in the end I changed my mind. The package arrived perfectly on time and in perfect condition I couldn't ask for anything better. I am an iPhone expert by now having the iPhone by 7 years and I have to say that this latest model is a bomb both in terms of aesthetics and powerI make it hard to discharge it using it almost all dayNo it never crashes! The photos are perfect and my girlfriend is crazy about it (I am now a ph) And the Face ID is really instant. Purchase highly recommended for all iPhone lovers!	1
There is not much to say about an Apple product. He found it absolutely perfect: very fast, amazing photos, beautiful materials etc. If I have to find fault with him, know that it is quite heavy, under stress it warms up a bit (nothing anyway) and sometimes, it takes a moment to load the contents of a page (I think they will solve it with subsequent updates). Apart from that, for me it's the top! The merchant Amazon is really professional!	1
No problems with the seller and the product	1
After having discharged my iPhone 6 in the last four years I changed many smartphones ... anyway the choice fell again on an Apple model .. the price is high but I have a smartphone because it is nice and fast and well done .. and especially in the use of every day is perfect, enjoyable fluid .. the battery takes me for good or bad at night about 21 hours with intense use..for the remaining advice L purchase then iOS and less restrictive than in the past increasing so The experience of use	1
What to say ...... first of all, congratulations to Amazon staff who, faced with a serious problem with the shipment of the first iPhone XS, have proved capable, professional and very friendly in sending me another new device in a short time, concluding BRAVI BRAVI E BRAVI !!!! As for the iPhone there is not much to dwell on, powerful and beautiful device signed Apple. Excellent shipping, all perfect! RECOMMENDED!	1
It is true that it costs a lot of iPhone XS but it is a whole other world. Perfect product arrived in its original box wrapped in its film	1
Excellent cell, great company staff to recover the business flaws .... I recommend buying from this company, since they gave me, slowly, everything I needed	1
Great item compared to the price comparing it to its bigger brothers (XS and XS Max).	1
After a week of use, I could not do without some very comfortable functions (face recognition, absence of the central button), compared to 7 really another phone	1
Excellent actual Apple product, no hills. Shipping in advance and well packaged!	1
For the price quality, I think that in any case, it's too high a price. But it's not Amazon's fault: the rest is beautiful and I find myself by god.	1
Perfect, I can't find the receipt	1

You don't need many lines to determine the quality of the product itself. After IPhone X this new jewel could not be missing	1
I am always an Apple customer. The model that most surprised me was the 5S. Then I switched to 6S and even there you have to say my skepticism was largely denied. I stopped and recently gave this XS. Nothing to say in terms of quality but honestly I understand why the sales of the iPhone communicate to accuse some crisis. Shooting until evening without having to top up. I forgot the use of the powerbank. Against: Weigh !!! Compared to iPhone 6S and 6 S plus it seems to be sealed. A few months later I have to say that I'm not used to it. Every time I pick up the 6S from this point of view it is a regret (it hadn't happened to me before I didn't adapt). For the rest, the absence of the home button gets you used to it very quickly. Face ID cute but nothing shocking . The rest is optimized and improved without substantial newness. If they continue to apply these price policies honestly, I don't really think that I actually cost too much. They hadn't given me a gift I would have kept the 6S for a while longer without it problems. Now if I had to go back I would have some discomfort.	1
Great product, Apple manages to put elegance and performance always united in a product in my opinion unique ... it has a very good bright screen that allows a good vision even in the sun, the camera offers many possibilities and good performance and the phone in general is very fast as Apple has always accustomed us. The price is a bit high but after all Apple has always had high prices and this year gives the possibility to buy products even at lower prices like iPhone XR which is an equally valid and performance device with a very high battery life. Product I recommend.!	1
A leap forward compared to the already stunning X, lightning-fast in reactivity, excellent photographic compartment, bright display and with a perfect definition of colors. A real technological jewel. Expensive but probably the best in the world.	1
purchased for my son antonio, yes, I am one of those submissive fathers. goodbye soldicmq perfect	1
The best phone of 2018/2019	1
The iphone arrived in perfect condition, original and sealed box.	1
Great!	1
What to say, the phone is great, if you love Apple. Fast, battery with super durability, incredible screen, beautiful photos .... don't underestimate the impermeability: mine has been saved, I fell into the water and nothing happened, another phone would have died instantly	1
the object was a gift and therefore I cannot speak of the effectiveness of the same at least for direct experience. The person to whom I gave it is a fan of the iPhone said it was enthusiastic .... Delivery times were respected.	1
A missile. Compared to the iPhone 8 it is a crazy speed. I've always had iPhones and I'm really good at it. The only drawback is perhaps the payment system with facial recognition. Less practical than the fingerprint.	1
Great seller, the phone arrived in no time, everything was perfect. A nice phone call, but it's worth it, you only live once, so why not live better	1
What about an apple product is always a great product. Lower price than others. Precise delivery.	1
Phone that works great. Fast to do anything. The top.	1
I went from 5 SE to this gem of technology ... what to say ..?! .. I garga a lot ...	1
Excellent purchase	1
Perfect	1
Perfect	1
IPhone product that does not need reviews but I wanted to emphasize the assistance of AMAZON which was exceptional as always! 100% satisfied	1
The phone is in excellent condition without any problems, the battery lasts even a day depends on the use. Definitely a great buy!	1
Great product. As expected. Arrived on time and in perfect condition.	1
I received my 64GB iPhone XS very quickly (the day after booking). The product arrived well packaged. The phone is in PERFECT conditions, very fast, precise face recognition, perfect applications, and a stunning camera. It really turns out to be an absolute top of the range.	1
Super fast! Infinite battery	1
I was hesitant to buy or not this phone from Amazon since it was a third-party retailer, I had to change my mind perfectly !!!	1
Perfect	1
Taken here on Amazon saw the lower price and then because the Amazon warranty is at the top. The product is naturally new and original and works great. I had a 7 plus changed only for the excessive size. I must say that there is a difference in performance. The camera has taken a giant step especially for night shots. For me it's the top of smartphones	1
An expensive product that I didn't buy on Amazon, unfortunately, I had lost my old 6 ..... But already being waterproof means a lot, the stability is unique, then I notice other brands that shoot mega pixels like laughing and if yes compare the photos, the Apple gives better results .. It is expensive, but when they print the electronic components, they come out with different qualities, Apple uses the choice for example a B12 processor can be of 3 choice, on the invoice mold etc. but on apple they try to test them one by one. I would have liked with the fingerprint in the back on the Apple and with the sensors adaptable to all the TVs ... Too bad for the 6 lost I would have preferred it still in front of the android ..	1
It's an i-phone! Easy, intuitive, with performance that offers you it is normal that the battery does not last long. For me it is the best smartphone on the market	1
Please forgive the bad double meaning in the title, I could not resist, but as you will understand by reading my review, the real feature that distinguishes Iphone Xs Max from the Xs is mainly this, and is perhaps also the only noteworthy one. Let's start with a premise. Despite not being a kangaroo, in the summer, I have to go around with the baby carrier. I'll explain. Keys to the home, office, car, personal cell phone, work cell phone, cigarettes (seriously harms health, ed), earphones ... I don't know where to put the stuff anymore. Another tragedy of biblical proportions, somewhat unusual, is that my partner does not like to go around with the bag, so I can also forget the classic "Love, can't you keep me 2 tons of junk?". Now let's imagine if I can afford a device that measures the beauty of almost 16 cm in height and almost 8 in width ... more covers. Come on, it's a frying pan, let's face it. Don't get me wrong, it's not always bad, but you have to deal with the clutter. For the rest Xs and Xs Max have common strengths and weaknesses, let's examine them together. Let's start from the latter. -The notch. By dint of talking badly about it alive in fear of finding it under my house with a bat in my hand. But I can't fail, it's stronger than me. The wonderful black cleat stuffed with equally wonderful and ultra-technological sensors is always in the middle of the boxes. First it takes away a portion of the screen, so photos, videos, applications will be cut or you will have a creepy dark hunchback that invades the display. Secondly it takes away space from the icons. Do you want to check the remaining battery percentage? Down the drop-down menu! Will the Bluetooth be turned on? Down the drop-down menu! What operator am I connected to? Down the drop-down menu! Is it a phone or a roller shutter? Guys, they took it out this year. The quality is not discussed, and that is paid, you know, but this Max is out of place. Much of the price is bitten melina. It is equally true that no one forces us to buy it and that, with their own money, everyone does what he wants. - The name. Iphone Xs Max. Ok, the question is negligible, I agree, but it still seems ridiculous to me.-The processor. Someone is kind enough to explain to me what you do with a phone that has a processor that could handle a shuttle? Virtual reality is still embryonic, the games don't even comment on them, saving a few thousandths of a second in posting the photo of the schnitzel with ginger sauce, on a bed of rocket, with a side of Jerusalem artichoke and sprinkle of balsamic vinegar on Instagram? But eating that gets cold, no ??? It looks ugly. What then, just enter a public office and throw away half a day, eh but the phone must be a splinter ...- The physical keys.Now the power button calls up Siri, to turn off the phone you have to simultaneously press the minus volume key and the power key, for the screenshots plus volume key and power key. Scomodo.-Siri. Nothing ... despite the shortcuts we are still light years away from the Google assistant. - No hole for the headphones and no jack / lightning adapter in the package. They risked financial ruin for the latter. - Animoji and memoji. Now, with all due respect ... but what really? Or are you a 6 year old child or what would be the utility? Make you pass for a fool even during messages and video calls? What then at least save us the presentations of the river of ste ca ... stupid! -The camera. Protruding. Ugly, at greater risk of bumps and uncomfortable. The device, if placed on its back on the back, will inevitably sway and go to the macarena. Good for lovers of Jennifer Lopez, but to me the Latin American dances suck ... also because I have the movements of a bedside table ... of Ikea ... broken ...- Battery. It has never been one of the strong points of Apple products and neither is it in this case. Slightly better than the Xs but slightly worse than the Xr. You can make it a busy day. But it doesn't advance much. -Size.Here we are. It is not a featherweight, difficult to use with one hand, the reachability function helps. In summer, if you make a long call, you will have a fantastic spot of pan on your face, complete with a bitten apple in relief. Call in the shade! It is a function to avoid melanoma. Oled from 6.5 against 5.8 of Xs. Only and only difference between the top of the range of this year. Pray.-Dimensions. Cross and delight. But do you want to show a film on such a generous display? A show also with photos. Exceptional with every light condition! 6.5 inches of pure visual perfection! If only it made me look younger it would be perfect. Instead nothing. -Face-Id is foolproof and very fast, even with sunglasses or little light zero problems. If he recognizes my big face just awake, he can recognize anyone, trust me! -Dual Sim. The new iPhones introduce dual SIM functionality into the Apple ecosystem. Which as usual does in its own way: the second card must be digital (eSIM), a format still very little popular in Italy. Too much effort to put the double slot like in China, on the other hand the phone is small ...- Photographic compartment. Difficult to get a bad photo, flawless bokeh effect. Even if you are not a professional, the results will amaze you. Video on the same level. Far beyond the normal needs of a non-professional user. -The processor. But how? Didn't you say that it was an exaggeration, that from here, that from there .... but you have to come and do the picky right here? Phew ... where did we stay before you interrupted me? Ah yes, the processor. Never a lag, never an uncertainty, always fluid, in every situation. Using this Xs Max is a pleasure. Always. With all due respect to my considerations set out between the defects and my consistency. -Audio. Greatly improved compared to previous generations. So much better that if you have Gigi D’Alessio songs in the playlists, they will be automatically deleted. - Build quality. It is an iPhone and you can hear it. Manic as always. With what it costs ... God forbid! - Hardware / software integration always at the top. It is a reliable and simple travel companion in its daily use, you will never have to make too many concussions to keep it in perfect shape. - The Apple ecosystem, closed but at the same time so reassuring, and continuous updates. store.-reception. Bt, cell phone and wifi. Never encountered a problem on the models in my possession. Connections always stable and fast. It may seem silly but ... everything works well! Certainly there are some defects, I have listed them above, but believe me, once you have this concentration of technology in hand, they will pass into the background. Basically, if you are looking for a device with a "big screen" and if bulky size and price are not a problem, you have found what is right for you. You could easily read these few lines and save yourself the rambling above. I think that tomorrow I will have to look good before crossing the road ... And the time has come for excuses. I apologize for some copy / paste too much with my Xs rece, but guys, they are the same, by now you will understand what changes ... so it's not my fault but Apple's. I also apologize to the fans of Gigi D'Alessio, Jennifer Lopez, lovers of Latin-American dances, Ikea, Apple, kangaroos, public offices, bedside tables, frying pans and cutlet. Just kidding. Maybe. With the "Notch" I do not apologize, with the one just not! I hope I snatched a smile from you and I don't know how, by rereading the review, you have been useful. What a delirium ...	1
I, as owner of the iPhone X, thought I couldn't find big differences and instead once I tried this I had to change my mind, I can't go back! Starting from the battery with excellent durability, crystal-clear screen and impressive speed. The camera takes great photos even in the dark. Consider that it is so comfortable and beautiful that you can safely use it to watch videos or movies without needing a computer. Also known improvements in the Wi-Fi sector. I hope I have been useful.	1
Hi! I can only say positive things about the iphone xs max, I have always had Apple products, there is nothing to say negative, it is a wonderful phone, with a nice display, all the features it has are of the highest quality, I recommend it to anyone!!!!!! a merit also to the obviously flawless shipment by Amazon !!!!!	1
Arrived punctually bellissimoooo	1
You just need to say the best mobile on the market! I went from my faithful iphone 6s to this. The difference is remarkable for everything. Now I have been using it for 1 week and I have only had positive experiences one after the other! - Impressive battery life: after 1 day of regular use (about 3 hours of use between phone calls, mail, social media and a few games) I there was still a poor 50/100 charge! - The wireless charge fantastic although not very fast, since apple limits it to 7.5W (suppponge choice to optimize battery life) .- A fantastic OLED screen! I compared it with the Xr version with the LCD technology screen and I guarantee you a noticeable difference! An impressive sharpness! - The camera then beats all the competitors: not so much for megapixels, which now chases them to the maximum number wins the competition <- but think about the size of the sensor: better than the beautiful pixels defined and "" large "" rather than having double "" tiny "" and poorly detailed pixels. - Where it really wins with photography, it is the chromatic interpretation, the mood, the image, that is, how it converts the phone to the data recorded in the image. Li the apple has a gear always better! - The size of the Xs Max is to get used if you come from a smaller cell phone, but no problem. - The only flaw is that it costs a lot! but it is a good investment if you have to work with your mobile phone for several reasons: 1) it maintains a good resale value2) it does not freeze to some degree below zero (as just seen with a friend in the mountains who his P20pro at -6 does not it worked the most and the iPhone continued quiet3) truly remarkable autonomy4) the 512Gb version has room for everything we need for the next 5 years5) screen resolution 2688 × 1242 pixels at 458 ppi, Contrast 1,000,000: 1 and HDR = WOWBUONA CHOICE .... even if you can't choose ... you can take it and celebrate it	1
Great product, a little heavy but obviously with 256 gb you can't ask for more. Nice great great graphics but of course it's Apple speaks for itself	1
OTIIMO AS A DESCRIPTION	1
Perfect phone, arrived sooner than expected. Very good also at the Customercare.	1
The seriousness, speed and professionalism with which Amazon carries out the service. The product was essential to be able to cope with the new tax regulations that require the use of SPID. My old phone didn't support these changes. Thank you very much for the great purchase I made with amazon and at an affordable price.	1
The hardware of this XS Max you have never disappointed me, indeed after 6 months it continues to amaze me. the brand new 7nm Apple A12 Bionic processor with 6 cores and a new 4 core GPU. In addition, the 8-core Neural Engine processor helps the phone consume less, I can get to the end of the day quietly with more than 30%, despite the use of stress. We then have 4 GB of RAM and various memory cuts: 64, 256 and 512 GB not expandable, I bought the 64 GB model and I never had any memory problems, also thanks to the cloud system. Do not miss the LTE Gigabit, dual band Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 5.0 and NFC for Apple Pay. In addition we have a new Face ID for unlocking the truly lightning-fast 3D face: so fast you will forget about its existence, it can recognize me in every situation, from darkness to the strongest light. On the left side we find the usual comfortable switch for the ringtone and also in this XS Max we have dual SIM support, with a nanoSIM and an eSIM, currently not yet available in Italy. I HIGHLY recommend it.	1
Beautiful as described	1
The phone is new, perfect from every point of view. Shipping ok. Packing ok. Nothing to complain.	1
Impeccable Amazon delivery ... I switched to this from my iPhone 6 ... this is obviously very fast, I am very satisfied, only at its weight it is necessary to get used a little ... for the rest exceeding expectations	1
great product exactly as described, photos of Amazon, reliable supplier and respond quickly to requests, I'm happy with the purchase.	1
I have always been an IPhone owner, with this new purchase I really appreciated the quality of the photos, the quality of the display and the sound. I am really satisfied he is happy to have taken the offer A € 980.	1
Arrived in a box with the sealed phone inside, amazon speed always at the top.	1
It takes a little patience and cleans the original glass well; but with the taming it is mounted perfectly.	1

It's also great the price is great. Bought just to make two phone calls and photos (always and only with animoji of course). For those who think that money is thrown away I only say that in the morning Siri's warm voice wakes me up and he also prepares coffee (coffee machine of course included in the 1400 euros). What can I say, perfection made smartphone !!	1
Produced nothing to say perfect and beautiful .. some hitch for shipping a little late, but I think it's normal on the holidays ..	1
nothing to say does his duty very well, nothing to envy of the original 50 euro covers ..	1
Arrived after a bit of trouble but it is truly exceptional. Nothing to say on the phone.	1
I am a consumer of Apple products for which nothing to complain.	1
is a beautiful iPhone screen excellent battery technology	1
Fantastic	1
I have no words to describe the magnificence of this product. The reliability of the Apple brand is at the highest levels. In this new iPhone XS Max the facial recognition is much faster and more reliable than in the past (the old iphone X didn't recognize me as easily), more fluid in use and the battery is really a bomb. With the supplied charger (from 5 watts) the recharging cycle really lasts 3h and 40 min. The device, however, is equipped with fast recharging if you have a suitable charger, in that case, you will be able to halve the recharge time (you can use that of an ipad for example). With an average use of the iPhone you will be able to make the battery last up to the evening with a residue of even 30/40%, but this depends on the use you make of it. I must stress that the duration is absolutely great long superior to the other previous models. The gold color is elegant and sober at the same time. I hope there are no future hardware problems like in my old iphone x. Product absolutely recommended, Amazon price lower than the market. The only flaw that I tend to highlight at the moment is Apple's decision to remove the connector from lightning to Aux that was previously supplied, marketing choices that, as usual, leave us a bit perplexed. You can buy it separately at a cost of € 10 always here on Amazon (it is not such an exorbitant amount). Purchased € 1098.00 in December 2018 in the 64 Gb format. Accorrete, the wonderful world of the apple is waiting for you;)	1
I need a little more time to fully judge the qualities of this phone. At the moment (I come from the iPhone 7plus) the qualitative leap is evident. In terms of speed and practicality it is a step forward. I thought I suffered more from the lack of the home button, but it didn't take long for me to get used to the new app management method. Good purchase for now	1
Excellent seller, order received in 2 days, new perfect, original product at a competitive price. Thank you.	1
Package arrived early, perfect product.	1
Its versatility is indisputable we are writing about iphone Apple ... mica bau bau pussy kitty !!!	1

Apple never disappoints.	1
No need for descriptions obvious advice a nice transparent silicone cover if you want to see the color GOLD .. I wanted to Wait mha I made a transition from iPhone 6 to this all different and not just ... you feel in your hand .... top in all	1
I like the phone a bit. I don't like the battery	1

Smartphone as good as everything then the Apple! Keep it up	1
Taken in megasconto, all perfect shipping flash product packed very well the rest is apple	1
I'm happy	1
What to say is a top-of-the-range iphone ... super fast .. huge screen but usable ... and fantastic lcd .. crazy battery I can stress the battery stretching it on and watching video .... from morning to night and I can go to sleep that I still have 45% of battery .... the phone and fast faceID super fast even in the dark ...	1
I purchased this phone during the black friday taking advantage of the discount that Amazon had applied. I waited almost a month before writing the review to test it completely and I must say that I am now fully satisfied with the purchase. My biggest doubt was about the price because I always wondered if it was worth paying so much for a cell phone. To date I must say that it is a product that has fully met my expectations. I know that one of the problems with Apple phones is the battery life and I chose this model because reading around is the model with the greatest autonomy of all iPhones and even in this respect I am fully satisfied in fact a single charge lasted me for Three days. At the moment I am fully satisfied with the product. On the seller nothing to say because it was Amazon directly as on the shipment which was very fast, arrived after just over 24 hours from the time of purchase is in perfect condition. Recommended	1
I state that I switched from an iPhone 8 to this wonderful iPhone Xr. The impact phone looks much bigger, but you get used to it ... FaceID is really amazing, never had recognition problems. For the rest there is nothing to say ... All performing as it should be! Indeed, the camera is a beast! Amazon shipping to the top.	1
Hi, I wanted to wait a while before doing a review. Original product, arrived sealed. Date of purchase 15 Nov 2018, reception 9 Jan 2019. iPhone XR for now goes great, I do not have many pretensions of a phone because I use it for work, mail, doc etc etc ... gico nothing, ingenbanti apps nothing. I changed my old iPhone 6 16gb only because the memory was insufficente, I now have this 128gb that I hope will go on for another 4 years the average I change phones.	1
the prices I have to say fluctuated a lot, but if they follow a little and you are careful you can pay (sold and sent by Amazon) on 130 euros less than the apple price; considering the reliability of the Amazon warranty I would say it's a good price. The colors at those prices I found only black and white. On the device there is little to say and on the internet you find hundreds of reviews	1
It is not the first iPhone I use and I can say that this Xr is really well done. Really brilliant screen and the battery is its strong point. There are many detailed reviews online and I can only say that this is the iPhone to buy this year. Purchased during Black Friday at a great price directly from Amazon!	1
After analyzing many reviews and comparisons between his older brothers, I decided to buy 64GB iPhone XR, and I can confirm reviews of this product. This iPhone is the best of this year in terms of price quality. While not having the OLED fool the resolution is good and the colors are as well. The range of colors offered by Apple are very beautiful, I chose the yellow, and after two months I can say that it has not yet tired me. Not having the OLED screen allows the battery to last longer, in fact with a bland use you can get to a day and a half. Instead with an intended use you can easily arrive at the end of the day. The camera is quite good, the portrait mode is the same as that of the iPhone x despite having an extra camera. In conclusion I can only recommend it.	1
Package arrived after one working day with raw materials. It comes well wrapped with the usual Apple box supplied with iPhone, charger + USB cable and headphones with lightning input. After a couple of days of use I can say that: - The face ID is precise and fast, much better than to the fingerprint reader.- The battery takes us safely in the evening after a busy day.- The camera is competitive and quality even if it's single.- I was a little skeptical on the screen, having previously had a super AMOLED come back on a LCD was not a tragedy, the color difference is noticeable at the beginning but all in all it is an excellent panel that did not disappoint me. - The dimensions are perfect, having medium sized hands, I can perfectly use it with one hand. (it's a little smaller than an 8 Plus)	1
SHIPPING: Nothing to say to Amazon, excellent as always. Ordered on Wednesday morning on Thursday at 9:00 am he was already at home, half shipping Nexive.PRODUCT: I state that I have always been an iPhone owner from 4 onwards, in December I get the mad desire to try android and buy a OnePlus 6T (great device, nothing to say but unfortunately for people like me who are used to IOS it was difficult to stay with android so I made the phone and purchased this XR). Beyond the fact that the price is high / low and all the various speeches, it's a great device for everyday use of a simple ordinary person, then it's up to everyone to decide how much and how to spend their money. The phone in its form (maybe a little grandino) is a beautiful and functional device. Great photos (even if it has a camera in less than XS it makes beautiful photos unless you have to take part in a photo contest, but I don't believe otherwise you would buy a nice reflex). Lack of 3D touch (you don't even miss it a lot because 50% you've never used it in its potential capabilities or even don't know what it is for). Great stereo sound, very smooth video, perfect touch. Display is not an AMOLED like XS but it is absolutely a nice LCD display there are those who have compared it to the iPhone 4 but they have no idea what they say, bright colors and it adapts to all the needs of visibility (night / sun / etc) if you want an AMOLED then you pay 1300 euros instead of 899 something even if it will have to change otherwise they were the same device, but as said for the camera unless you have to do who knows which projects is great. Normal speed also because it is the same XS processor. But note very very important that I had not seen yet on any iphone boys is the BATTERY, excellent durability for daily use, arriving in the evening with almost 30/35% charge. Having said that, on the web there are miles of reviews, but for what a normal person should do in the daily use the super tip !!! I repeat unless you have to make plans for NASA or photo projects the phone is a great device and in my opinion even at the right price. In the end you save almost 300/400 euros on the iphone xs / xs max and you have in your hands the same identical processor and a better battery.	1
It is the first time in my life that I purchase an Apple product: as an operating system it is rather intuitive, less inquisitive than Android. Specifically, iPhone XR has a screen that is congenial to me, very good audio, excellent connection speed. Remarkable support Apple in case of doubts or problems .. maybe he found it a bit 'uncomfortable to keep with one hand, but it is a price that I pay more than willingly for a screen like that. Amazon always very reliable: product arrived on schedule without any hitch!	1
I liked the speed of delivery (after two days had already arrived) the phone meets my expectations.	1
After several reflections I chose XR because for me if you want to stay in Apple I consider it the best choice, with the benefit of hindsight I would have taken Rosso or Giallo (live they are spectacular) the white I chose for a greater resale	1
The battery is the best iPhone I've tried so far. Personally, I'm not particularly stressed because I'm not a fan of videos and social media (with the exception of whatsapp, which I use assiduously every day), but I can still confirm that, even listening to music and working with emails and documents, the battery lasts beyond the day! For the rest, what to say .... is an iPhone !! Not very comfortable due to the size to which you get used rather quickly and which in any case also allow me to use it as a book reader. I would buy it back at 100%, although I am aware that the price is above the average of a good product of other brands .Last engraved on the shipment: product arrived in advance of 2 working days with respect to the initially estimated delivery date.	1
The product arrived within the timeframe set by the seller, is presented in a well-packed package and is exactly as described. Excellent value for money. Super product recommended for those who love Apple products. As far as I'm concerned, having switched from an iPhone 6s to an XR, I admit that the size of this smartphone is disarming! Like all things ... it's a matter of habit. Basically it is equal to a "" plus ". I also add that the quality of the photos is crazy! Costicchia is true, but Apple never disappoints.	1
Perfect phone, guaranteed assistance throughout Europe always at the high standards of efficiency and quality of Amazon (I was in Germany at the time of need). Telephone with European codes (verified), no rip-offs and no imports from other markets. Super price, 128GB phone paid 800 instead of 950 just a month after the release.	1
Coming from a 6s I can only say that this is enormously ahead. Excellent battery life and very clean and linear design. Perhaps a little excessive weight. I am very satisfied overall. purchased the evening after 22:00 and arrived before 12:00 the next day. Great price (even if after a few days it has dropped by a further 20 euros). Highly recommended.	1
Absolutely beautiful and easy to use, it finds its strength in the Face ID. The huge screen makes my previous mini-iPad practically useless. The extra long battery life and wireless charging are other pleasant surprises. In contrast, the width of the screen, the size of the battery and the large front and rear windows make it bulky, heavy, slippery and fragile. The list price certainly does not help its popularity: there are many competing products similar to a third. The quality of iOS and Apple services are not discussed: it was enough to place the old phone alongside the new and 10 minute clock to make the new phone fully operational and fully configured like the previous one. Only thanks to Amazon, and its network of valid affiliate sellers, I managed to get an excellent size of 128 GB, new with Italy warranty, discounted by 20%. Too bad the delivery wasn't very fast.	1
Purchased as a replacement for the 16gb iPhone 6, which no longer had any storage space. Ordered on the afternoon of Friday 15, arrived in not even 24 hours. Amazon's shipping is as usual unexceptionable. Arrived in an anonymous box, inside it I found the original apple box with all the components: various chargers, earphones and booklets. At the moment the phone looks like a great device, I expect it to last at least as long as the predecessor	1
I have been using the phone for more than a week now, no problems have yet been revealed, photo and video quality really good. I switched to this XR (blue 64Gb model) from a medium / high end Samsung, but only after a week I would never go back. The price is very expensive compared to other non-Apple devices with similar features, but as always the Apple brand is always a guarantee. I recommend it for those who want a beautiful, high-end, aesthetically pleasing phone.	1
I bought my iPhone XR in blue, simply spectacular, excellent quality photos and the zoom camera for portraits (external camera) works really well even using only the software. A phone that despite having differences with respect to x you notice little and nothing. At first it will be a bit difficult to leave 3D Touch but it will get used to it after a while. Great article	1
iPhone has always been a quality product, and this XR has nothing to envy to iPhone XS, of course, it has something less, but it is the right phone for those who want all the Apple quality at the right price that does not rise above € 1000 . TECHNICAL FEATURES An Apple A12 bionic processor, which gives it the same potential as the XS series, performs well during daily use, never noticed any type of slowdown. end of the day with a measly 15% supports wireless charging. The largest LCD screen of the XS series and slightly smaller than the XS Max, is something in between, the resolution is obviously lower. Camera with a 12 mpx lens very good to take pictures but sins on the night side, nothing to say for the portrait photos, it must detect a face, if it detects it then it makes a nice photo. Very good audio but also no audio jack hereFace ID very convenient and slightly faster than the predecessor hours iPhone XIn general this is a very valid product and is recommended for those who want to enter the Apple world. Let's say for the starters.	1
Very beautifull! The day arrived. It is my first iPhone and I must say that I will never go back to expensive Android !! iPhone is another story. I took this but if you also take 8 it's a smartphone bomb and the price starts to be better already! Price quality of this model? There are no words on quality, but the price is too high !!	1
One of the best orders I've ever made: the product arrived earlier than expected and the price is cheap!	1
the best of both worlds in terms of memory capacity and camera clarity. great sound too	1
Great terminal. The resolution, much criticized, is absolutely not a weak point but in my opinion a strong point. In a display of this size, high resolutions are only advertising, this instead allows a lower consumption and an even longer battery life. Great display, fantastic sound. Monstrous battery!	1
Apple does not deny, this is also a great device and that thanks to the perfect integration between the various apps allows you to take full advantage of all the potential of this iPhone. In the previous 7 years I always had iPhone (5 and 6s) and after the sudden "death" of the last I wanted to give Android a chance by buying Huawei p20 pro: 500 € absolutely thrown away. With iPhone you go on the safe side and you are never wrong!	1
I have tried so many Apple and Android phones and the XR I find it great: very fast, the battery lasts more than a day even with intensive use, sometimes up to two days. For the rest what to say, the usual ergonomics of the iPhone, unattainable by all the tried Android and the excellent ergonomics and intuitiveness of Apple and iOS. Also interesting is the possibility of having 2 SIMs, even if one of the 2 is virtual and currently in Italy is hardly exploitable. The only real flaw is the impossibility of expanding the memory. It would be preferable to have a real file system that gives the possibility to organize documents and files in folders. Too bad for the lack of optical zoom and that the display, although excellent, does not reach the quality of other OLEDs even in much cheaper phones. The price is a bit high but the quality is paid and the durability is superior to many other models.	1
Fast seller, I paid and the next day sent me the product that arrived with 2 days in advance. Recommended, keep it up As for the phone, there is nothing to say; amazing. The transition from the iPhone 6 to the XR is huge. Beautiful aesthetically, fast and the biggest screen is of an incredible comfort. Recommended product.	1
Technically advanced battery much better comfortable to use even with one hand	1
I am satisfied with the choice of this iPhone. More economical than XS. The purchase on Amazon allowed me a saving of almost € 50 compared to the Apple Store. It was delivered in one day and obviously in accordance with the order	1
Needless to review, they talked about it far and wide! Great phone, a bit heavy, if we want to find a flaw (208 grams). Compared to the XS it loses a rear camera, 1 Gb of RAM and has an LCD screen, which in return is 6.5 "against 6.1" of the XS (Oled).	1
Amazon guarantee the best ever, delivered the day after the order, perfectly packed. NEW. I go from a Samsung s8 to this iPhone and I feel really good, great phone. Battery life depends on the use you make, for example I have to charge it every night!	1
I gave this iPhone XR for Christmas and the lucky recipient uses it with great satisfaction. The phone is very fast, the screen is bigger than an X or XS and even if it's not OLED, the image quality is excellent. Battery life is phenomenal. I advise	1
It's perfect, the battery has an excellent durability, it's almost as big as a plus, the only small flaw I've read have found other people too, it's that it can't connect with the headphones I use for sports.	1
What can I say, I am very satisfied, delivered ahead of the scheduled date. I saved money compared to other sellers, original product and not with brand telephone operator.	1
great phone arrived working perfectly	1
Impeccable amazon with perfect shipping times, the product exceeds expectations.	1
Remarkably longer battery life than my old IPhone 7, much larger display, really nice	1
The shipping was very fast, the smartphone is perfect and working. The feature that I liked the most is the size, a cross between the small and the big !!!! excellent working tool	1
Great product, as already mentioned in the iPhone title in my opinion is equivalent to guarantee, in addition the colors of this model make it really appealing!	1
superlative	1
The phone has excellent performance is a good value for money (at least: by examining the other products of the same house). The battery that lasts several days considering, even, an intensive use of the device is not indifferent.	1
Perfect phone, as I expected. Very satisfied, apart from the price that went up when I made the purchase. I had spotted him when it cost a little less. But anyway, we're talking about a Mr. phone. Pack arrived very punctual, without any damage.	1
Arrived the next day. Very beautifull. The evaluation is due to the characteristics of the telephone and not to the shipment. As with other iPhone models, the battery lasts a day at most, depending on how much you use it of course. For the rest, the phone is perfect.	1
The brand says it all ... having already had small cmp ... hoping for a battery that over time does not become harder.	1
Why buy from apple if the same product here costs much less? Nothing to say is an Xr iphone	1
C is just to say that it is an iphone. From a track to everyone. Fast shipping. Very serious seller.	1
Original product, sealed package, exceptional performance, punctual delivery	1
Few words. APPLE.QUALITY: Apple then warranty. PRICE: AMAZON. Definitely lower	1
My favorite phone. Nice, practical, fast. I love it. It was just the way I wanted it. Then I really like the iPhone. I had the iPhone 6 and I wanted a more powerful and newer one, so I took this and I'm satisfied.	1
Smartphone compliant with the description. Box intact and delivered earlier than expected. Better price than Apple Store. Great purchase!	1
As I imagined Apple never disappoints me ... Really a good product	1
beautiful product, performing, elegant.	1
Perfect	1
Great product super-fast arrival, from late morning to evening. How to buy it in the store only spending less	1
I liked the speed with which it was shipped, the fantastic design of the Apple. I would have expected more from the internal camera, especially in the low light photos.	1
Great product punctual delivery, with Apple you can never be wrong.	1
I had an iPhone 6 plus and I must say that this model is gorgeous. Spectacular graphics, and excellent value for money	1
Excellent battery life and exceptional face detection. High quality photos.	1
The red model is simply spectacular. Great phone and nice pictures, but color is the thing that sets it apart!	1
Duranta battery with average usage is two days. It is a bit too bulky for my taste	1
shipping is fast enough. I feel good with iPhone XR, there is no quality problem. very comfortable with Face ID. The battery lasts a full day for me (normal chat, little play,)	1
I liked everything. A great phone with excellent battery and processor performance as I wanted it	1
And always Apple and it's a beautiful phone, recommended really good battery life	1
what about we talk about a super great product Iphone xr	1
timely delivery, perfect smartphone, beautiful color	1

Excellent smartphone, as always Apple does not deny and manages to create a device of excellent materials and smooth and fast operation, excellent screen even if not OLED as the brothers XS and XS max and really high performance camera.! Bello also the fact of being able to choose more colors. The price is always very high and in any case more affordable than the other new Apple models	1
after the bad end of my iPhone 6S, I needed to buy a new iPhone (always true to the apple!). I was strongly undecided between XR and XS but then I thought that the difference of € 250 was not justified and so here I am with the XR in my hands. capacity, color and size are subjective so I will not dwell on these issues. AESTHETICS: then it is not at the level of XS for example, indeed I find that some colors make it look like a toy but once put the cover goes all in second flat. BATTERY is infinite, never happened to me that I could not download a phone even though I wanted to. mainly use whatsapp Facebook and instagram, I call and take pictures, nothing else. and although I live with the phone in hand, the battery takes an eternity to discharge, never seen anything like that.FOTOCAMERAwow, really a very good level compared to my old model (but it is also obvious), above all I was surprised by the photos made in the dark, they are very bright and come well! in general I find it is an "inexpensive" model that is worth much more than the top range of other brands! I only noticed 2 flaws, but we are serious ?! how should i put the phone on the surfaces? finding a cover that corrects this defect is not quite as simple as it sounds. there is no headphone jack: again, but are we serious ?! I don't think it's nice to push buyers to buy the adapter or the airpods (given the inexpensive cost of the phone)	1
The biggest differences between XR and X are the size (larger XR of the X) and the camera (better than the X). I never tried the X camera but the XR one is excellent and not I would like better, while I find the screen bigger an important advantage! As a woman or for those with small hands, the XR is a bit bulky, a little awkward to handle. For example, you can't use it by holding it with one hand. Durable battery, beyond the 2mmars, using it enough. Despite the bulk I would buy it again!	1
Great phone !!! I have always had android ... I decided to move to the Apple world and for now after 2 months of use, even if they are not many .. I can not complain at all! And the famous immediacy of use of Apple smartphon is real !!	1
Coming from the year of Android I can say that there is no comparison pee regarding the operating system .. Ios is a marvel, the camera is of excellent quality even if it is simpler, the battery with normal use guarantees two days, the face is not misses a beat .. I was surprised by this smartphone I would buy it again	1
I do not have a review with verified purchase because I took it directly to the Apple store. The usual iPhone is perfect in both the hardware and software parts. It is the right compromise to stay at home without spending too much.	1
The package arrived before the scheduled date from Amazon, inside the receipt, the perfect package in everything and for everything packed in a more than safe way! Fantastic phone, similar battery for now has no flaws.	1
Everything perfect, another € 170 discount on the list price with Italian warranty. Ordered at 10pm and delivered home the day after at 2pm ... what about Amazon the TOP	1
The phone arrived intact in time, super protected by films, as if it had been purchased from the store .... for now I find it magnificent .... we'll see how it behaves later.	1
Very useful phone, very fast. Only that the delivery arrived after 2 weeks but I am satisfied	1
Beautiful and perform	1
Come on, there are only a few characters left and then I can finally say that IPhone XR was a great buy	1
After trying the whole iPhone series I arrived at XR attracted, I don't deny it from XS Max (but unusable due to size) and in love with the 8 plus (the perfect smartphone to date) it was too much the attraction to explore XR: it will be the colors ... but the same colors reminded me of that iPhone C which was objectively a low end of the iPhone and a phone abortion that didn't deserve the bitten apple printed above. Well, XR has absolutely nothing to do with 8 plus, even with iPhone C, indeed ... just taken in hand gives the feeling of a small ingot built with skill and design but that transmits sensations of solidity in a Factor form that no iPhone had ever given: the perfect size! It is held with one hand, yes it manages perfectly and has a very wide view perfect for multimedia use. Stratospheric audio as only iPhone knows how to give. Materials and construction that really convey a Premium feeling. With XR you find the substance but also the beauty, the colors of art! What a masterpiece this XR boy is, finally on Amazon at an honest price you are faced with 10 reasons to buy XR and preferable to the whole iPhone range (X, XS and XS Max included!) : 1) fantastic display: brightness that absolutely does not regret an Oled, rather ... in the light of the sun every time you thank him for having it!) 2) solidity in pure state in perfect dimensions (with the X version and I watched the videos I thought "" this display is really small "" 3) art: beautiful colors, I chose black, a classic but also an ingot of black gold! Pure perfection, the edges are not noticed and give a feeling of absolute beauty.4) autonomy: here there is no comparison with any iPhone in history: 8 hours of active screen which is more than a day of intense use5) reception: with XR I have almost full signal in areas where with X or 8 plus I had problems mainly in the cellar where I usually have no signal with this XR I have 2 notches, honestly I do not know why but I think it is a set of factors (antennas, processor, materials) 6) face unlock: the future, recognizes the face in every light condition even in the dark ... every time you have to download an app, open a protected app ... face unlock makes the difference, in fractions of seconds it's everything ready without having to make any clicks! 7) A12 Bonic 7 nanometer processor = low consumption and stratospheric speed8) XS / XS Max camera but with a single lens that is not only well protected thanks to the "XR" design but it is also beautiful! Yeah ... you don't have that classic traffic light that now all Chinese phones have copied! 9) Absence of traffic lights and originality, if you have XR YOU SEE! Don't confuse it with 100 other models produced by the whole world with a traffic light camera. If you want to be noticed it is XR that identifies the bitten apple of Cupertino! 10) Last reason: with XR you get the best iPhone model and you get 400-500 with which you can buy your wonderful Apple Watch 4! 'true iPhone is XR! If I have been useful just a click! :) All good to all and good iPhone XR! ———- November 29: Apple informs us that iPhone XR is the best-selling iPhone ever!	1
New product still packed, exactly like the one sold in the apple store! If you know how to seize the moment, you can pay it considerably less than at the Apple store (got 128gb for € 799 instead of € 949).	1
Maybe because I have been buying APPLE for 18 years, it will be that I loved STEVE JOBS since it only sold products that nobody bought, but this XR was a surprise. . he had asked me why all the classmates had that brand that made FICO. Then, every night, he always asked me for my APPLE 8 PLUS and left the new one on the LUNCH table. AT THE END he asked me to change it with the XR. LESS EVIL THAT WAS AMAZON PRIME !! SAID DONE: returned the product and purchased the XR. Revolutionary product compared to my 8, total screen, brightness and colors unattainable for my DEVICE. It reads everything like a KINDLE for clarity of characters and contours of letters and images. Different gestures in the access phase to the screens but, as always with APPLE, immediate and intuitive. MACHINE photos at the level of my 8 even if in my humble opinion still my terminal if the PLAY with the XR in terms of depth of field and brightness of the lens. The last advantage of the XR is that it is very long but narrower than my 8. So WE READ GOOD chat and FB and ONLINE NEWSPAPERS without having to keep scrolling down the page given the screen size in length. BUY NOW WITHOUT DOUBT	1
After hearing many conflicting reviews on this smartphone I decided to buy it and test it with my hands. Design: ok, the edges more marked than the more expensive xs and xs Max are seen and in some ways may seem ugly but believe me that if do not compare them within a day you will get used to it and you will fully enjoy the nice and elegant design of this phone. Display: perhaps the most criticized and in my opinion unfairly. Then the 326 may seem few but they are not. The display is well defined, ok, there are more defined ones, I myself come from a note 9 which has a display with over 500 ppi and if compared, you can see the difference but in everyday use you don't absolutely notice. The thing I appreciated is the quality of the panel from all other points of view. It is the best LCD display on a smartphone. Blacks are not absolute as an oled but they are very close, almost perfect viewing angles and the most amazing thing is the balance of colors that are very faithful to reality. A fundamental aspect for those like me who work with photography. Battery: exceptional. The iPhone with the longest life ever produced by Apple. You arrive at the end of the day using stress with plenty of 25/30% Camera: it is the most advanced camera on iPhone at the moment, along with the xs. Beautiful photos, sharp and the smart hdr is a bomb. I personally don't regret the second room I also had on the iPhone 7plus. All the features of the most expensive iPhones remain except for some portrait modes and of course the 2x zoom. The front camera instead is exactly the same as xs.That is to say, the most balanced iPhone ever. It is not cheap but it is a phone that dismantles all efforts by competitors to focus on technical specifications. You don't need a 4K display, you don't need 2.3 or 4 cameras. iPhone XR focuses on the user experience and I must say that it succeeds in full.	1
I purchased this iPhone XR to replace my still working 6S, after almost four years of honored career. What convinced me apart from Apple that it is already a guarantee? The color I fell in love with at first sight, the performance and last and not least, the price of Amazon, without a doubt the most convenient on the market!	1
What to say! The much mistreated iPhone XR goes to thunder! Lightning fast, never a lag, never an uncertainty! Very pleasant to use, and a practically infinite battery! I have heard criticism for the "cornices" (they are there but they are not so invasive), for the screen (it will not be Oled, but it is an excellent display perfectly calibrated) etc etc. It is a very reliable terminal, pleasant to use, without frills, but still swanky in colors! Dxomark has elected it the best single room telephone! In short, highly recommended to those who want an Apple terminal, with large battery, without unnecessary and expensive frills! The only flaw? The price: too high! Let's say a € 100 too much!	1
Great price for a device that has just arrived on the market. Apple is always the best choice in terms of quality and ease of use. While not having the retina screen like its big brother, the difference is not noticed very much during a standard use. Excellent purchase	1
I liked the price. SENSATIONAL AMAZON. Bought during a trade war between mediaworld and Amazon. Storage 256gb at 802 euros. Great price quality. I had a lot of iPhones but I have to say that it has everything I need: big screen, great camera (Halide app tip for blurred effects even on objects and animals), fast with the A12 Bionic chip, battery that arrives quietly at the end day. I come from an iPhone 6s and the transition was super positive.	1
In the end I too, like many others, opted to purchase this model at the expense of others (X, XS and XS Max) and I must say that I am very happy ... (I didn't try them though!). The lack of 3D Touch in favor of Haptic is not so fundamental. It is very beautiful aesthetically, the battery lasts a lot (2 days) and the advantage of the Apple Software for app functionality and reliability is unquestionable compared to Android, even if before I owned an excellent Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact! The delivery was a little slow (for the Christmas holidays) not due to the excellent seller. The phone is perfect but does not come from Italy and the slightly lower price is justified here.	1
What to say is an iPhone, a product of excellent quality and for better or for worse whoever takes it knows what to expect. The delivery was more than fast, amazon was surpassed one month in advance on the scheduled date and thanks to a super offer the price was almost unparalleled! Great	1
Arrived as if it were a raw shipment, perfect packaging, undamaged phone with its original box. Open and turned on without any problem, the description of the seller is excellent. Recommended	1
I bought this beautiful smartphone, everything perfect. Excellent shipping as usual. The price: good only that the day after Amazon decides to lower it by 60 € and I believe that it is not correct and for this I give only one star. I also tried to call the Amazon switchboard but obviously they tell me that nothing can be done.	1
Great product, the battery lasts very long I can get to 2 days almost. Fast shipping as always Amazon	1
Excellent product arrived within the expected time seriousness of the seller. Product very well done fast the processor. cellphone quality well above the range of mobile phones with the same characteristics. exceptional amazon	1
Great phone. The differences with the two top models are there but they are relative: I preferred to have a battery that lasts me more than two days rather than having an oled screen	1
The item arrived in less than 24 hours, exceptional. Packed perfectly and well protected. At the moment it does not present any kind of anomaly. Really excellent price.	1
Product in line with expectations, excellent performance of the processor, very high performance photography High price but generally good value for money	1
The phone is fast and has a good battery life, the LCD display is large and it is very clear, Amazon shipping as usual fast and on time.	1
After years of android we can appreciate the difference both in software and in hardware	1
Satisfied. Even if in the Android world for the same price you will find cell with a more powerful room	1
Incredible phone. Taken for a gift. It was super appreciated. The white color is very elegant.	1
Perfect in everything. Fantastic photos, finally good battery life.	1
perfect, very beautiful and arrived in no time.	1
super,super	1
Great smartphone, fast delivery	1
Great phone! Fast and early delivery.	1
I liked everything	1
Arrived early and well packed.	1
Purchased at a lower price than the price list. Sold and shipped by Amazon. The phone is definitely a good product. The LCD screen that everyone really despises is really great. Certainly making a comparison with X or XS would not make sense, we are talking about two different panels. And of course it costs less than the latter. The photocomera does its job well thanks to the software optimizations. Faster than the X model. Incredible battery life compared to the old models. Surely the edges are thicker but I must say that after a while this thing is no longer noticed because they are very homogeneous. I recommend buying it if you find it at a lower price than the list price.	1
I have always been an apple fan and I must say that this xr is fantastic and I recommend it and it has an acceptable cost	1
Very beautiful	1
now I am not going to do a complete review, that there are plenty of them around ... I just want to highlight what struck me about this iPhone: - the quality of the new generation LCD screen, the Liquid Retina - the exceptional autonomy battery, the most "long" ever for an iPhone (even on the screen) - and the camera is not bad either ... it has only one lens but it's bigger ... sure iPhone XS Max and some Latest generation Android do better, but it is well defended ... and all in all this FaceID does not go wrong ... honestly I thought worse ...	1
Really an excellent phone	1
Beautiful iPhone, come first, save something super reliable	1
Excellent product immediate delivery super competitive price	1
It's a fantastic phone ... Apple always the n1 extra long battery, exceptional camera and optimal phone performance	1
All very well	1
Perfect	1
It is a top of the line phone and behaves as such. The price is notoriously high and limits its diffusion and even the final judgment.	1
Everything good	1
All right	1
With the release of the new Iphone and above all of the Xr, Apple has removed from the list the X, not so much because it is obsolete, but precisely to avoid that the two smartphones could overlap in the choice of the users and not to see the sales of the new born diminished from its predecessor. So it is more than legitimate to ask oneself which one should buy, let's see if I can remove some doubts about it. Let's start with the differences. Indeed no. I want to immediately take my mind off. "The notch". The hateful black cleat is, unfortunately, I say, present on both. Come on, now all the menate on sensors pass, projected dots, face recognition, which incidentally work wonderfully, but band is always in the middle of the boxes! Do you want to check the battery percentage, or if Bluetooth is on, or the name of the operator, etc.? You have to constantly pull down the drop-down menu. Let me understand, processors that not even NASA to speed up the use of a few tenths of a second and then I have to do up and down like with a shutter even to see how much charge I have left? Not to mention the wonderful effect it makes on videos, photos and games. Do you want to put the effect of a nice holiday movie with a black strip? But like we did without it, I wonder. I can understand the technical needs, but in everyday use it is disgusting. Well ... now that I stalked the notch and took off a weight, we really move on to the differences between the two terminals in question.-The size and quality of the screen. X has a 5.8 oled that supports the hdr and the Xr a 6.1 lcd. The X wins for quality. Higher contrast and higher pixel density, not that the "liquid Retina lcd" of the Xr is ugly, on the contrary, it is more than good for most of us, it is clear and looks good in any light condition. It's just that oled does all this a little better. The Xr wins on dimensions. Those who like the large display should have no doubts. -The 3D Touch. There is on the X but not on the Xr. I will not throw a hackle at the use of this feature, I can only say that you live well without it. However, this is enough to win the X. - Use with one hand and portability. What I tell you to do ... however the Xr is a good compromise and not too uncomfortable. -Battery. Here the Xr wins hands down. You want to have dimensions, you want the LCD to take less, the fact is that you arrive at the end of the day quietly. A nice plus for many. Wireless charging for both, although I find it inconvenient as it does not make the smartphone usable except for contortion and more wear on the battery compared to the cable in the long run. It can be useful in overseas travel where this standard is widespread in many places, from the airports to Starbucks. Cost. With the exit from the list and various offers the prices are the same. Goalless draw. However expensive, the melina is paid ...- Processor. The prize goes to the Xr. It's slightly faster, around 15%. Will we notice it in everyday life? Hardly. The X is always very fluid and responds well in all situations.-Weight. Twenty grams less for the X, I know, it's just funny to say. You need to have butter instead of your arm to make it a discriminating factor. Even if you wanted to get it over your head, you wouldn't notice it. -Materials. This too is pretty funny. However those of the X are more "noble", steel against aluminum. As if we didn't put them in improbable cases or passed them all day to touch them. However the "naked" one is more resistant to scratches. Everything here. - Software updates. For personal data the Xr is in advantage, if it is your intention to keep it for a long time it is a variable to consider, being born a year later it should have on the card even a year more updates. Colors. Black and white for X, black, white, blue, yellow, coral and red for the Xr. If you have to match it with the color of the upholstery, the latter wins. Face Id. Fast and impeccable on both. On the Xr it has improved in speed and precision. But it works regardless. Well, water resistance. IP67 certified, so they are resistant to 1 meter dives up to 30 minutes. Draw.-Quick top-up. Another draw with cable and power supply sold separately. -Rams. Three gigabytes for both. And you live peacefully. - Camera. A single camera for iPhone XR, two cameras including a zoom for iPhone X. iPhone XR relies on software and image processor to do some of the things that iPhone X does with optics, this last solution is normally preferred. They both have a 12 MP sensor, optical video image stabilization, both record 4K video up to 60 fps, and both allow slow motion up to 240 fps. The front camera is identical between the two terminals, although on XR it can record 1080p video at 60 fps. To the advantage of the iPhone XR, in addition to the depth control, the presence of Smart HDR, which uses different technologies to give photos more points of light and detailed shadow areas. In a nutshell, however, in the "normal shot" or in the wild selfie, we won't notice any particular differences and both solutions don't disappoint. I speak as a basic user, certainly not as a professional photographer, just specify. In the photograph each of the two has strengths and weaknesses that are balanced with respect to the competitor. For me also in this field it is a draw. But we come, you will finally say, to the conclusions. If you want a screen with greater diagonal and battery life, go to the new born from Apple, if screen quality and portability are important to you, the tenth anniversary iPhone still has a lot to say. Yeah ... because despite the Divine Comedy that I presented to you, the differences are not many, as I said before, the Apple foxes would not have removed the X from the price list otherwise ... Choose according to your needs and why not , especially based on the offers you find in the various stores. I hope I have been helpful, I remain at your disposal for any other questions.	1
There is not much to review. As a loyal customer of the Apple world for over 16 years, who is familiar with original packaging and accessories, I can only confirm that I could have made a great deal, buying an absolutely virgin product, with undamaged packaging and with particular original wrappers as it was purchased at any Apple Store, saving at the same time a good deal of euros. In relation to the expense, I did not make any problems in choosing, during the order, the Express shipment. The product arrived in about 18 hours from shipment. Sure I will buy again from this seller as soon as the next top range iPhone by will be available in the catalog.	1
Initially I was a bit hesitant, but I trusted the reviews and I proceeded with the purchase, all perfect and with a considerable saving compared to the Apple list. The phone arrived sealed in its original packaging, nothing to complain.	1
Paid 770, a smartphone that currently has nothing or almost to envy to rivals or older brothers. I will not dwell too much because reviews around there are plenty of them, I will limit myself to stressing that it is worth pointing out even though I have a year behind me. This or xr? Personally this, a much higher display and comparable performance if you don't focus on the benchmark numbers.	1
He has gone from an old 4S to the iPhone X. For me a welcome confirmation on Apple products which I also own Tablet and Computer. The newly purchased smartphone is very nice especially in the display of excellent resolution. Excellent also the camera and the many features that only iPhone offers, in short, a unique product of its kind. The service provided by the Digitech P seller was also excellent. In addition to delivering the product to me earlier than expected, it was always very helpful, kind and prompt to my every request.	1
Impeccable seller, trouble-free product, purchased and received in the stated times. I had all the apple models so I know the product very well, unbeatable for me. All perfect. I recommend this seller. Top	1
Excellent phone, iPhone X offers excellent performance, both for the convenience and for the speed of the system, fast shipping and well looked after in the package!	1
I waited a while before reviewing. I hesitantly bought a cell phone online. Arrived early, super wrapped and packed to get through the trip. The product arrived intact. It works and there have never been any problems. I wrote to the seller for the invoice to take advantage of the guarantee and there were absolutely no problems. The phone is beautiful. Of course the price could be lower, but being an apple, there is nothing to say.	1
Bought on offer to take the place of the now ancient iPhone 6. What to say? The battery lasts almost a full day, the Face ID works great and is of incredible comfort. Excellent photographic compartment, excellent quality screen, processor and RAM give an excellent speed of use. The only flaw is the considerable weight, but for value for money is a purchase that is difficult to regret.	1
Complete package of all components and with intact packaging. Telephone completely intact and working. As indicated by the Prime option, delivery in lightning time, the same day of the black friday after only 18 hours from the order.	1
Perfect arrived on time and in perfect condition	1
Taken as a gift. Paid less than the XS series which has nothing to envy (externally identical, almost similar functions). Very beautiful. Sold and shipped by Amazon, an absolute guarantee!	1
Great phone, both in style and invoice. An elegant combination of glass and steel that unfortunately make it slippery and probably fragile in the fall. Excellent reception. For the many technical specifications, I have yet to learn about it. Satisfied.	1

Two purchases for the same product fast shipping, well tracked, product ok, product code as described in the Italian version. The second: everything ok as the first for shipping and product, but non-Italian code (Danish or Swedish). Too bad, even if the version is not influential on the functionality of the product, I purchased here because the product code was well specified in the listing. I repeat, sin, I would have definitely bought again, but here we think that people buy then without checking if the product is as stated. Thanks anyway.	1
The iPhone has arrived punctually, respecting the delivery terms, in its original packaging and even if I use it for a few days, I am very satisfied.	1
I ordered this iPhone X from the Bacom seller. After 4 years of Android I wanted to try the IOS experience and I have to say that for now it's fine. The seller was very fast. Delivery was estimated after 10/12 working days but after 2/3 days it arrived and everything with free shipping. Very satisfied. Convenient price.	1
I state that I did a madness, that it was a dream for me to get my hands on such a beautiful product. I always had 200-300 euro phones but having seen the offer on the black friday I could not resist and I decided to take it ... I come from a samsung s6 which obviously did its years and the battery left me halfway day .... I think this product needs no introduction, those found on the net ... I can only tell you that as a passionate user I find myself very well, all fluid, never a block, beautiful photos and fantastic design .. arrived in one day with amazon prime .. everything perfect !!	1
Excellent smartphone, fast and elegant design. Expensive, like all iPhones.	1
I'm not a phone fanatic and I'm not always there ready to change model every year, but for simple personal tastes I always choose Apple when I have to do it. where we started this new model is a beautiful achievement. I've been using it for a week so I still have to find out completely about the features, but right now I can say that the choice of removing the home button is absolutely winning, the face ID is fantastic and the new HDR screen makes its figure. With the changes we have to take a little hand at the beginning! Serious and reliable seller, everything arrived in perfect condition.	1
The purchase did not happen on Amazon but reviewing this article, for me as a fan of the Apple brand, is a pleasure. I don't want to make comparisons with other models of the most recent house that I consider different for some details but not better characteristically, and certainly you can't compare it to its predecessors since, the X, is much more evolved. I will concentrate on this model trying to simplify the incredible innovations without falling asleep to read its WIDE manual. Material: steel and then scratch-resistant with ultra-resistant glass screen.Home: without key but with scrolling from bottom to top, the first in Apple's historyThe control center with curtains from top to bottom starting from the right. These allow faster access with minimal movement. The screen has an impeccable image resolution and the dual camera is the best ever installed from the house with new features such as portrait, Live Photo etc ... true depth camera for facial recognition too unique and perfect in operation. Apple starts this new generation of iPhone by installing awesome and very useful apps like: home kit and health envied and a little copied. I've heard about battery problems that download too quickly: 1 charging with cable from the possibility of recharging 50% of the battery in the first half hour. 2 we can always use it with energy saving mode.3 but whoever we want to make fun of, is so surprising that we use it continuously; check "usage time" if you haven't done it yet. It is true that the screen uses a lot of battery but it is also true that this is the right compromise for a high quality vision. I would like to tell you about all those possible features and compatible Apple accessories that are used to make the most of all those apps but for this there will be another time or you can directly ask me questions since I read that ample operating manual I read and reread and I know for sure that I could go on and on in describing it. This is just the brand reviewer with a smattering of what to me is a 5-star article that I recommend to evaluate. I am still available ... bye	1
I state that it is the first Apple device I buy, having always used Android phones. At the first power up I had some problems with the configuration as I had a sim cut off, which the phone didn't recognize. After buying a new sim, it was a pleasant discovery every day. The transition to iOS was simpler than expected and was much more intuitive than believed. As for the smartphone it is perfect. It does not have any type of problem at the level of processor or RAM, so no lag and immediate opening of the app. Never crashes. The reception of the operator network is perhaps smaller than the other top of the range, but always present. Also the Wi-Fi navigation is excellent with the signal that is immediately acquired and maintained. The Hardware component is definitely the highlight of the product. The front and rear glass gives elegance and a good grip. Superb play of light from black to silver that is created on the back with light. Front and rear camera from the top of the range, perfect for daily use. Effective instant identification in recognition and release even in conditions of total darkness with only light of the smartphone to illuminate us. The screen is wonderful for the eyes and the glass is fairly oleophobic. The frames are made of stainless steel to give greater resistance to impact. However the borderless design causes the risk that falling on the edge will cause the liquid crystal of the screen to break. Paid on amazon 969 euros. Surely the price is out of the market and excessive. At much lower prices there are equally competitive phones (to stay on identical iPhone 8 specifications). However, holding this device is unlike any other. Definitely to be purchased only for status.	1
Perfect iPhone, fast delivery and secure package closed for good. The phone had its original seal. I admit I had some doubts before buying and I hope this helps others since there were no reviews here. Reliable seller at 100% and available	1
Great phone, I come from a now outdated iPhone 6 and the differences with this device are noticeable is like !! A little perplexed as regards the courier after reading several negative reviews on the internet .. but I personally have not found any kind of problem !! Express in 3 days as usual Amazon.	1
It is equal to the various comments heard and seen on various press organs and on iPhone Italia. It is a product with excellent simplifications and a very rapid exercise. Everything becomes much easier and faster. There are new commands (swic) instead of the home button that you absolutely don't regret once you are familiar with them. It has an extraordinary OLED screen that transmits images with extremely real colors .. Everything is at hand. As read, it is a question of opening a window on the future of telephony.	1
I bought this model because I am fine with the Apple system. The shipment was on time and the friendly seller answered my questions in a short time. The phone is practical although slightly larger than the usual phones. The screen is fantastic	1
iPhone X is the top for those who love Apple products, those who use iOS will immediately find themselves at ease and will start to love it for its simplicity of use and its display. Top!	1
Fast delivery, perfectly packaged original product, the phone needs no comment, it's great.	1
Great product as described. Arrived on time. Great!	1
After having cut it expected, because it arrived after the planned (with so much anxiety!) I can only say that it is a great purchase!	1
Excellent product for the price at which it is offered. Highly recommended!	1
Everything perfect as described. I am very satisfied.	1
Perfect	1
Great product!	1
Usual packaging, usually content. Slow charger (takes about 3 hours to charge), wired headphones (with adapter for standard 3.5), pin, stickers, data cable. Beautiful touch and feel of steel. Better than aluminum. Smoother, more polished. But the other side of the coin is the weight. At first glance it seems heavier than its 174 grams. It is at the limits of one-handed usability but is not particularly slippery. Personally I find it very beautiful. Front. Behind the camera a lot of jars, especially in white color. There is no notification led. And unfortunately, despite the oled, there isn't even a portion of the screen that is always active with notifications. In the "" horns "" (as I love to call them) there would have been great. Powerful stereo speaker! One below and the other in the capsule. But what surprised me is the faceID. Precise, punctual, extremely reliable. In any situation of use. I dare say more comfortable than touchID. And Apple confirms itself as the queen of optimization. Unblocking with the face is not new, but it has never worked so well on any other terminal I tried. Night, day, sun, lamps, darkness. Always works. And if left on a desk it works with a good angle of face positioning with respect to the perpendicular, let's say a good 20th. Beautiful, very beautiful display. And the brightest measured so far. Over 1000 lux horizontally, peak 1300. True tone that I like, makes the colors warmer and contextualized and colors very faithful. Ok, white turns slightly to blue compared to perpendicular but nothing to do with the Pixel 2 XL. The brightness sensor is also excellent. Processor and memory. The A11 bionic is very powerful. The ram on iOs counts less than Android and here we have 3gb. 64 or 256 the two available memory cuts. Photos and videos. Essentially similar to iPhone 8 plus. Although similar to the downside. He suffers a little more in low light. But, thanks to the depth sensor, he succeeds in the portrait and AR effects even with the anterior chamber. The videos are at the top as usual. And for stabilization, and for quality and resolution. Very full stereo sound even with integrated speakers. Sounds great even with headphones .... but need the adapter.	1
I was a bit skeptical about buying an object of so much value via amazon, but I changed my mind, everything went very well with timely delivery as expected. On the phone what to say, is what I expected, I have always used apple passing from the various iphone, of course coming from an iphone 6 the difference is noticeable and as above all in the battery life	1
iPhone X, very fast phone, very efficient, battery that lasts so much respect you have previous iPhone. Very elegant, beautiful and very vivid screen colors, the right size screen, what about and in my opinion the best iPhone on the market.	1
There is little to really say, there are reviews made very well so I won't dwell too much. Until now I have been owner of Android phones, but I decided to switch to iOS for practical reasons and also to change a little air. The phone is made with extremely good materials and the Silver color gives much elegance and refinement compared to the black, definitely more sporty. With the guarantee of Amazon then it is another story, even better to buy it in an Apple Store. Top!	1
"Excellent value for money" cannot be said ... the price of the iphone is objectively very high, however their products are unique so there is no way to compare them. They cost little to do. Battery in line with expectations, at the end of the day it needs to be recharged to face the following day in safety. Waterproofness ... I don't know, I don't want to try: I export perfectly from iCloud, faceId very beautiful and innovative , working even in the absence of light.	1
I went from an iPhone 6S to an iPhone X. There isn't much of a difference: the display is a little bigger but you don't notice much. Unfortunately, the notch is really horrendous, well, so to speak. The photos, however, are much better, much more defined. Even in facetime or similar calls, greater clarity is noted. After all, I took it to take good pictures (I have a travel blog) and so I'm satisfied! PS Even the battery seems to me to be harder.	1
I was a bit skeptical at first, fearing there was some hidden problem. Instead everything was perfect. I got an iPhone x 256Gb, arrived a few days ago. Original packaging, intact, perfect. Phone and new accessories in perfect condition. Exactly identical to the Apple Store purchase. The phone works perfectly. Recommended.	1
Step up from an iPhone 6s, so the difference is obvious, but I'm super super happy with this investment! EXCELLENT APPLE PRODUCT, ARRIVED IN AGREED TIME AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. Maniacally packaged.	1
EXCELLENT APPLE PRODUCT, ARRIVED IN AGREED TIME AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. Maniacally packaged and the product is an apple hit for me	1
Nothing to add, like all apple products, is perfect, well packaged and everything	1
Great, the best iPhone I have ever had highly recommended	1
New, flawless product, those who know don't need reviews, it's an iPhone X! Point! Perfect! As for the package shipping ok, in fact, arrived even earlier than expected!	1
Exceptional product: so far it has fully met my expectations. Punctual delivery and intact packaging.	1
GREAT	1
All right	1
Usually I don't like to write reviews on the purchase products, but this time I felt the need because the product arrived in a very punctual way (less than a day) and as described and in stark contrast to what happened to another user (received a bottle of water instead of an iphone!).	1
bought after selling mine you do to say iphone 7 plus, this iphone X is really beautiful, powerful, beautiful aesthetics, infinite battery life coming from a 7 plus .. who finds defects in this product has no reason to do so !! ! the top !!!!!	1
all right, as described. great price, it's the second one I have, the first one taken directly from vodafone but there is no difference, everything is perfect, very fast shipping	1
Great product, arrived earlier than expected! even if reconditioned and, as specified, with some scratches, it was in excellent condition practically like new!	1
Guys, this is the first time I have dared to buy an Apple product and I must say that I am more than satisfied, I have always had Nokia even when it became Microsoft but I must say that they cannot be compared at all, the iPhone is of a another level of technology, so, without stretching too far, believe me when I tell you that it was absolutely worth making such a sacrifice, especially this X in my opinion is simply the best. It is already a month that I have it and it works wonderfully, no defects for my tastes and my needs, if you have the chance take it immediately!	1
Arrived on time perfect iPhone	1
Fantastic	1
Cost in my opinion really too high. IOS is another thing, higher level than a lot	1
Very satisfied with the purchase ... my iPhone X was delivered to me the next day ... unopened package ... Apple is a guarantee	1
The product now knows, at the purchase price below € 800 I consider it a good purchase, nothing to complain as always about Apple products	1
On the phone of course nothing to say. I know or have used rivers of bits and pixels for reviews from people far more titled than me. Amazon a certainty, arrived after two days in a perfect way.	1
Repurchased for the second time. Excellent quality / price ratio. Sold and sent by Amazon for just under 800 euros. The product is new, without brand with 24 months warranty.	1
really a great retailer. I will certainly make other purchases. very available	1
Sold and sent by Amazon, a guarantee not to be underestimated! The only flaw is the fact that on the invoice there is NO reference to the serial number of the phone that comes. The product is however new and to be activated, so it is possible to carry out the Apple care in a second time from the dedicated Apple site	1
is the fourth iphone I buy, and I believe it won't even be the last. The transition from the 6s is felt, both in terms of speed and in quality of the shots. All purchased at a really interesting price. 5 stars deserved	1
Beyond the product itself (Apple is a guarantee of quality) the smartphone is original. I have been using it for 3 months and I am by god. I was a bit skeptical about switching to iphone but damn that time I didn't do it before! Also recommended as a price here on amazon.	1
Original product arrived on time. Original box with original battery charger and headphones. I RECOMMEND this purchase! I found myself very well.	1
I bought it for a gift, sold and sent by Amazon for the price of 599.99. To be as safe and quiet as possible with the guarantee. It arrived 1 day earlier than expected, packed perfectly. I have one too and I've been using it for about 5 months, and it's very comfortable. The only drawback, however, if you stress so much is the battery. For the rest super recommended. Particularly if sold and shipped by Amazon.	1
Purchased by Maritel srl, perfect phone with European guarantee, the booklet is written in Croatian I think .. but ok the language is set at the first power on, works perfectly and in the package there was the invoice for the warranty 12 months Apple and subsequent 12 from the seller, what to say I am satisfied given the recent rip-off that I took on eBay ... Amazon a guarantee!	1
First iPhone that I buy, I was a little afraid of buying online given the amount and fortunately I changed my mind. Delivery times respected, packaging well done and arrived in excellent condition. All original and closed. Very satisfied. It's located abroad but I expected it after reading the other reviews, but it doesn't create any kind of problem.	1
Great product we are talking about an iPhone on the other hand and it corresponds perfectly to that described ... the package arrived in perfect condition ... the delivery was scheduled from 5 to 9 July while already the afternoon of 4 July had been delivered .. .else also the seller in the reply of the email to my invoice request ...	1
I'm really happy with the purchase. Let's start from the price that is at the time of my purchase was one of the lowest in Italy. The seller, Digitech, very serious and professional, packed the device well and provided the track number. Iphone 8 confirms the standards of the Apple brand. Currently I can't add anything else because I've been using it for a few hours. The first impression is certainly positive.	1
According to the iphone I buy, my first was the 6 and I must say that it is always a certainty, it always works very well, easy to use and I wouldn't go back to android even under torture!	1
In the meantime, I thank amazon for assisting me in dealing with a problem on the price change at the time of booking, exceptionally solved in my favor in fairly tight times. The only problem has always been the battery, which during the day forced me to recharge at least once. Problem solved finally with this model, which currently manages to hold up peacefully all day and even a little more. It is also the last one left with the 3D touch, a function that I have always found very convenient and that unfortunately in the new models will be eliminated apparently. Excellent audio, splendid camera, fast and responsive in the passage between apps also direct. For those who are comfortable with iOS it is quite advisable, but I would not make a jump from 6s to 7 except for the battery issue.	1
It has always been my best purchase on Amazon ... the phone I paid much less than I could pay at the official store. It is also the best iPhone in my opinion if I consider the convenience in handling it with just one handThe advice	1
I purchased this iPhone 8, which arrived in perfect condition, to replace my iPhone 5S, whose battery had begun to experience particular charging problems after 3 years. 4 stars at battery life because this phone being new holds the charge perfectly and does not create any problems. iPhone is in my opinion the best phone, as graphics and comfort. Despite everything, I recommend it.	1
I immediately want to clarify the fast and impeccable service of the seller, I do not add anything else since it is an iphone but it is a phone that I gave and loved, it is very fast and makes extraordinary photos. Highly recommended	1
Arrived perfectly, too bad it's not prime! The product arrived well packed and on schedule, on the phone there's nothing to say ... iPhone ... beautiful (all in glass and the gold version, slightly pink) ... but the phone is really nice!	1
Very fast and perfect shipping. The article ... what should I tell you? It's an iPhone 8 in all its beauty. A jewel of technology. The best purchase I've ever made!	1
I bought this Apple IPhone 8 Silver for my girlfriend and it is a really excellent phone that has nothing to envy from other phones. Try it for yourself	1
The shipment was lightning, delivered a day earlier than expected, with quick shipping via Prime account. The object is presented in its original box, with the characteristic Apple film, a sign that it should not be a return or a reconditioned at all.	1
item arrived early, in original packaging verified as original apple.operating product, all in place even if it does not differ much from 7 comes with some improvements especially in the camera part.	1
Purchased over the weekend and arrived before the set period. Excellent product and excellent shipping. Even in my case the instruction booklet was not in Italian, but it does not appear to be a problem as the language can be selected when the phone is switched on.	1
It's the maximum. It makes excellent photos, videos and has unimaginable functions. He arrived super protected, earlier than expected and as seen in the picture.	1
Delivered in less than 48 hours. Product absolutely new and complete with all the accessories. With an upgrade to iOS 12 the battery life increases up to levels never seen before on an iPhone.	1
There is little to say, it is an iPhone and only this is synonymous with quality. The price is very good compared to the store price, surely it is better to buy it here than in an Apple center.	1
I am very satisfied with this phone. I have been using the iPhone since 2010 and I haven't changed genre anymore. This is the third iPhone I change. I had the 3GS, then the 5 and finally the 8.	1
Iphone is not discussed, it has always been a phone easy to use compared to the competition. It's intuitive. simple.	1

Great the day after my order has already arrived 800 km of travel. Product as per catalog sealed in the original box all perfect Congratulations	1
Obvious! a great phone! Scary camera, the new processor optimally and performs the phone, really good in gold!	1
Product arrived in perfect condition and without delay, including original accessories and adapter for the jack. Great price for being an iPhone. Nothing to claim	1
The delivery service was punctual. The price is great, after three months I didn't see any problems. The box in the back had Cyrillic writing, but when it is turned on the Italian language comes out immediately, so no problem. I contacted the seller to get information about any guarantee in case of problems and they responded immediately. Fully satisfied	1
The product arrived in excellent condition in its original packaging, equipped with a jack adapter, headphones and charger with Italian plug, fully functional. The phone and accessories are all original and have no defects. Given the considerable savings I highly recommend buying the product. The expedition also complied with the scheduled deadlines.	1
After using the iPhone for a consecutive month, I can confirm that I made a good purchase. The phone arrived 3 days after the order, it comes in its original packaging, inside a second box, with all its original accessories and invoice. Furthermore the Cellularishop seller was extremely available for any questions and clarifications. 100% reliability, vote 10.	1
What to say! At first, given the price, I was hesitant. I read the reviews carefully and given the reliability I decided to buy it. I am very satisfied. It arrived quickly, in its original Apple case, complete with billing. What to say. Highly recommended.	1
I have been using the smartphone for a few days and I am fine. The screen is gorgeous and the battery with normal use lasts for a day and a half. The operating system is fluid and the camera makes beautiful shots even in low light conditions. I am very satisfied with the purchase and I recommend it to everyone.	1
The item arrived two days after the purchase, therefore before the date indicated by Amazon and the seller was very helpful when I heard it by phone. The phone arrived very well packed and in the original box, intact without dents. gold color is really beautiful, it looks more like a gold rose than a classic gold that is golden, I would say that it is more prone to powder as a coloring. Very nice phone, I recommend the purchase of the iPhone 8 and also the seller who was impeccable.	1
Superb !! I went from an iPhone 5 to 8 and what to say, a whole other world! I relied on positive reviews and I did well, all this money is worth, indeed it's a bargain compared to the original price! Perfectly working and also the color is really beautiful, it is not a gaudy gold that I imagined but colored powder. One month after the purchase I can say that I am really satisfied!	1
Product arrived in perfect condition and without delay, purchased from neophonia. Including original charger, warranty and jack cable adapter. Nothing to claim.	1
The product arrived 3 days before the date fixed and here the company has earned 1 extra starlet !!! The casing was perfect as well as the product. For me it was a VERY POSITIVE experience. Surely if I need to do other purchases I will keep this company in consideration and will recommend it to my friends	1
I'm writing from the device bought, and it's perfect in everything !!! Perfect apple accessories, intact box and the famous plastic of the new product in its place (with great satisfaction in removing it). Unique flaw in manual not in Italian.	1
Punctual shipping, well packaged and adherent to expectations. Nothing to complain. Complete with accessories: charger, headphones, European warranty. Definitely a good buy.	1
The phone arrived on schedule and that is 1 day from the order date. No packaging was planned, but everything arrived intact and fully functional. Italian charger, only the packaging was in a foreign language, however it is all original Apple. There was no invoice attached, but the purchase on Amazon is still authentic. I have been using the iPhone for a few days and so far I have not found any anomalies. Needless to say, the quality of the chosen product respects the expectations I had. 5 stars especially for the absolutely affordable price.	1
The iphone has arrived sealed in its box, no sign of opening is perfectly working the product is excellent, the seller was impeccable excellent communication has followed the whole shipping phase by sending me emails and updating me on the position, perfect times and respected the first day on the three indicated by amazon, what to say advice to all this seller !!!!	1
I purchased this iPhone 8 from the digital realm, I was a bit dubious about buying an expensive phone online! ... arrived the next day original phone perfect product! ... thanks to the seller	1
Great product. I've been using it for almost a week and it works fine! It arrived even earlier than expected! I also asked the seller a question and he responded very quickly! Council	1
Expedited speed, the phone has arrived perfectly packed at my home. Until today it has worked perfectly and I am fully satisfied, as I was, previously bought.	1
Product arrived in a few days and corresponds exactly to the initial description. I had never bought products over 100/150 € with Amazon, I had doubts, but I tried anyway. I can be 100% satisfied	1
Very happy with this purchase. Perfect, new, Italian battery charger, just like if I bought it at the Apple Store. I arrived in 4 days. 5 stars!	1
Fast shipment and tip, perfect product, packaging ok, I am very happy to have purchased this product, the transition to iOS was not at all traumatic ... indeed ...	1
excellent product, fast and reliable. delivery made in advance of the stated times. improved touch id compared to previous versions. the objectives are certainly not the pride of the iphone but it is certainly not the purpose of these products.	1
Product arrived perfectly in time, on the reliability of the product I had no doubts for me there exists only the iPhone. Very kind dealer, I requested the invoice and after one day the one also arrived. Fully satisfied	1
Original product arrived two days in advance. Original box with battery charger and headphones inside. Bought by CELLULARISHOP. I requested an invoice and it was sent to me correctly.	1
I bought the phone for my partner. Initially I was a little skeptical of buying such a "" challenging "" product in this way but ..... Amazon and its partners never disappoint and I received the phone in perfect working order, with its original and sealed box and packaging. After some time the phone is perfect! Highly recommended as well as great savings!	1
Fantastic phone, beautiful, modern ... Maybe a little inconvenient because you don't have a headphone jack and sometimes have slowdowns. Except this, it's a convenient and fast phone with a lot of autonomy (which I appreciate from a former android user) .The package has the Cyrillic writing on the back, but the phone works perfectly even with Italian operators. Also included are all the accessories and namely Earpods, lightning-jack adapter, charger and pin for sim.Insomma, recommended purchase!	1
Step up from an iPhone 6 and the changes are very few but noticeable, I do not need the change from one to the other but I recommend it to those who are in possession of older mobile phones. Excellent Amazon service	1
A very fast and fluid improved version, too bad for just two gigabytes of ram, but I recommend buying also for the price	1
Purchase highly recommended to anyone! He arrived a day earlier than the scheduled date (purchased on December 25th, delivered on the 28th). Unbeatable price, well sealed package and Italian charger. I would say that better than that I could not ask!	1
the phone is fast and efficient. excellent battery life. camera okay did not disappoint. purchase to recommend	1
Arrived on time of delivery, and with relative invoice. Excellent packaging. All original. The battery charger has an Italian socket. Bought from Digital Kingdom. I recommend it, given the savings!	1
What can I say, I have never made such a large purchase on amazon but I was sure because I have been buying it for a lifetime. Phone arrived a day before scheduled delivery, obviously intact and perfectly sealed inside a sturdy cardboard box. As for the phone, you will not find a price for a Iphone 8 just released. Step from a 5s and the configuration was simple and fast. Just combine the two iPhones and all the old data will be transferred to the new one (whatsap chat, all the photos, all the installed apps, wifi passwords, ringtones etc. .. EVEN THE EMOTICON YOU USE!). It does not seem to have changed the phone. In conclusion a Mr. phone as I expected, an exceptional camera that makes videos in 4k 60fps, very fast in multytasking like any iphone, exceptional colors with intelligent brightness that adjusts based on ambient lighting, amazing audio, you can even hear the bass. The design really a strong point, like every year, of Apple; curved screen on the sides, metal frame and the back is composed of a glass that is comfortable to touch and non-slip. I still recommend a cover as it is a high-end phone. The last feature I want to highlight is wireless charging; I bought a phone together with the phone to recharge the phone by simply placing the phone on it, because even Apple has decided to enter this mode. For this, I recommend buying a cover suitable for wireless charging (if interested). Summing it all up a great deal of buying for me that I don't often change phones but that when I do I choose the top. In my opinion, money well spent. Great Amazon as usual!	1
The phone is great in every detail, unfortunately the shipping was slow and that's why I didn't put 5 stars. Anyway the mobile is a fairy tale!	1
Original article, perfectly packaged with accessories included. Timed delivery, AMAZON Prime. Amazon guarantee, which is how much to say. It was a very welcome gift to my wife.	1
Arrived 3 days late but it was worth it. Original new product in sealed package. On the model nothing to say, Apple is more than a guarantee.	1
The seller was perfect in the delivery. The package was intact the content exactly as described. The phone works perfectly	1
It's not the latest model, but the more than honest price made me decide to buy. The phone is new and works great	1
Great price as usual on Amazon. It was a gift and those who received it were very happy. Great beautiful photos!	1
Excellent phone, delivered two days after the order. Very helpful and reliable seller. All original. I highly recommend it	1
Apple products always up to expectations. Delivery on time and also received an invoice as soon as requested	1
Give me phone4s at 8 other ... always iPhone	1
perfect transaction in all respects	1
but is it single sim? can i use the sim that i had or should i make myself do one that is suitable for iPhone?	1
At first I was skeptical, but everything went well .... reliable seller.	1
I was skeptical instead I had to change my mind! New original and working telephone	1
Great cell phone! Perfect purchase unparalleled value for money!	1
Great product	1
Great product	1
IPHONE 8 original and new, still in its original packaging, conforming to the description. I arrive from the 5S model and 16GB of memory, now insufficient with continuous updates and various applications, but with this 64GB model, I solved my problems and I must say that it is also faster, not counting the resolution of the camera, and of images, satisfied with my purchase.	1
I bought two iPhone 8s within a few months, one for me and one for a family member. Always purchased by Regno Digitale. Great price, punctual delivery, new and working cell phones. Great experience.	1
Like any impeccable Apple product! Given to my daughter and she finds it fast and with a much more precise camera than her old Iphone 6. Sold and sent by Amazon, fast and early delivery than expected! Another nice note and not trivial, I put it in the cart and when I went to confirm it was discounted by 100 euros, since they were the last three, as soon as I bought it they were sold out!	1
Perfect timing and delivery. Regarding the product, I had the 4s and the transition to 8 is very good: similar configurations, only much faster. In conclusion, nothing to say, no problem.	1
I waited 6 months to review. The phone is perfect, beautiful, it is an iPhone 8 in short with everything it needs to have. Fast shipping even if when I saw what courier was entrusted I was afraid they would lose it. In fact, I arrived on Wednesday and on Friday from tracking to delivery was still traveling ...........	1
New iPhone, sealed, all packed, I really changed my mind, at first I was a bit skeptical, but when I opened the package I was astonished, recommended!	1
The first thing, the most important: a new product arrives, packed, corresponding to the description and arrives quickly. If I need phone products again in the future I think I will consider this seller. This is an iPhone 8, a well-known product, so I won't spend time talking about the phone itself.	1
I gladly write a review because I found myself very well with this purchase. The product is absolutely original at a price without competitors. The seller is serissino, he responded very quickly to my questions and delivered the product in plenty of time before what was declared at the time of purchase.	1
Iphone 8 Rose Gold 64gb, arrived a day early, packed and sealed perfectly. Present invoice from the shop (Digital Kingdom). Great, even for the price (622 euros)	1
It's the third iPhone I buy, but this one beats all of them! Delivery on time, too bad that it is by mail .. I was a little worried but it went wellBetter battery The phone is terrific !!	1
I PURCHASED THIS MOBILE PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS REMAINED ENOUGH: SUPER FAST CONNECTION, GREAT MEMORY, PHOTO ALMOST RESOLUTION PROFESSIONAL, FUN, PRACTICAL, INTUITIVE SCREENS.	1
New phone, arrived after 3 days well sealed with charger and earphones. The iPhone quality speaks for itself .. For now I am very satisfied with the purchase having certainly saved compared to the shops.	1
Bought less than the list price, flash offer, I received my iPhone 8 in original Apple packaging, also all original accessories. I admit I was a bit skeptical given the unexpected discount (already disappeared among other things) but I'm fully satisfied! Beautiful Amazon made me equal	1
Arrived on schedule works perfectly and cost an adequate amount! Obviously it is new and is very beautiful Eye to males that "gold" is a little bit on the rosé ;-)	1
The phone arrived earlier than expected, it is new and well appointed. I bought it for a gift and now it is 15 days that it is used without ever having a problem.	1
Great smartphone, up to expectations. High-end product at the right price, excellent photography, excellent sound, wireless headphones.	1
Great phone perfect in everything, Before I had a 6 plus and in comparison it is much faster. I advise . great phone	1
Parcel delivered in advance with Amazon Prime. Iphone8 64Gb white new sealed. Great price I recommend	1
Excellent, working, always at the top. Everything perfect and in order. Offer (at the time) at the top	1
Apple does not deny it. No doubt about the quality of the product. Perfect.	1
If you want a really quality phone, you need to choose iPhone!	1
The lowest price on the web	1
Amazon super reliable: arrived as described, new and sealed. Promotion with a very affordable price!	1
Seller ok! Great product, like all Apple products!	1
product true to the description. Amazon always impeccable	1
Perfect	1
Beautiful and fully functional. It was a great buy at a good price. I can say I'm happy and fully satisfied. I advise.	1
I bought the phone as a gift for my daughter and the product is perfect, flawless packaging. What surprised me pleasantly is the seriousness of the seller who (as I had read in other reviews) sent me the telephone I ordered 3 days in advance if I had to buy other products that are part of the 'Digital Kingdom' catalog, certainly the purchase I will do it from them ... the seriousness and the correctness today is rare and where it is there it must be rewarded	1
Perfect in everything	1
Very fast shipping. The smartphone comes in original and sealed packaging. Regarding the iPhone, it is very nice and the processor is the same as the X model. I chose 8 because it has the traditional design. All perfect!	1
Arrived a day early .. it is the first time I make such a big expense on the internet in fact I was a bit doubtful but I changed my mind .. they are very professional they answered all my emails and there were no problems	1
An improved version of the iPhone 7, coming from the iPhone 6, there isn't even a very fast and fluid comparison, shame about the only two gigabytes of ram, but I recommend the purchase also for the price	1
Fast shipping, great price, arrived well packed and with all the accessories in its packaging. For the doubters it is "" All original "". Taken for my girlfriend in this color (Gold) which looks like a powder pink, very nice to see especially the glass back. Reliable seller.	1
Original product of Italian origin with accessories as per the Apple catalog. Fully functional, it did not detect any installation problems. Still well performing, it is a high level product suitable for a competent public that knows how to appreciate even the smallest differences. Definitely advisable.	1
I've only had it for a month, but I'm satisfied with this phone. I have to get used to it, coming from a completely different phone, but I like it a lot. Light, big screen, elegant, the battery lasts for 2 days with a normal use of some photos, various e-mails and messaging, use of different apps. Bluetooth does not affect battery consumption too much, like in the Windows phone I had before.	1
Higher quality product, those who switch to the Phone no longer come back for the qualities of the smartphone and for the incomparable technology.	1
I purchased this garden irrigation system because having a green thumb I could not miss a product that would automatically water the plants with just a tap opening! I bought it because with a practically negligible price it really allowed me to water my whole planter ... A lot of components, great to easily create an irrigation plant for vegetable gardens and flower beds, I use it for my strawberry plants. The installation is very simple and customizable and not very intrusive, so great for those who once harvested the product must work the land for another different sowing, in 5 minutes remove everything and in 10 repaint with another setting. It can be installed in two ways to have the possibility to irrigate several vessels in separate ducts, saving time for watering. The kit arrives complete as per insertion and c in very short time. really a great buy.	1
What about ... It's an iPhone. Very smooth, very fast, very good color reception has been improved, an exceptional camera. The only flaw in my opinion compared to its size is a bit heavy compared to other smartphones. I had doubts about the life of the battery, vanished immediately after a day of use, it arrives perfectly at the end of the day while stressing Massimo.	1
I was very hesitant to buy an item of such important value online. Then read the reviews I decided to buy. In fact the item arrived in a sealed box. It works well, delivery was made one day earlier than expected; there was a lot of savings. I can hardly say but: everything is perfect!	1
I obviously found myself very well, but having had iPhone 4s and 6 before this 8, it couldn't be that way. Delivery was fast and ... I don't think there is anything else to add. Excellent Apple support, of which unfortunately I needed because my phone had a problem. I was replaced with a new one, but I already had this confirmed. Apple even if it costs more, from this point of view it is a guarantee.	1
iphone is always a great choice, versatile and complete; in the case of the SE model also compact and handy. I use it mainly for phone calls and / or watsapp, but it's also convenient for the internet. great product! super recommended. With Amazon all o.k.	1
Arrived only two days after the purchase, even before the estimated delivery date. With the tracking code of the package provided by them, just go to the courier's website and you can immediately see how far they are. The product inside the package (in its original box with all intact Apple seals) was well packaged in a box filled with polystyrene to keep it away from bumps and shocks and with the stickers that they claimed to handle it with care. The product is the original and has no flaws. Much more than satisfied! Very good seller! In addition, the 64gb iPhone 8 I bought sells it at a lower price than the one offered in the apple store. If I need after sales support we will see, but as they were in the sale I would say fantastic!	1
I love this product, I have always been a lover of iPhones and as usual the site is very reliable, it allows us to have a technologically advanced product at a reasonable price. Council	1
iPhone 8? Three things: charging, grip and sound from the speakers. Which are not really aspects of the smartphone, but features added to the macro-features that already exist: autonomous charging, design grip and multimedia audio. There would be a little drawing to do, so simple to explain. IPhone 8, nice but always the same design since 2015iPhone 8, beautiful but still the same design since 20151. Top-up (wireless) I put wireless charging first because it's the only feature I'm already missing. It seems stupid and of little use, but having a support base on which to instantly load your smartphone is not foolish. For the occasion, I bought a recharge base on Amazon for € 9.99, which I placed on my bedside table in the bedroom. I don't know if it makes sense to take this base on the road, because it would only be something more to carry that would not give a real added value, compared to the normal USB-Lightning cable. I noticed that, with a cable, the iPhone 8 recharges 100% in about 1 hour, and with wireless charging in just under 2, but with the latter method the glass body behind warms up considerably. If it heats up in this period that the outside temperature is at maximum 28 degrees, I can only imagine what could happen in the summer with 40 degrees and more. In any case, wireless charging is very useful, especially since Apple has decided not to create its own standard, but to use the Qi standard which is very widespread.Grip, better with the iPhone 8 backside, grip is better with the shell rear in iPhone 8 glass, the grip is better with the rear body in glass I am trying out iPhone 8 while I look at that frying pan of the iPhone 7 Plus that I bought last year and which now seems terribly inefficient in terms of size. It almost seems that today, after all these models of smartphones with FullVision displays, InfinityDisplay and so on and so forth, "going back" to a smartphone with even a few millimeters of edges is like being back in 2003. As I have already written in the Galaxy S8 review, iPhone 7 Plus looks ugly and old to me. iPhone 8 has the exact same form factor as its predecessor, yet the rear glass body removes a bit of bitterness in the mouth. It is not just a matter of appearance: iPhoneItalia dear Andrea Cervone recently released a video on Youtube which clearly shows that glass resists all kinds of falls, and only yields to absurd falls - like those from a balcony.iPhone 8 doesn't seem to break even if you kick it and hit it against a tree. Seeing is believing. I obviously haven't tried it. Last, but not least, is the audio: it seems that many producers have made up their minds to turn their laptop and smartphone into speakers, because even iPhone 8 earns a good percentage more decibels, if we can say so. The volume is higher than the previous ones and the Galaxy S8, and it's really clean. Yes, it could be a reason to switch to iPhone 8, but not for me for example. And then? IPhone 8 actually has changes under the shell. But they are not very relevant. There is the new A11 Bionic chip, which has a dedicated processor for machine learning (but now is of little use), there is also a renewed camera that takes photos and shoots videos 2% better than the iPhone 7. And on iPhone 8 Plus there is the dual camera with which you can use Portrait Lighting, a mode that acts in real time on the portrait and highlights it, or puts it in black and white, and so on. For now, though, they're all games, the real applications that can take advantage of the A11 Bionic chip are still work in progress. I have said that neither iPhone 8 nor iPhone X are the real news from Apple, because Apple's direction is on reality (increased) - even Valentino, in his article, delves into augmented reality and the iPhone. In short, iPhone 8 is a small step forward, because one step was necessary to do so. Of course, 50% of iPhone users are waiting for the iPhone X because it is the most expensive smartphone for consumers in history (I don't count special editions and luxury smartphones). So, in a nutshell: if you come from iPhone 6 or earlier, iPhone 8 will be a big step forward. Otherwise, go ahead: the revolution has yet to come.	1
Great gift for my daughter, that was what we expected	1
New product, perfectly packed and corresponding to the description. Paid considerably less than in the store, highly recommended!	1
Waiting for the new generation IPhone SE (hoping to come out) is the top in terms of handling and pleasure of use	1
The phone is brand new, Italian too. Perfect from all points of view.	1
Great	1
In truth, I bought the phone for a friend who wanted to make a gift. Perfect item with fast shipping. For the rest, very little to say, iPhon is a certainty in terms of quality ... the rest? Either you hate it or you love it !!	1
Excellent in all respects!	1
A mobile phone that already has the same one, I made a gift, and whoever received it is very happy, even the affordable price, as usual with Amazon I never wrong, thanks!	1
Purchased at Christmas with an offer (sold and sent by Amazon) for 548 euros ... very welcome gift result. Excellent performance and great price. Article as described.	1
I purchased this iPhone 8 gold as a gift for my daughter, who was enthusiastic about it. In terms of aesthetics, it is very beautiful, compared to my Samsung S9 it is obviously more robust and more protected than the screen. Very easy to install with a special app to download everything as installed on the Android phone he had before. Very high photo quality, good sound. The only negative points in my opinion are the locked memory (it is not possible to insert additional memory cards, this is a half scam to draw money) and the price really too high to be already over 2 years old.	1
Aesthetically beautiful, the rear glass allows an excellent grip even though the smartphone is rather large in size. Ultra-finished LCD screen, true tone really makes the difference. Photo in portrait mode is really good with the possibility of editing before shooting. 8 plus from a 7 plus is not convenient, in all other cases I recommend it. For myself it is better than X, both for reliability (product already tested and with functionality similar to the cousin greater) and for the price much more affordable .	1
The iPhone 8 Plus, I think it's the best smartphone on the market. The product has endless and excellent capabilities and meets my expectations in full. I will be delighted to use it for a long time.	1
I made the transition from iPhone 6 to iPhone 8 Plus because the performance and speed of the previous one had become really questionable. With the 8 Plus everything is perfect, the speed is excellent, the performance and autonomy are ideal, obviously the last sti stabilizes after a few days of use when the system recognizes your average usage. Visually, the iPhone 8 is really big but it looks good in the hand, obviously with a good cover, otherwise it slips. The back is now made of glass, which on the one hand is very nice to look at, but on the other hand a potential weak spot and repair of the glass are the risks. Apple uses the A11 Bionic chip on the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which puts all the other opponents in the shade.- the camera is probably one of the highlights of the new IPhone 8 Plus. It has a dual 12 MP camera and a 7 MP front camera. Here it is really very possible. The 4K recordings, the vertical mode and the live photos are some keywords. - Touch ID is back on board, this will no longer be the case with the iPhone X. For me, this was a reason not to take the iPhone X, but rather the 8 Plus, since I'm so used to the Touch ID.- the battery should, according to the manufacturer, similar to the 7 Plus, allow about 21 hours of talk time, up to 13 hours of Internet use, 14 hours of video playback and 60 hours of audio playback. Of course, I didn't do these tests in practice, but I can say that the battery lasts all day, I leave the house at 7 in the morning, and when I go to bed in the evening at 11 pm, I still have between 15% and 25% battery .- with iOS 11 already installed, the command center has been reworked and you can configure it yourself. I consider it a great advantage because I can choose what I need and what I don't do. - the screen and the back are covered with an anti-grease layer that makes fingerprints less evident. Compared to the Galaxy S8 of my girlfriend, I can even confirm it.- for me it is a disadvantage that Apple renounces the iPhone 7 and now the 8 on the jack connection. I use my iPhone while driving a car as a navigation device and I also listen to music via iPhone. With my 6 series, I was able to connect the AUX cable and charge the device at the same time. This is now possible only through special accessories, for which you must also spend money again. - the quick charge function on the iPhone 8 is also accessible only if you are ready to spend another 90 ¬ vouchers for the power supply and the charging cable Concluding, I can say that I do not regret at all the leap in quality because we notice how old my iPhone 6 has become. I am very enthusiastic about the speed of my new 8 Plus and the autonomy of its battery compared to my previous phone.	1
As always, iPhone is a guarantee, I come from a 6s plus and I must say that despite the aesthetics is practically the same internally it is much faster in daily use, record-breaking battery life virtually endless! Wireless charging compatible with other non-Apple devices which to say absolutely recommended !!	1
product arrived a day in advance (even if it is to wait two weeks) the phone comes in its original box complete with accessories. for the moment all is well done congratulations to Digitech P.	1
Fantastic phone, I have been using it for just over a week and I must say, being my first iPhone, that Apple quality can be seen! I ordered it through Digitech P, delivery times respected (you have to wait a little longer than others, but for the value for money it is absolutely worth it), and moreover full availability of the seller: there had been a communication error in the shipping tracking code, and he promptly contacted me within a few hours of my request of information, communicating to me the new one; in short, everything perfect	1
I purchased my iPhone 8 plus for € 200 less than the original price! Shipping a little too long, but it's worth it.	1
Excellent new sealed product, I have been using it for 2 months at the moment it has given me no problem, I recommend it.	1
Tested for a month, great phone, the extra mememoria is heard in case it is used very frequently to keep documents and apps related to work, actually the dimensions are quite important for a phone however for my personal taste and size of hands it's perfect, great buy, recommended.	1
Arrived today, perfect. As if it had been bought in the shop. Well packed and protected, absolutely original Apple. As for the phone itself, it is wonderful. It promises well. Inside the box is everything you would find in the store , ie phone, headphones and charger. Beautiful phone	1
The phone is a bomb, it works great and takes very nice pictures. Furthermore, having 256GB is exceptional. Parcel delivered with long times, but we already knew.	1
What to say. Excellent quality of customer service and courtesy shown. The product is absolutely compliant with the request and the price is very competitive compared to competitors. Almost, I buy another one.	1
Recommended product! I didn't have any problems. I arrived in 3 working days and with traceable shipping! Needless to review the product, speak for itself. Amazing in every part!	1
It seems to have no guarantee. Opening with Cyrillic characters. However it works perfectly, apart from the home button that has no click	1
Fantastic phone I am really happy with the purchase intact and original packed I will never go back crazy size screaming camera	1
Arrived in two days packed in its original box and all worked out! I had no problems so I recommend	1
fast delivery . The product speaks for itself	1
There is not much to say about apple products, they are machines that work great! I bought online because of the price that was unbeatable in that period and it went very well for me	1
Great product as always ..	1
iPhone 8 Plus arrived punctual, complete with everything and working perfectly. The expected delivery period was from 7 to 19 September and the delivery took place on the 14th. When I ordered it I was a little suspicious and instead everything went very well. I also contacted the seller several times by e-mail and whatsapp and he immediately responded with the utmost availability and professionalism. I recommend buying this product at Digitech P.	1
the article meets all expectations. The delivery was quick. I am happy with the purchase	1
I received the excellent product works well now I'm waiting for the invoice to keep it as a guarantee thanks	1
Correct user in perfect mobile delivery.	1
Great phone	1
Very kind seller and perfect product	1
Arrived immediately	1
Very good in perfect condition and arrived fast thanks	1
Perfect	1
Great	1
iPhone 8 Plus the best	1
I like everything	1
Perfect phone. Shipping from shit GLS is better than changing jobs. Very very friendly retailer. I expect the invoices of both phones both iPhone 8 plus and iPhone 7 (sent to the same address but bought by my wife then in her name) I hope they will arrive soon.	1
Lightning-fast delivery, ordered late Saturday evening, received the following Monday in the morning. In original Apple packaging in perfect condition. On the product I think there is little to comment, it is my fourth iPhone and the feeling it gave me since the first contact is that it is the best phone ever tried. Five stars for service and retailer, I saved € 200 compared to the standard price.	1
Since there are buffaloes around everybody especially on smartphones, I had serious doubts, then once I got checked, etc. I absolutely have to congratulate the seller Cheri + that OTTIMOFIDATEVICiao a Tutti Buoni	1
After so much hesitation I decided to buy the phone from amazon. Arrived after two days, packed to perfection with warranty seal. The phone is new and contains earphones and chargers, nothing to say! I saved about € 200 given the prices around. I will recommend it to everyone. THE PHONE OBVIOUSLY IS A BOMB! 5 stars are not enough.	1
I loved my purchase my iphone 8 plus it took a little longer but it was worth it I arrived without a flaw all original I recommend the seller I realized the delay arrived 4 days of printing very happy and I saved 200 €	1
The phone really deserves! Fast and responsive! A real splinter! Wonderful to see and even if it is similar to the others it is different anyway! The glass is also an elegance that I like very much including the weight that in the end gives it that sense of resistant object! I highly recommend it! !	1
The product arrived quickly and in advance of the expected date X the delivery. The unopened package and product ok	1
As always, iPhone is a guarantee, I come from a 6s plus and I have to say that despite the aesthetics is practically the same internally it is another thing much faster in loading and in daily use, perfect stereo audio, fantastic at the Touch ID that despite having been removed the physical key is precise and functional as always absolutely recommended !!	1
Simply iPhone that say perfect the best of all the phones in the world once you have it you do not do without it	1
Punctual seller, the phone arrived even earlier than expected, intact and 100% working. The only thing was the external box, a little ruined, but the one that contained the iPhone was perfect. Council	1
Perfect everything except the fact that I waited almost 2 weeks when it had to arrive earlier	1
Product arrived half a day in advance all sealed perfect I highly recommend the purchase	1
The time of consignment is one of the best ... but the rest are optimal.	1
Arrived immediately and in good condition.	1
I don't think the product needs reviews, like all iPhones is a good product, then everyone has their own tastes and preferences. 8 and not X for prowess against new technologies and for being able to buy a plus. The retailer was very kind in being able to trace the parcel and block it because, a little because under Christmas, partly because the GLS courier is perhaps not the best, there was some delivery problem. However the retailer responds, it helps for which nothing to complain.	1
I love it and I am very happy I had never used ifhone and I must say that I really love it 100%	1
The size at the beginning seemed to me excessive but then in use it is very comfortable. I am very satisfied with the purchase. I arrived at the set times.	1
The bigger screen of the plus is something exceptional ... I don't think I'll come back. Obviously it takes the bag to carry it back because in the pockets of the trousers it does not fit very well ... then anyway Apple reviews itself for the rest	1
Perfect. Complete with everything, arrived even earlier than expected. It's a gem, the photos are beautiful, and so are the videos, where you can use the zoom without losing sharpness.	1
What to say. TOP product of the TOP. Extremely expensive but unparalleled. I saved some money thanks to the offer I found on Amazon. Perfect service as always.	1
I think there is no need for a description ... after more than a year I am always satisfied	1
Perfect	1
Original product, I'm trying it and I'm very satisfied for now. The dimensions are bigger than my previous iPhone, but I'm getting used to it. The shipment was very fast, I received it 2 days after the order. Before the scheduled date. Thanks, great service.	1
Great phone, very fluid and powerful. Coming from an iPhone 5 the difference is even more remarkable. The only flaw is the weight, I would have liked to give up the glass back to get a few grams less, but it seems to be necessary for wireless charging.	1
excellent bumper .. protects the necessary without ruining the aesthetics of the telophone. perfect for those who maybe hate covers and want something small	1
iPhone 8? Three things: charging, grip and sound from the speakers. Which are not really aspects of the smartphone, but features added to the macro-features that already exist: autonomous charging, design grip and multimedia audio. There would be a little drawing to do, so simple to explain. IPhone 8, nice but always the same design since 2015iPhone 8, beautiful but still the same design since 20151. Top-up (wireless) I put wireless charging first because it's the only feature I'm already missing. It seems stupid and of little use, but having a support base on which to instantly load your smartphone is not foolish. For the occasion, I bought a recharge base on Amazon for € 9.99, which I placed on my bedside table in the bedroom. I don't know if it makes sense to take this base on the road, because it would only be something more to carry that would not give a real added value, compared to the normal USB-Lightning cable. I noticed that, with a cable, the iPhone 8 recharges 100% in about 1 hour, and with wireless charging in just under 2, but with the latter method the glass body behind warms up considerably. If it heats up in this period that the outside temperature is at maximum 28 degrees, I can only imagine what could happen in the summer with 40 degrees and more. In any case, wireless charging is very useful, especially since Apple has decided not to create its own standard, but to use the Qi standard which is very widespread.Grip, better with the iPhone 8 backside, grip is better with the shell rear in iPhone 8 glass, the grip is better with the rear body in glass I am trying out iPhone 8 while I look at that frying pan of the iPhone 7 Plus that I bought last year and which now seems terribly inefficient in terms of size. It almost seems that today, after all these models of smartphones with FullVision displays, InfinityDisplay and so on and so forth, "going back" to a smartphone with even a few millimeters of edges is like being back in 2003. As I have already written in the Galaxy S8 review, iPhone 7 Plus looks ugly and old to me. iPhone 8 has the exact same form factor as its predecessor, yet the rear glass body removes a bit of bitterness in the mouth. It is not just a matter of appearance: iPhoneItalia dear Andrea Cervone recently released a video on Youtube which clearly shows that glass resists all kinds of falls, and only yields to absurd falls - like those from a balcony.iPhone 8 doesn't seem to break even if you kick it and hit it against a tree. Seeing is believing. I obviously haven't tried it. Last, but not least, is the audio: it seems that many producers have made up their minds to turn their laptop and smartphone into speakers, because even iPhone 8 earns a good percentage more decibels, if we can say so. The volume is higher than the previous ones and the Galaxy S8, and it's really clean. Yes, it could be a reason to switch to iPhone 8, but not for me for example. And then? IPhone 8 actually has changes under the shell. But they are not very relevant. There is the new A11 Bionic chip, which has a dedicated processor for machine learning (but now is of little use), there is also a renewed camera that takes photos and shoots videos 2% better than the iPhone 7. And on iPhone 8 Plus there is the dual camera with which you can use Portrait Lighting, a mode that acts in real time on the portrait and highlights it, or puts it in black and white, and so on. For now, though, they're all games, the real applications that can take advantage of the A11 Bionic chip are still work in progress. I have said that neither iPhone 8 nor iPhone X are the real news from Apple, because Apple's direction is on reality (increased) - even Valentino, in his article, delves into augmented reality and the iPhone. In short, iPhone 8 is a small step forward, because one step was necessary to do so. Of course, 50% of iPhone users are waiting for the iPhone X because it is the most expensive smartphone for consumers in history (I don't count special editions and luxury smartphones). So, in a nutshell: if you come from iPhone 6 or earlier, iPhone 8 will be a big step forward. Otherwise, go ahead: the revolution has yet to come.	1
We're talking about a great phone. I am very well.	1
I had ordered this phone on April 4 and two days later I had already arrived. No problem, I had contacted the seller previously and I arrived early. Except that at the time of the FIRST ignition, then immediately after having discarded the phone presented a defect: a small blue dot inside the screen. I contacted the salesman who immediately replied telling me to send them details and everything and that on Tuesday he would send Bartolini to pick it up for the return. Being in right of withdrawal I didn't have to pay anything and the seller (CDS) took care of everything and I was sent back exactly two days later. After one week it works perfectly and I didn't see any problems. I am super enthusiastic and the products are original. Thank you for the availability of the seller and for having fulfilled all my doubts or requests and I am sure that in very few sellers they behave this way. Really professional and super efficient, I still bought from them.	1
Still in 2018 with top-of-the-range features! Today it is probably a best buy in the world of smartphones together with the 6S and the legendary SE.There is not much to say except "" iPhone "". Crazy quality as usual, impeccable device. Obviously the new iPhone 8 and X will have more performance and cutting-edge technology, despite this, the 7 is still a real Mr. iPhone.Consigliatissimo.	1
Original, new and arrived in perfect condition! Thank you	1
Hard to write a review on something that has very few flaws. Let's start by saying that the battery really surprised me, I won't go into the technical details but I must say that it keeps quietly more than a day and is very fast in the charging phase. The screen is, in my opinion, the right size for both word processing and multimedia content, and if we add to this the fact that it is really light, it does not bother you and is not at all cumbersome. The sacrifice of the cable Jack I think it was apt to improve the sound power thanks to the introduction of a second speaker. Another nice new feature is the home button, which no longer gives the impression that the whole screen is touch. In all honesty I was used to the old key, but with this we "" become attached "" the same. On the operating system I spend a few words but all positive because IOs 12 is not giving me any trouble either from the point of view of compatibility with apps and other devices and with battery life. Finally I think they have improved the design a lot by removing the unpleasant step that had the 6 (the step was due to the antenna) thus giving the phone a more serious and compact design.	1
Bought in September 2018 and still currently one of the best phones, much faster than the 6 and with new technologies that only Apple offers, thin, light, compact, excellent battery and for € 470 was a bargain. In my opinion there is no reason to take L 8 and if you are undecided go to 7 as these last 2 are the last with the very comfortable Touch ID and with the new physical key. In short, for me it remains the best price-quality iPhone even in 2018 since the new ones are bigger and only have Face ID and cost a salary!	1
what to say, it's an Apple. Although a bit obsolete it is preferable to iPhone 8 for many reasons including the price. iPhone 8 still has an excessive price and compared to 7 it only allows "wireless" charging and a slightly more powerful processor. The lags on the iPhone 8 are still considerable compared to 7. the screen is small, unfortunately	1
Fantastic smartphone even if at the moment there are more recent products. Great price of around 150 euros less than the official Apple store.	1
I got the first iPhone, it didn't read the SIMs, the problem was reported to the retailer who offered to be called after office hours. this problem occurred on a Friday evening, so the faulty piece was picked up on Monday and another new iPhone was delivered on Friday of the same week.	1
Purchased used "" as new "" directly from Amazon, but if it were not for the unsealed box you would not understand that it is not a new product. In the box there were also all the original accessories.A very good phone at a price just above a reconditioned.Battery that never gives problems, even in days of heavy use.Ordered in the evening to replace a reconditioned with broken antenna and not repairable, and delivered the next morning. PS eye to the origin of the reconditioned iPhone 7 because it seems that the breaking of the antenna is very frequent when they come from China and the United States (and in Italy there is no recall program).	1
Is Apple's iPhone 7 something to add? Those who love the apple already know what we are talking about .. whoever hates it too !! Amazon impeccable .. perfect product!	1
Probably the best old generation iPhone left over. Too bad that Apple's updates on older devices always bring some new limitations and a reduction in battery capacity	1
Iphone purchased for my girlfriend, who will replace a samsung. Unquestionable apple quality. Product arrived perfectly packed and with all standard accessories. Very satisfied.	1
Product arrived after a long wait (but it had been foreseen since the purchase) but in advance on the delivery date. For the rest, everything is ok, it works great like all iPhones (and compared to the new ones it is lighter and more manageable, but not much less powerful).	1
I am very satisfied with the Apple iPhone 7 Smartphoe 4G received via Amazon on time for delivery and efficient storage of the product, intact and in line with my expectations! More and more I will use Amazon, which I have already found competitive and excellent in the service rendered on other occasions!	1
Great phone. First experience with Iphone and certainly won me over. The next phone will be of the same brand.	1
I bought this iPhone 7 for my daughter and I must say she loved it. the pink gold color is wonderful and also the tel is excellent.	1
I have been using it for two years now and have never had any serious problems with a battery problem that Apple quickly solved for me.	1
years have passed since the purchase and I do not regret it. if I had the chance I'd also take the higher versions. absolutely!	1
Perfect	1
After two years some little bits begin to have not much contact and the battery does not last long (defect of many iPhone). I can say that I consider myself very satisfied with the article, which has accompanied me everywhere and that despite the many falls (both in water and not), he resisted	1
The smartphone is as I expected, 4.7 inches is the ideal screen size, mostly very thin at all bulky, excellent operation maybe 32 GB for some are a little few but for me they are enough!	1
Arrived in time in the tightly sealed package ... it seems to me the mioglir the phone that I have had even months after the purchase ...	1
Great product, top camera, good autonomy, perfect materials and assembly. I am convinced that Apple products have something more than Android smartphones. Frequent updates, the only flaw is recommended and they cost a lot.	1
I bought this iPhone in 2017 to make a gift, it arrived sooner than expected good quality price and arrived in a box protected enough not to cause damage, I recommend to everyone.	1
Arrived on time and intact. Nice I hope you last and have no problems	1
Mr. Roberto contacted me to provide assistance on the battery of the product, completely solving the problem and constantly monitoring the situation. These days, it's rare to meet this kind of professionalism that you can't really not recognize.	1
Very punctual delivery. Produced exactly as I expected, according to the description. The sheets inside were not in Italian, but only in other languages. Particularly irrelevant, because they are of no use.	1
Great phone, at a great price! Fast delivery. I didn't want to spend a crazy amount on the iPhone 8, which I think is very similar to its predecessor, so I feel very satisfied.	1
At first I was hesitant to order it, but it arrived in 2 days, in excellent condition and still fully functional !! So I was fully satisfied! I recommend it to anyone !!!	1
Great iPhone, without queues and a very fast address! All with sensational timing, thanks! Amazon is a must, very good! I have taken some articles but these last 3 have been very fast!	1
Original and new product, without any defect. Color as described. There is not much to say about it, it is a top of the range.	1
I received the phone ahead of the scheduled date. Product delivered with original Apple box; functioning, at the moment (I've been using it for two weeks), flawless. I highly recommend it.	1
Recommended purchase, practically like new, with 99% battery, it really looked brand new, fast with shipping, I would get it back immediately !!!	1
Bought for working purposes, the product is exactly the same as the one you can buy at Apple but with a favorable price. Great deal	1
I bought a matt black iPhone 7 from GLOBALTELEPHONE SPA and I must say that everything went well: shipping in 2 days and a new phone. I'm satisfied!	1
Look for complete reviews on the internet ..	1
Nothing to say, excellent phone, excellent room, good battery life, excellent response to commands. Nothing to say, really money well spent. Recommended	1
Excellent, recommended purchase	1
Well what about the phone you already know all about. very nice and fast. purchased at a great price. if you don't need much space, 32 GB is perfect	1
Arrived in a few days .. perfect condition is good .. satisfies all the qualities that I required .. the phone is excellent and does not show any problem yet .. I have only had it for a little over a month .. it is still like when it arrived!	1
great product, good price, fast delivery	1
phone new Apple original packaging packed, super fast delivery, great as a gift	1
when buying a product, it is important that it corresponds to what was shown in the sale and to the customer's expectations, so it was for me with this object.	1

recommended	1
For me it was a surprise after years of absolute loyalty to Samsung. I feel good and the expectation has been largely satisfied.	1
I was very happy, without scratches, without any break, and above all it works well, I leave a little doubt if it doesn't show problems later. thanks	1
As if I bought it at the Apple store	1
great phone, I already had an iPhone 5 and I wanted to continue with the choice trying not to go beyond the set baget, I recommend it	1
The shipment was timely. The product is more than satisfactory given the price with which it was purchased (new product).	1
Apple quality for a perfect cel and interesting cost	1
New product, fully functional, the value for money is there. Amazon staff always open and available to the customer.	1
Apple quality is not disputed.	1

New product, all in original packaging, verified at the store the activation date for which confirmed that it is not regenerated. Received exactly in the times indicated, very fast.	1
I was doubtful whether to buy only for fear that the phone might not arrive. Ordered on Friday it should have arrived the following Friday, but on Monday returned from work my package was already there waiting for me. Perfect phone, we all know the app	1
Of course the phone speaks for itself, so I review the seller - Digital Kingdom - which has met the deadlines perfectly and sent the phone in good packaging. The packaging is perfectly intact, original, all sealed. Good job!	1
Product arrived earlier than expected. Super Efficient Amazon (as always). Arrived in its original box with the protective film. Inside are all the default accessories. Among other things I had a problem with the bluetooth that nn connected and recognized no source in the surroundings, brought to the store they recognized the factory defect and promptly replaced. Apart from this, recommended retailer! Even in responses mail always fast and concrete.	1
New and perfect product, as described. Arrived earlier than expected, and in the original box. Including battery charger with Italian socket and headphones. Super seller available. I needed a tax bill and sent it to me in less than a day after the request. Super recommended!	1
Initially I was a little wary but reading the excellent reviews I decided to make the order and now I'm super satisfied! Product arrived in excellent condition and fully functional. The package even arrived two days ahead of the scheduled delivery date. The retailer in the mail replies is fast and kind ... what to say, super recommended !!	1
Very punctual delivery. The product arrived intact and working, in its original packaging and complete with accessories. Always satisfied with apple products!	1
A smartphone that has features that are still high-end today. Not to mention the screen with excellent backlighting and always clear colors. I recommend the 32 GB version to anyone because it is the right compromise between quantity and price. The operating system always reliable and with an initial phase of fast and intuitive setup, the only thing that really irritated me is that this Iphone (and I believe also the following ones) does not allow you to complete the initial setting if you do not introduce the SIM (which is the smaller version of the usual micro sim, that is the nano sim).	1
Arrived in 48h perfectly packed with original box the iPhone works perfectly I recommend it to everyone, being an iPhone lover I will buy it again from them in the future	1
The phone works great. The price was great ... I am very satisfied. Everything arrived packed in the original well-sealed box. One month from the purchase, I would recommend Amazon as always, offering impeccable service	1
What can I say, an impeccable Apple product. The price, as always, is excessive but the phone works perfectly. I recommend purchasing the minimum 128 GB version in how many phones will last you longer.	1
The article arrived earlier than expected in the usual excellent Amazon package. The only thing I would like to report is that in the package there are no instructions in Italian. For the rest, everything is excellent.	1
The iPhone arrived in the expected delivery time and this is important given that it was sent by a tertiary shop !! and for the Tel there is nothing to say and an original iphone at a great price since I only paid 586 € !!! I am satisfied with this purchase !!!	1
The phone was delivered on time, I found no problems. It does not require instructions for use as it is very intuitive.	1
Telephone arrived in a week, all well sealed and protected .. there was a big box with various plastic protections and packed phone .. all perfectly original and working .. I took the 32gb rose gold super beautiful. . I'm really happy with this expense! Highly recommended, utmost seriousness!	1
now i'm using it and it works like god, it has no problem, i got the 32giga matte black and it works perfectly	1
Telephone in perfect working order. I had an iPhone previously and I wanted to reconfirm the choice: actually Apple doesn't disappoint and for now I can say I'm satisfied with the purchase. It is certainly expensive, the only sore point.	1
like all apple products perfect in design, very light and practical ultra technological, excellent value for money flawless and fast shipping service as always, thanks amazon !!!!	1
The package arrived 4 days in advance, perfectly packed and sealed. The box is original and inside there are all the accessories. For now it works perfectly so I can be satisfied!	1
Excellent, I'm very happy it arrived early, it works great, great phone I'm satisfied and it's the same as the one in the store, arrived in perfect condition, I recommend it to everyone	1
Hi, I just bought a 32gb iphone 7 on Amazon from Cellularishop and it went well. The phone arrived two days immediately after the order, that is with a positive speed, and it was a great deal, the cel was packed and nothing was missing ... there was everything (earphones, chargers etc ..). I sincerely thank Amazon and the store (cellularishop) delighted with the good price.	1
The iPhone you all know, they were perfect punctual and everything was in place Eye to the iPhone 7 because it has no jack headphone jack inputs	1
Best price compared to the apple store and all other stores. Product that arrived on time and packaged. Purchase that I recommend to all those who are interested in saving several tens of euros for a new iphone	1
Purchased as a gift in order to replace an old 4S. The person who is using it is fully satisfied with clearly improved performance.	1
In my opinion, the product is excellent. The aesthetic is very beautiful and the functionalities are, as always, effective and intuitive.	1
Delivered in advance, excellent purchase given the savings of 110 euros, original iPhone. It was the first time I bought online for an important amount but I was very satisfied. IPhone 7 is extraordinary.	1
The order arrived earlier than reported, which of course is always synonymous with correctness and professionalism. I had some hesitations in buying a cell phone online but I changed my mind: unopened package, model and brand correspond. ask for the invoice separately.	1
Very high-performance phone, with crystal-clear audio and 2 speakers from which the bass feels good while listening to music, very nice also the very realistic push button, excellent 12mpx camera with 4k 30fps video. 1080p 120fps with external apps and 720p 240fps with external apps. I recommend the purchase. Package arrived 1 day in advance.	1
I have waited for the right offer is that it was a product sent at least by Amazon for not having to deal with third-party vendors that could slow down the time in case you should take advantage of the guarantee. I chose the gold-colored 32 Gb model which is very elegant and fine. As for the technical specifications I am not here to list them as they are now well known. Many fluid usage, and coming from an IPhone 5S I immediately noticed the difference (even if only for the larger screen). A tip: take it immediately a cover that is open or closed, the price of the phone requires it; if you choose the classic clear transparent covers that have the upside that protects the rear camera.	1
My first iPhone simply fantastic every detail is studied with the greatest attention to detail, excellent gesture that I did not know and the fake button with haptic feedback is amazing.	1
I was very satisfied with the availability given to me by the seller. It is difficult today to receive similar availability also in stores, considering the period of purchase and the cost with which I purchased a product that is not exactly 'cheap'. I would like to emphasize that due to a update not done when the phone was switched on, initially I had problems with the sound of the same. For this reason I was about to send the product back. Right from the start, the seller made himself available to solve the problem by planning a collection a few hours later, obviously in the manner and times most useful to both. Consider that I purchased this product at the end of the new year. Below I solved the problem by personally updating the phone software so as to restore the sound quality immediately absent. My suggestion to all buyers is to check and make, especially in products of this caliber, all the updates available for avoid unpleasant and unnecessary inconveniences on both sides. Communicate.	1
With Apple you are never wrong; excellent smartphone, very responsive, light, the s.o. is the best, as always, the battery lasts me 2 days abundant so I am fully satisfied! The phone arrived 4 days before the scheduled date, so also the delivery service was excellent, in addition to the really inviting price	1
It's a beautiful product, light, amazing to look at, fast, I found the iPhone 8 a step backwards in design, ergonomics and lightness! On this device you already know everything, but who cares? It's always nice to reiterate how fantastic the camera is, the build quality, how much to have a device like that in your hands simplify your life, why shouldn't you love it? Design: 10/10, it's beautiful, period. Autonomy: 9/10, lasts a lot. Aesthetics: 10 / 10Reactivity: 9/10 Quality ratio new price 5/10 used 10/10 (easy to get it for 160 euros) Overall I love this smartphone and I invite you to try it yourself before issuing a judgment :)	1
Delivery time respected and maximum product satisfaction, smartphone built "" at the state of the art "" very high rating in every respect, not least the price that is very advantageous through this seller.	1
Really top smartphones nothing to say the product arrived quickly I am very satisfied we say that I only returned it to try S8. But to be honest, after a couple of weeks I regretted getting along well with this product, in turn I returned the S8 because it gave me audio problems and I bought back an iPhone 7. I don't want to criticize Samsung for products. happen that some devices can have defects and it's mine was one of those without taking anything away from S8 that as a device is really exceptional. Returning to the iPhone 7 I'm not the first to find out so the features are really endless for the voice assistant really good, maybe it would be better to have an offline function like for Android but otherwise the transition from Android to Ios is really satisfied for now it doesn't come back	1
I state that I use Apple phones from 2012 with small pauses to try out the new Android operating systems, so I will try to be as objective as possible by making comparisons with Iphone 6 and 6s. Packaging and unboxing. The usual robust package of Apple phones, very simple with printed the back of the phone. Unboxing made easier by the fact that the plastic has a tab to tear off the protective plastic. Even the accidental drops have been averted because the phone is under the manuals. Inside the charger, cable, lightning cable to jack, lightning headphones, telephone of course. Materials and sensations to the touch. My phone is in Matt Black color. I have been using it for two months and compared to silver it is very noticeable the dirt. I'm not talking about fingerprints or anything like dust and lint that are noticeable compared to silver. But just clean it weekly. The feel is the usual one of Apple phones. Leaving out the 6 which gave me a feeling of little robustness (it bent success also to me) the 7 is robust like the 6s. Everything perfect, the usual obsessive care of Apple. User experience. Phone takes good, good sound in call. Also to listen to videos on youtube on 7 there are two speakers that give you the feeling of a fuller sound. The two boxes are positioned one next to the entrance of the lightning cable and the other next to the ear capsule. So phenomenal stereo sound like on no other phone. Ios 10 now with constant updates no longer suffers from tweaks that (albeit small) plagued the beta versions. Now Ios 10 appears mature and stable, with small innovations that will simplify the use making it more pleasant.3d Touch personally changed the use of the phone for the better I can not do without it. Last thing this iphone is waterproof so (also if you lose the guarantee) you will no longer have to worry if it falls into a puddle, for example. The telephone is fine, even if someone complains about small shutdowns and restarts, but it will only happen to me once in two months. Camera is the stabilizer optical for videos and more cleaning of photos. The 6s we say that he took pictures with a lot of noise in closed or poorly lit rooms. The 7 finally has a better camera. Battery I dedicate a separate section because there are improvements. I can do a day and a half with GPS and active bluetooth with average usage. Let's say that the stressful day surpasses it. Compared to the 6s improvements are there. Having said that, would you recommend it? If you come by 6 yes, you will be better off. Consider that the 6 has 1 GB of ram while the 7 has 2. In addition to the fact that it makes everything turn better. If you come from 6s no, you should wait for the next one. I sold the 6s and I took this but I'm a fan, I don't think it's normal for a normal user.	1
APPLE AND DIGITAL KINGDOM A GUARANTEE! IPhone purchased Friday afternoon and arrived Tuesday morning, nothing to complain. Fully satisfied, 5 stars deserved especially for the seller!	1
I was a bit scared because I bought the phone from a third party vendor but instead I was very happy. The new phone, packed and without a brand. Ordered on Monday and arrived on Thursday. Council!	1
Purchased for a gift, fast shipping and perfect packaging, the person to whom I gave it did not encounter any problems and found itself very well with this device, recommended purchase.	1
Everything perfectly in order and therefore in accordance with what I expected. I could not add anything different to what I just wrote.	1
The package had arrived open, so I was annoyed. But fortunately the iPhone is perfect, it has no defect and everything works perfectly. I recommend the purchase.	1
Arrived as planned, great packaging. Perfect phone and fully functional. Needless to review a product that everyone knows and appreciates around the world.	1
Telephone that gives security already from the name of the manufacturer. Very fast and efficient. Absolutely original as from Amazon shipping, recommended product!	1
Perfect!! Great buy as usual security. You can buy it with your eyes closed. Great features good battery life. At the moment!!	1
I haven't opened it yet, but the package is intact and sealed by the house. He arrived in two days and responds to the published product	1
The title is to highlight the speed with which the phone arrived .. in a working day! The box and the product are also impeccable.	1
great product, simple to use, after years with the android operating system, I immediately found myself very well packaged, arrived early	1
Many have written before me, so I will not repeat the usual things, especially as it is the 3rd iPhone I buy on Amazon in 4 years. For those few who still do not know: 1) the color refers to the back of the phone: in front is white; 2) 100% product for the Italian market; 3) the actual memory is around 112 GB, 4) this lightning adapter, not the wireless headphones (sold separately), but the ear pods, 5) my it was already loaded in the box and updated to iOS 10.3. Pay attention if you need to make a backup from a device updated to 10.2: you will have to go back to the new one from 10.3 to 10.2, transfer the backup and then update to 10.3.	1
I wanted to congratulate the neophonia shop for the seriousness and quality in following the customer, buying the iPhone 7 smartphone 4G 128 GB, I was a bit skeptical about buying this product with a discount of almost 150 euros compared to the various shopping malls, instead everything arrived with precision both the color and all the other product working perfectly even delivered with 2 days in advance, we thank amazon and NEOPHONIA.	1
My first Iphone that did not make me at all regret a smartphone from the Samsung range. Easy to use for those who are familiar with the technology, very useful for many features inside the basic ios apps, such as the ability to scan documents (in the Notes app). It's a mini-computer in effect, I wouldn't exchange it with other Android.	1
I took these Iphone even if a little hesitant. I really have to think again! The shipment was only two working days! And the phone is perfect! Exactly the same that you would find in any store, only with a substantial difference of almost 200 euros! I will definitely buy again online!	1
After having had an iPhone 5 series for years, I switched to this product and I must say that the leap in quality is abysmal and the improvement is enormous. I will not dwell on the technical characteristics of the product, nor on the content of the package or on the construction materials; thousands of other reviews and web pages talk about this. What I want to focus on, however, is my experience of use. I want to talk about what I feel, using this phone, and the feelings I have in everyday use. I have been using this phone for months and I must say that I have never had any problems whatsoever. The product is very reliable and I know that at any moment I will be able to take advantage of it without any hitch. In web browsing there are no lag or slowdowns, the opening of the app is very fast and even the gaming experience is unmatched. The quality of the images is great , thanks to a well optimized hardware and to a display with bright and vivid colors. Surely there are not those innovations and those technological widespread on the android products, like for example the frontal notification led, but this lack is not felt at all. overall quality of the product is unmatched and, even when it is grasped, one becomes aware of this. The metal body, the construction materials, the quality of the assembly make you feel the full weight of an obsessive attention to even the smallest detail. Software updates provided directly by the manufacturer, guaranteeing long product life, are not lacking. Certainly the price is high, but in my opinion it should be considered as an investment. If you spend so much to buy this product, you will have a phone that will have top performance for a long time and that will not quickly depreciate, as happens too often with android products. Definitely yes, I recommend it to those who are already in the Apple world or want to enter this world. With this product you will experience the best of this brand and you will fully understand its greatness. If my information was useful to you, let me know.	1
I bought the phone7 for a gift, the phone arrived well sealed and brand new, I wrote email to the seller Bacom for invoice and he promptly replied by sending me the invoice the next day and telling me that Apple answers the first year and the second Bacom. The person to whom I gave it has found that the battery is discharged in half a day, he tried to do the iOS update as advised by Apple, I wrote to the seller and he responded promptly and egregiously to try for a few days and eventually contact them again. I was very hesitant about buying online, but for now I am completely satisfied with the assistance I received. Now we hope to solve the battery problem. Update: the phone had problems and was quickly replaced by Bacom. Five stars !	1
Inside the box we know the new chuffie with the adapter. The display is 4.7 with 32 GB of memory, with the ios 10 operating system updateable to iOS 11.03. The iPhone 7 consists of the new home button, which inside the phone is the motor that allows the button to work.	1
Apple's impressive phone has always been a guarantee. It is the first iPhone I buy on amazon and I can consider myself more than satisfied I recommend everyone to buy !!!	1
Nothing to say. It was time I wanted to switch to the iOS system from the Android and I don't regret it! The phone arrived almost a week early. Completely intact and well sealed! Really Satisfied	1
I had an iPhone 5S for 3 years and I never had any problems until he stopped reading my SIM and repairing it would have cost me more than taking a new one. iPhone 7 is very similar to my old 5S in terms of functions but as a design there is no comparison, the iPhone is much more appealing. I was very satisfied with the seller who, despite not being able to provide me with the tracking of the order, kept me updated by e-mail about the arrival and the fact that he would arrive 2 days late due to the bridge on 25 April. a 10 on the phone and a 9 to the office1one seller.	1
He arrived punctually as promised. It works great. I have no negative comments to make. Everything in place. I have already used the camera with excellent results.	1
I ordered the cell phone that would be available from February 28th, but on Thursday 23rd the phone was shipped and it arrived 25th morning with 5 days advance on delivery! First time I use iPhone but not ios as operating system! iPhone 7 is fantastic, the only thing that did not convince me was the key no longer to be pressed like before, but using the mobile phone I changed my mind about that 'single insecurity! 5 stars deserved both from Apple and from Amazon!	1
Perfect product with fast shipping. Great service from the seller and phone with original packaging and all the accessories, as if I had bought it from Apple. I give 5 stars just because there are not more.	1
Seller to say the least excellent: attentive, capable, thoughtful, available immediately and 24 hours a day. With regards to the product, it arrived sealed, brand new and with no defect whatsoever. Really satisfied !!!!	1
iPhone 7 excellent Shipping was precise and punctual The package was packaged very well, disaster-proof. The phone has been working fine so far I found no problems or lack	1
Beautiful Mobile! And also very comfortable in your hand! It is fantastic and also very super fast and is very excellent / excellent to use. regards Christian I recommend it to those who love Apple.	1
Ordered late on Wednesday 26 April with delivery scheduled between Saturday 29 and Wednesday 03 May; in reality the courier delivered it to me on Friday 28th at 11.30 am !!! The article was perfectly packaged, complete with all the accessories and fully satisfying the description on the site. To date, the operation is perfect.	1
The perfect phone right now you can't ask for better. If this is the size of the screen you are looking for take it (and if you can afford it)	1
Needless to present this space phone, what can I tell you? iPhone 7 today even with the release of galaxy s8, remains a gem! the desire of all those who love ios, apple and the user friendly experience! because it is what we are talking about, a device capable of adapting to the hands of the less experienced like few. The search for apple for the user experience is something that goes far beyond any other company and I tell you from one who knows a lot about ios and development for the aforementioned fact. if you want a phone that makes you feel like it's done for you, then iphone is the right choice	1
Perfect in everything	1
Product of 10 and praise, what else to say: it beats every other phone. Personally, I chose the 128 GB model to fully enjoy the phone without having to worry about space, and after a month I think I made the right choice.	1
I bought the iPhone 7 a few days ago and I have only positive comments. The phone is new and arrived in excellent condition and with all the associated accessories. Fast delivery	1
Excellent product, reliable seller. Arrived new, fantastic	1
Great everything went well	1
Inside the package there are the earphones, the charger, the usb / lightning cable and the adapter for the audio jack, on the phone in fact there is no longer the classic round hole where to insert the earphones, but now we only use the brings lightning for everything. On the hardware and software performance of the phone, nothing to say, apple is now at the forefront. Luminous screen with a very high definition 1334x750 pixel at 326ppi, 4.7 inch hd retina display. The 7plus version has a 5.5 display with 1920x1080 pixels at 401 ppi. IP67 certified against dust, splashes and water. The processor is an A10 Fusion chip with a 64-bit architecture plus an integrated M10 motion coprocessor. 12MP camera, aperture ƒ / 1.8 aperture, digital zoom up to 5x. The 7plus version has 12MP cameras with wide-angle and telephoto, wide-angle diaphragm: f / 1.8 and telephoto: 2.8 / 2.8, plus 2x optical zoom; up to 10x digital zoom. On both models there is optical image stabilization, quad-LED True Tone flash, sapphire crystal lens coating, autofocus with Focus Pixels, face and body detection, automatic HDR for photos, sequential shooting mode , self-timer and photo geotagging. For videos we have 4K recording at 30 fps, HD recording (1080p) at 30 fps or 60 fps, HD recording (720p) at 30 fps, optical video image stabilization, quad-LED True Tone flash, slow-motion (1080p at 120 fps; 720p at 240 fps), Time-lapse with stabilization, continuous autofocus, face and body detection, ability to take 8MP photos while shooting in 4K, zoom during video playback and video geotagging. The central physical key is always missing, now the new Home key, like on the 6s, always has the integrated fingerprint sensor but it is soft touch, that is nn crushes but only leans the finger, with the possibility of setting the sensitivity '. The volume buttons and the lock / unlock button remain, in addition to the levers for the silent mode. Autonomy up to 14 hours in conversation (2 more than 6s) and up to 10 days in standby, up to 12 hours in LTE and 14 in WI-FI, up to 13 hours of video playback and 40 hours of audio playback . we also find barometer, 3-axis gyroscope, accelerometer, proximity sensor and ambient light sensor. Comparing it with the previous model, the dimensions are the same even though the weight is slightly lower, faster processors, IP67 certification, camera with the same resolution but we have a smaller aperture, image stabilization, detection as well as also faces of the bodies and finally the quad-LED true tone flash, Idem for the video camera.	1
Arrived on time on the delivery, unopened package, all as I expected, I still have to try the supplied headphones, for now with the mobile I am fine (very similar to the iPhone 5 I had) I Devon anchors accustomed to the touch button	1
Bought in the sidereal gray color and I must say that it is really beautiful in every part. Superb from a visual point of view, it immediately strikes the eye, both from a technical point of view and from the point of view of use. I think it is one of the best smartphones on the market, I highly recommend the purchase.	1
I state that I didn't buy this smartphone on Amazon, but I wanted to expose my opinion on this new iPhone 7. I have always owned an Android smartphone and I had to get used to the new iOS system. I really liked the new iPhone 7, it's easy to use, very fluid and intuitive. I wanted to buy the iPhone 6s but then I bought the iPhone 7 because it doesn't have the bars on the back like the 6 / 6s that I honestly didn't like, and then because compared to 6 / 6s it has a bit bigger battery, finally a 4-core processor (2 high-efficiency main and 2 for energy saving), finally a 2gb RAM, stereo speakers and finally waterproof. Thanks to its size it is quite comfortable to use with one hand. In conclusion, a great smartphone	1
I previously had an IPhone 5s ... the 7 with more features is more than perfect ... the photography is greatly improved. Also the price compared to the purchase in the store, excellent.	1
FIRST IMPRESSIONS The box, as usual Apple is quite minimal. Inside we find: the headphones with lightning connector, the Lightning-Jack 3.5 adapter and the usual power supply. DESIGN Frontally we notice the home button that is no longer physical but virtual, in fact inside there is a "motor" that returns the feed of the vibration that can be set at 3 levels, at the beginning it left me a bit perplexed but I got used to it quickly and now I prefer it even to the mechanical one. Below we have the speakers and the microphone, for the rest it is like the previous devices. The phone is very compact and light, in fact it immediately gives a feeling of excellent weight balance between the internal components; I bought the matte black color and the touch and feel is beautiful, it looks like a small perfectly polished stone. I appreciated that the camera was made "to re-enter" slightly giving a more tapered appearance to the device and that Apple has finally given waterproofing with IP67 certification. SCREEN 750x1334, IPS, 4.7 "Perfect display, the colors are excellent as in all IPS and the blacks are the typical ones of the Amoled, absolute, moreover the viewing angle is perfect and the screen can be seen in any light condition. on resolution, in my opinion a few more pixels could fit, although I believe that the decision to reduce the resolution was made to optimize the battery as much as possible. CAMERA The 12MP camera is excellent: the tip is instantaneous and the various shooting modes are very interesting (overview, etc ...).The photos are very well, in fact those little problems that the 6 had with the photos in the dark have been solved, about the environments with so much light there is no need to say anything, they are photographs to show. The videos are excellent thanks also to the 'introduction of optical stabilization, you can record in 4K at 30fps or 1080 at 60fps (which I prefer), slow motion and time-lapse are great .. AUTONOMY In my opinion Apple has managed to solve that Achilles heel that has always marked all iPhones, the battery. In fact, despite the phone being very light the battery optimization is excellent, in fact I managed to completely overcome the stress day with only the 1950mAh of the device. Given the low capacity of the battery (although the phone can manage it very well) I recommend using low voltage power supplies to make it last as long as possible, in my opinion the quick refills in the long run ruin it. USE EXPERIENCE & CONCLUSIONS The new iOS 10.0.1 operating system is excellent, in fact a global search has been introduced that works very well and the 3D-Touch has been integrated with almost all the applications, moreover the maps that are now improved they work excellently. Under the telephone point of view the telephone behaves well, in fact the reception is in line with the 6s although the radio antennas have been moved to give a better weight balance to the device. As for the speakerphone, I really appreciated that Apple has made the earpiece a stereo speaker along with the main one, this guarantees excellent call quality even in hands-free mode that works great even in the car at high speeds, overall I feel good and feel good they feel good. The phone runs well, in fact the 2GB of RAM Apple and the new A10 Fusion processor guarantee excellent daily usability: both social networks and Safari behave very well; however there are some microlag during the animations but I think it is absolutely normal and I can guarantee that they are absolutely negligible. In conclusion I can say that this iPhone does not differ much from its predecessor, perhaps the upgrade rationally does not suit even if honestly those small aspects in which Apple has put their hands have become the new points of excellence of the phone.

CAMERA The 12MP camera is excellent: the tip is instantaneous and the various shooting modes are very interesting (overview, etc ...).The photos are very well, in fact those little problems that the 6 had with the photos in the dark have been solved, about the environments with so much light there is no need to say anything, they are photographs to show. The videos are excellent thanks also to the 'introduction of optical stabilization, you can record in 4K at 30fps or 1080 at 60fps (which I prefer), slow motion and time-lapse are great .. AUTONOMY In my opinion Apple has managed to solve that Achilles heel that has always marked all iPhones, the battery. In fact, despite the phone being very light the battery optimization is excellent, in fact I managed to completely overcome the stress day with only the 1950mAh of the device. Given the low capacity of the battery (although the phone can manage it very well) I recommend using low voltage power supplies to make it last as long as possible, in my opinion the quick refills in the long run ruin it. USE EXPERIENCE & CONCLUSIONS The new iOS 10.0.1 operating system is excellent, in fact a global search has been introduced that works very well and the 3D-Touch has been integrated with almost all the applications, moreover the maps that are now improved they work excellently. Under the telephone point of view the telephone behaves well, in fact the reception is in line with the 6s although the radio antennas have been moved to give a better weight balance to the device. As for the speakerphone, I really appreciated that Apple has made the earpiece a stereo speaker along with the main one, this guarantees excellent call quality even in hands-free mode that works great even in the car at high speeds, overall I feel good and feel good they feel good. The phone runs well, in fact the 2GB of RAM Apple and the new A10 Fusion processor guarantee excellent daily usability: both social networks and Safari behave very well; however there are some microlag during the animations but I think it is absolutely normal and I can guarantee that they are absolutely negligible. In conclusion I can say that this iPhone does not differ much from its predecessor, perhaps the upgrade rationally does not suit even if honestly those small aspects in which Apple has put their hands have become the new points of excellence of the phone. PRO Waterproofing Excellent stereo sound Virtual Home Button VS Price If this review was helpful to you on Yes below, thank you!	1
Purchased used in "" excellent "" condition. Price of water slightly below the lowest price found on the net, € 491 (used Amazon) against € 499 (new). The phone arrived in one day as a great Amazon service and was in really perfect condition, apart from the slightly ruined box. But the Amazon warranty has no equal, two years of absolute tranquility that ....... DO NOT HAVE PRICE !!!!!!!!	1
I took it to give it to my wife. Generally we never take the latest version of the iPhone because the prices seem immoral. After some time we update. I must say that from 5C to 7 it is a nice step forward. He arrived, in fact I went to pick him up in the post at Tarcento because the postman didn't find my home (I get hundreds of packages a year !!), so I still don't know how to evaluate the object well, but my wife seems happy, so it will probably be my next purchase.	1
Purchased for my uncle who came from an iPhone 4s and was very happy with the transition: besides the fact that the migration from old to new device is very easy, I preferred to let him take another iPhone mainly because he used to use this iOS system. If I had taken an Android from it, the migration would have been a bit traumatic, above all because it is a person over 60. New, packaged and original product, complete with power supply and earphones. Very satisfied	1
Excellent phone with structure and details of excellent quality and excellent performance as expected from Apple which is already a guarantee	1
I think there is little to write on the phone. Apple is always a certainty. As for the transaction, everything is ok, fast and above all punctual	1
Phone in use for 3 days all perfect, the packaging is totally new with cellophane, including all accessories such as earphone, instructions, and charger. Fast Shipping! it's the second iphone 7 I buy from this retailer and I've never had any problems!	1
The iPhone 5 I had passed to my wife had come to an end. Not wanting to spend more than necessary, and wanting to stay on Apple terminals, I took this iPhone 7. Fast, capacious, with excellent battery life. A warranty!	1
Purchased for a colleague who, passing from an iPhone 4s, was enthusiastic about it! Compact and light, it still proves to be very fast in daily operations even though it came out almost 3 years ago.	1
Excellent phone, it has a battery with a discrete duration that allows, if used in a moderate way, not to charge for 2 days.	1
Product arrived 1 day late, only due to the end-of-year festivitiesAll as described on the site, no surprises, everything okProduct valid and for now devoid of defects	1
I ordered two iphone 7s (arrived within 20 hours) and by mistake instead of ordering 1 black and one silver I ordered all two blacks. I wrote to the seller and immediately requested a return. They repaid me within 5 days. Instead the other iphone goes great. Highly recommended ....	1
The smartphone arrived a day ahead of schedule perfectly packed. The apple package was sealed with the related films. The first days of use show a snappy iphone that consumes little battery power.	1
Best price available on online market place. Top of the line among the market phones there is the perfect integration between hardware and software. Top of the range camera	1
For the price I paid for it was absolutely worth it, fully functional, original Apple. You can trust them!	1
The phone arrived on time and as from descriziine..beautiful.It was a gift and the person to whom I gave it was very satisfied ..	1
Apple, excellent quality even after months and months of use. Excellent operating system is definitely the best is the impeccable build quality	1
Excellent product for yield and quality and above all in compliance with the photo.	1
Battery could be improved. But purchase is one of satisfaction. Super Amazon	1
Original phone and it works perfectly	1
bought in black friday, really cheap price with great discount. taken for a gift so I can't review the product but only the delivery	1
Great cell phone, apple never disappoints	1
Purchased some time ago for the competitive price, I later preferred a more opaque black version. I will not dwell on the product on which you will find thousands of reviews on the net: I believe that today at Apple is the best in terms of function / quality /price. I have been using iPhones since the beginning and I am satisfied with the reliability and usability of these products, without wanting to take any fanboy positions.	1
In this case the stars go not only to the product, which remains one of Apple's spearheads even after the release of the iPhone 8, but also in service. There was a delay in delivery, but thanks to the Amazon features I was able to contact the seller, clarify the problem and find an agreement on the review of delivery times. Without being too anxious for an article that seemed to be lost! Brava Apple, good Amazon and good Digitech in managing the relationship with the customer.	1
Well, it's not for me because I'm an andriod employee ... but the person to whom I bought it was so great and satisfied, that it allowed me to write a very positive review !! Obviously the brand says it all , the same quality, what to say, you know it better than me ... so it's a great buy and the highest quality !!	1
the phone looks as expected, produced by Apple then a quality smartphone, however it is a phone where you pay more for the brand than the quality of the smartphone in itself, a samsung s8 excels much more regarding the quality of the screen and photographs. however for those who are avid apple is recommended as always.	1
Product arrived on schedule, perfectly packed with original box the iPhone works perfectly I recommend it to everyone, being a lover of the iPhone	1
the product arrived on time without having suffered damage the perfect product package reflects what the seller described ie IPHONE 7 rose gold. for a factory defect I had to contact the seller who answered me immediately and without wasting time confirmed me that the europe warranty is valid in all apple centers in italy; in fact as soon as I went to Apple I was replaced in warranty the product. perfect and working phone, excellent camera, excellent display, in my opinion the best smartphone for value for money.	1
It seems to me useless to review the product, we know well that it is safe with Apple (and we will miss it with what it costs). So it remains for me to say that the product arrived on schedule, well packaged, and without nasty surprises. I've been using it for a month now, and I haven't found any problems. Congratulations	1
The phone was not for me, but I opened the package and saw it running. First he arrived early in just two days. The packaging was perfect. Inside a bigger box there was the typical Apple incelofanata package, with obviously inside the cell and all the accessories. The new cell phone works perfectly (up to now, one day after receipt). Ps. Digital Kingdom Dealer	1
I was a bit hesitant to buy because my mother was just a victim of an online scam just when she bought an iphone (not on amazon) but what can I say? The phone is perfect, arrived packed and also protected by a cardboard overpack. The Globalphone seller proved to be more than sure: excellent price and the iPhone even arrived a day early on schedule and anticipated by text message the day before that warned me of the sudden arrival of the package	1
Truly exceptional, it is true we all want to save but my dear, unfortunately the quality is paid, not for fraud at times but precisely because the products have a value, as in this case an apple iphone7 resistant to water, shock, excellent for every circumstance. I recommend it more to the professionals than me.	1
The iPhone does not need further reviews. Bought by the Digital Kingdom of Rome seller, I had no problem, he answered my questions, taken at the lowest price compared to other sellers, without any problem.	1
I went from Android to iPhone 7 for the first time and I had a great time, the phone is fast and intuitive, the calls are in high quality and the reception is excellent !! Remarkable the camera, which despite not having high megapixels guarantees always photos at the top !!! I would not go back to Android	1
The phone is great, much better than what I thought and seen on the photos, the 128 memory really recommended, I have no space problem. The seller was quite helpful and courteous, only after a day when I ordered the phone I received a message before the date scheduled for shipment by the courier (DHL) saying to stay at home because the product will arrive until the end of the day and I had to stay at home all day and no product arrived that day, but instead arrived on the last day, obviously it was not the seller's fault. However very satisfied with my online purchase, Amazon always good. Thanks	1
Product arrived after only 2 days. Well packaged, undamaged and packed in its original packaging. Provenance from Eastern Europe (specified in the Europe Guarantee description). Perfect phone; after 1 month from the purchase it goes great. Recommended.	1
It will cost a few hundred euros more, but it remains the king of smartphones. Fast, safe, intuitive, great camera! I will never abandon Apple! Buy it!	1
The phone arrived earlier than expected, it was in the original package with nylon on it, with the IMEI check it appears that the September warranty is already active but that's ok. The gift was a great one. The convenience of buying on Amazon and that was a better price, plus the availability of color and 128 GB memory capacity. For rest it works fine.	1
I took this phone in January 2017, paid 689 (?) Compared to Apple's 900. Until now I have not had any problem with the battery or extra operation. If I remember correctly, shipping was faster than expected.	1
I think that it is not possible to describe the efficiency and quality of this product which is excellent at its best. Amazon management is impeccable. The great seller. I am very very satisfied. I highly recommend	1
Perfect product, I recommend everyone to purchase. I think it's a great buy now for Christmas because the price is not so easily accessible.	1
Beautiful cover with excellent aesthetic and protective features. Beautiful black matte border and bright transparent back. Newly raised feet protect the camera	1
Nothing to say, as always Apple offers high quality products. No need to enter other information, for this product would be wasted words	1
What to say is the phone. Excellent arrived in a very short time perfectly functioning and in perfect quality. To have. There is no smartphone other than iphone	1
Great product .. delivery done very quickly .. I recommend this seller ... I had no doubt about the functionality of the cell ... I recommend the iPhone 7 excellent cell phone .. also excellent battery	1
The best iPhone ever ... super camera, app to the max .. the only flaw is and if you're using headphones you can't put the phone in charge. For the rest it is the top.	1
Arrived as expected on the first useful day, despite the fact that there were Christmas holidays, product as described arrived intact perfectly sealed in its original box.	1
Everything perfect, phone like from Apple store, arrived in no time, invoice included, I recommend it, don't be afraid to buy ...	1
well what to say ..... who buys iphone always goes on the safe side excellent and reliable .... maybe a little high price but worth it ....	1
After having an iPhone 4, then a 5s, it was time to change it, it gave various problems. So I took the 7 even if a 7s or even 8 is about to be released. I preferred to save quite a bit by taking the 7, choosing the European warranty and the 32 Gb. For bad that goes I can buy the Apple Care and have the extended guarantee. I preferred the 32 Gb instead of the 128 Gb because I don't use the cell phone for the music and I use it very little for the photos, I have a good reflex for this. In doing so, I saved the 100 euro difference between the two models. I chose to have further savings by taking the Matt Black, the 5s I had was similar, Grigio Siderale. Nothing more to say about the quality of the product, it will be surpassed only by the next upcoming model. In short I think I made a good purchase by paying it 580 euros, shipping included. Great seller Digital Kingdom.	1
I don't really believe in reviews on Amazon related to the top of the range smartphones, since there are specific blogs where competent technicians illustrate vices and virtues of the latest discoveries (vice versa, it seems more appropriate to review on little-known amz devices, of which there are no it is a trace on the web). On the iPhone 7 everything has been said and written: rather, I would like to point out that the choice of the seller from which to buy the smartphone is essential. In fact, these products are never sold by Amazon, but from external stores that rely on venders here. Very often the evaluation of the user is invalidated by the behavior of the seller, which has nothing to do with the characteristics of the product. This confirms that selecting the seller here is much more important than evaluating the product itself, since the latter knows it all. Having said that, in my case GLOBALPHONE Srls proved to be fast, cheap (610 €) and impeccable. Do not therefore have doubts about this store. For all others, rely on specific seller reviews (NOT on the product) evaluating and comparing other users' buying experiences like us. Good shopping!	1
I have the second one I buy and I am satisfied with it, they work well, I am in Italian, no defect and in addition you save, you want more	1
A product that has kept faith with expectations, it is extremely elegant and fine, as far as the technical specifications are concerned, it seems to me pointless to indicate them here when they are present everywhere. Excellent and fluid in use, externally delicate, I recommend buying immediately covers and films to avoid unpleasant incidents.	1
Mobile that speaks for itself, (and there are thousands of reviews on the internet). Aesthetically the same as its predecessor iphone 6 / 6s and at software level it does not differ much from the previous one (so the upgrade does not recommend it). Bought and shipped directly from Amazon which is synonymous with guarantee, the mobile phone has arrived sealed like all its accessories. Italian box. Italian Warranty.	1
5 stars deserved, Apple as always amazes with its products. Let's analyze this magnificent product step by step. The competition offers better hardware at half the price, yes, it's true. So why pay for a phone with half the GB of RAM compared to any Android phone? I answer that iPhone has the operating system that makes the difference. So yes, spend more on a phone with a good, stable, working and intuitive operating system, it's worth it. No matter how much RAM they add in each new device with Android, because the free memory will always be small, it would be used already when the phone is switched on to load useless apps that most of the time you will never use (and that are not removable ), make the system heavier. IOS is extremely light and 2 GB of RAM guarantee perfect operation and fluidity, furthermore the system apps that you are not interested in can be eliminated. IOS is an operating system designed to work directly on its hardware, for better optimization and consumption savings. energetic, unlike Android which is very generic to be adapted in different phones among the various brands. In fact, even though it has a standard battery that may seem small and outdated (around 1970 mAh), the operating system optimized exclusively for its CPU (with extremely low power but at the same time powerful), guarantees a good battery life. With prolonged use it is possible to face the whole day, in my case that I am not an avid geek, I managed to make a maximum of 48 hours between one charge and another with average use (receiving / making phone calls / video calls, messages whatsapp and listen to music). iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rank first in the benchmark ranking for their videogaming performance. In November 2016 it appears to have the best most powerful processor in the telephony market. It has 2 stereo speakers, the sound is of excellent quality (not at earphones levels, but excellent for being tiny speakers) and they sound extremely loud, no phone holds the comparison with its speakers, not even its predecessor 6s.The sound transfers better if it is placed on the table, the music will be deeper and more powerful. The supplied earphones are also excellent, the sound is clean and even the bass tones are excellent. There is a remote control with microphone, with volume keys at the ends and a multifunctional control unit (to change music, answer the phone or reject the call). Furthermore, the remote control can also be used to take pictures (by pressing the + button or - when using the camera app). The Home button is no longer mechanical because in the old series it broke easily with use, it was replaced with one that in reality is not possible to press, to the touch a motor is activated that vibrating simulates the pressure of the old button, it may seem strange in the beginning but you get used to it soon, theoretically its life should last longer. The camera takes incredibly sharp pictures, so far I have not taken a photo out of focus (even in extreme low light conditions, thanks to the wide aperture that captures more light and the optical image stabilizer that does a really good job, avoiding the blurred photos. Small negative notes, how much the phone costs I would have expected a screen with higher resolution (personally I don't care about a screen with very high resolutions, with the naked eye you don't see the pixels, but a possible future purchase of VR glasses is to be excluded on this HD screen), a memory expansion slot and a faster focus. Attention is not slow to the point of being alarming, but for example the Samsung s7 focuses faster and costs less as well. According to many, the lack of the 3.5 mm jack penalizes the phone, but honestly I do not miss it because of the use I make of it, I do not happen to charge the phone and use the earphones, if one day I had to feel the need, with a few euros you can buy a lightnin door splitter. Given the negative notes, for me it remains a valid smartphone and I reiterate that to make the real differences is the operating system, after all I think what a buyer looks for , deep down, it's just the reliability of his mobile phone. After almost a month from the purchase I can only feel satisfied with the purchase, never a crash of the app, sudden phone reset or various anomalies. Who should I recommend? Surely not to those who have an iPhone 6s, there are differences but the game is not worth the candle. E 'can recommend it to those who have an iPhone too old or those like me, got tired of using both Android and Windows Phone and finally decided to try IOS.	1
Very fast and with a fantastic design, I never had an iPhone and being my first time, I loved it and I am very happy for the purchase.	1
Great Apple home product, I would say very good silver coloring, fast shipping even if standard, delivered in 2 working days, product that reflects all aspects, happy with the purchase and mainly for the fairly low price being a top of the range, I recommend it to everyone, seller with fast shipping, the box was wrapped in a bubble film to protect it from shocks! Congratulations to apple and the retailer	1
The product is original, I had a bit of trouble one day after arriving (not very punctual even though I requested express shipping) because the phone turned black by itself, I called the apple center which told me that the device did not seem to have any particular anomalies and they suggested me to do it anyway, the retailer was very professional and assisted me by replacing the phone with a new one in a sealed package and for this professionalism and assistance I give 5 stars.	1
Perfect	1
I was really doubtful about buying this phone or not, especially for the advantageous price compared to the store, but I had to change my mind. By now I have been using the phone for a week and it has no problem. It works great, I received the receipt from the seller and I feel really good.	1
Perfect seller, the phone there is nothing to add ... a war machine ... I have always used iPhone except a parenthesis lasted from last July until the arrival of the iPhone 7, months in which I used a s7 edge. .. what to say? iPhone all life!	1
A product that does not need so much praise. It is the most a user can have, I am very happy with it! I purchased several products from Amazon and I never took a rip-off.	1
Perfect	1
When the phone came, it didn't turn on, contacted the twenty-one said to keep it in charge for a long time, nothing to do, the next day contacted again, very helpful he sent an email with the postponement sheet for the broken phone, the next morning passed the courier took the package, and given the distance of the seller (sicilia) the new phone arrived after 3 working days. But the second submission was perfect. Good seller and kind. It was not his fault that the first one was broken, because it was wrapped up and therefore he could not verify.	1
The phone is fine and we are satisfied it is possible that it will be chosen by others who want to think about buying the iPhone	1
Excellent as described. I was afraid it was a hoax instead it is really perfect. Supplied with all accessories. Nothing to complain	1
the product looks like a very well made mobile phone of excellent workmanship and with a very elegant shape	1
It arrived before the date, it seems to me a great product with warranty and European charger, the autonomy of the phone has been improved and I can get to the evening with a good percentage of battery with a medium-high use. I chose the matt black color that makes the phone very elegant. Very happy, I recommend it.	1
It is the first time I have ordered such an important article on Amazon. Maximum satisfaction! Item ordered on Saturday and arrived Tuesday, after three days. Perfect packaging and packaging. Item New and perfect, as purchased at the Apple store, but with a noticeable savings! I gave it to my mom and was left speechless! Just Beautiful! Thanks Amazon and thanks to all the collaborators	1
I arrived the day after the order, despite having selected the standard shipment. The iPhone box had the classic intact plastic film, undoubtedly the iPhone is new and properly functioning like any other iPhone that you buy at the Apple store, great price, I'm satisfied!	1
Obviously for a lot of teenagers this cell phone is a status symbol and there is nothing better. Well I can only say that the seller offered me the chance to save a few euros and, given the cost of the device, this is not at all bad, moreover, it was very punctual and on January 30 the courier delivered the package. I have to object to the courier - in fact I actually did it immediately by calling Bartolini - you can't leave a package of this value in anyone's hands (in this case a neighbor who left it at the door without even ringing !) just for the laziness of ringing a bell and delivering it to the person concerned, he was already doing another delivery! If the package was lost, who would have repaid the product ???? However my son is satisfied and it is a week that he can no longer fiddle ... with my highest disappointment ;-)	1
Excellent product sold and shipped by Amazon. I was wary of buying an iPhone on Amazon but then I convinced myself and bought it and what to say .. perfect! everything went well but please .. make sure the product is sold and shipped from Amazon for added security!	1
Finally our review arrives on the iPhone 7, the first Apple smartphone without audio jack and with the renewed home button, where the design remains the same but iOS 10 is the real beating heart! An important turning point was expected with regard to the design of the new iPhone 7, presented along with the older brother iPhone 7 Plus, during the Keynote of 7/09/2017, but if it were not for the jet black coloring (available only for memory cuts above 32GB) we found ourselves an aesthetically pleasing product equal to its predecessor iPhone 6 / 6s, without audio jack but with a renewed home button and a dual rear camera that we will analyze in the review of the iPhone 7 Plus. These are the main innovations introduced in the iPhone 7 which differs from the 7 Plus just for the absence of the dual rear camera and of the 4.7 ″ Unboxing iPhone 7 retina display HD As any self-respecting product we start by discovering what is hidden inside the packaging of purchase in classic Apple style: Apple iPhone 7 Lightning recharging compartment Headphones with lightning cable 3,5 ″ Audio / Lightning adapter Jack 1Ah wall charger We have seen therefore how the Cupertino company has decided to supply a pair of EarPods headphones with lightning connector as well as a Jack 3.5 adapter to take advantage of accessories and earphones from other brands, headphones not to be confused with the brand new and innovative AirPods, similar to the Samsung Gear Icon X regarding the concept but different in design.But then how will we listen to music? The absence of the audio jack has made many people turn up their nose, but the answer to the above question is very simple. We will have to equip ourselves with Bluetooth devices and since these are now widespread and used for a while, I do not see what the problem is. Thus the audio jack disappears, which apart from personal tastes and opinions actually leaves no room for anything since the grid on the left is purely aesthetic, while the speaker on the right side of the lightning connector provides high audio quality, with balanced highs and deep and full bodied.Remaining in the field of audio, we cannot praise the choice of Apple engineers who have seen fit to integrate an additional stereo speaker under the front camera capable of providing an even more balanced sound even if according to some sources it is only an optimization of the ear capsule. Photos and Selfies even in low light conditionsA good news for selfie lovers comes with this iPhone 7 as they can take pictures even in dark places thanks to the 4.7 ″ display which, when illuminated, turns into a practical and excellent flash retina capable of illuminating foreground the subjects in the foreground that will then be captured in HD resolution thanks to the 7 Megapixel lens. iPhone 6s optics with six elements. Equipped with f / 1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization to shoot videos in 4K, together with the 12 megapixel sensor, it guarantees brighter photos in low ambient light conditions, a feature also favored by the True Tone Flash consisting of 4 iPhone 7 is resistant to water splashes ... But beware of the warrantyOn both new iPhones the IP67 certification is present, so ours is a smartphone resistant to water, dust and sand, even if after spending 800 euros a bit of fear there is always, but at least we can make videos, take pictures or call even in the rain without thoughts ... This was what I thought until I read this informative note on the Apple site that left me somewhat thrilled: "" iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are resistant to water, splashes and dust; they have been tested in the laboratory under controlled conditions, with an IP67 rating according to the IEC 60529 standard. The resistance to water, splashes and dust is not a permanent feature and could decrease with normal wear. Don't try to charge your iPhone when it's wet; consult the manual to clean and dry it.The warranty does not cover damage caused by liquids. "" So my advice is to be careful and consider this as an additional level of protection. Of course, you can safely use it with wet hands or in the rain, but I advise you to avoid immersing it completely or exposing it to the direct jet of water. The touch-sensitive home button: the Home key that despite retaining the Touch ID function, which as we know it serves to unlock the device by scanning the fingerprint or to make payments through Apple Pay, it represents a novelty and a revolution as for the first time in the history of Apple, we are not in front of the classic physical key but one touch consisting of a sensor, called Taptic Engine, capable of measuring finger pressure, in Force Touch style. With a little pressure it therefore returns a tactile feedback, offered by the internal motors and customizable, similar to the physical button. The same function, therefore, but in a body and in a different technology. An intelligent solution if we think that this way we eliminate the problems of malfunction due to wear of the physical key. This does not, however, remove any faults in the internal sensor. In terms of touch and tactile feedback, we cannot fail to mention one of the most interesting innovations offered by iOS 10: The 3D Touch Introduced with iOS 10, the 3D Touch represents an absolute novelty for smartphones from bitten apple and is useful in different circumstances. With a prolonged and profound pressure on the icons of compatible apps we will be able to quickly access the configuration menus as in the case of the native app "Clock" where we can set an alarm or start the timer without opening the application directly. We will be able to preview the content of a website to decide in advance whether to visit it or not, to quickly write a message, an email or a whatsapp etc ... In short, an extra gear and a third dimension of the touch. The product, powered by a 1960 mAh battery and the brand new Quad Core A10 Fusion processor is sold in basic configuration, from 32 GB to 799 euros up to 1019 euros for the full 128 GB model of internal storage in silver, gold, pink gold and Jet Black (Matt Black)	1
I come from Iphone 6 and here we are definitely forward compared to the previous one, with greater fluidity in the applications, excellent camera resolution (12 mega pixels) and the practicality of always Apple devices. The only variation is precisely the absence of the physical home button replaced by one of the same but virtual shape that responds to touch (which can be calibrated). Perfect and timely delivery.	1
The phone speaks for itself, but I must add that after having tried Android and Windows phones for years, I wonder why I waited so long to switch to the iPhone. The higher price is well rewarded by the quality / functionality / usability that other phones dream of. A praise to the seller, who was super willing to give me information before shipping: confirming that the plug is the Italian one and promising to do my best to send the product to me before the scheduled time. The product has in fact arrived the day before the indicated date and conforms to the expectations. Great seller, thank you again.	1
What to say, the Apple brand itself remains a guarantee for buyers. I bought the phone and it arrived 2 days later, fast and efficient shipping. Great phone, working and nothing to complain about. Perfect! 5 stars!! -> https://amzn.to/2JyVl2V	1
No need to add anything else. IPhone 7 is the top of the range. Absolutely number 1. Using the appliance at average daily intensity, I arrive in the evening when I still have 30-40% of the battery. Excellent	1
I bought seeing the positive reviews of the store. I am totally satisfied with both delivery / timing and packaging care. All positive, nothing to complain.	1
Very fast shipping, arrived earlier than expected. Perfect package. The iPhone arrived sealed in its packaging exactly as purchased from the Apple store. Very recommended purchase, also because about 100 € less on an Apple product are really many! On iPhone 7 nothing to say, on the net there are already thousand reviews.	1
I didn't buy it above, but I can guarantee 100% that all the money you would pay for it is worth all, an excellent operating system, one of the best in my opinion, a very good camera and I never had any problems with this phone,	1
Great phone camera almost the top. The battery arrives quietly for the end of the day with normal use if you then activate the energy saving is a bomb obviously the fluidity of an iPhone and its iOS is not discussed perfectly I would review the price a bit but for 128gb this and more	1
in a few tens of minutes (putting the sim and connected to the wifi) it has been updated and has taken all the data from the icloud. Compared to the previous 5s that I have this model is thinner but wider as the screen and the photos and the response to the applications is surprising (it makes very sharp pictures with many shots so you can see the movement and choose the best by itself) not to mention the phone calls and applications that run more smoothly, ECCC	1
I am satisfied with the product that I purchased, still not seen much difference with the front that I had 6s .. I have to familarizzzre more ...	1
Great price. Sold as branded, but there is no trace in the package. Very appreciated gift	1
Phone fully functional, original, excellent reliability AMAZON as always. I can not say anything about the guarantee because so far I have not had problems .. but all ok. And I saved more than 150 euros ...	1
It is not easy, at all, to review the iPhone 7. It is not even after a month of use and after we have begun to master it, the condition that we have always tried to favor when we take a new model in our hands before writing a real review . iPhone 7 is in fact a device that for many aspects confuses all the more if, like us, we are accustomed from the beginning to follow the evolution of the smartphone world of the Apple; in fact, it comes from the classic Apple groove: the one that presented us with a completely new device after a revision of the one launched two years earlier. In the case of the iPhone 7, in contrast to the "rule" we are instead faced with an aesthetically almost identical copy of the iPhone 6s, and for the transitive power of the "s" models, to the iPhone 6. In the same time behind this appearance of a device very similar to the version of three years ago, there are several new ideas and technological leaps, even if only in sketch, very important, able to change the cards on the table of the future Apple. For this reason the temptation to liquidate the review with a "read that of iPhone 6 and season it with the benchmarks that will show a faster and more powerful device" should be put aside, no matter how tempting, just by looking at the device.	1
And I'm so happy !! After breaking my Windows Phone with which I was still fine, I looked for an alternative and after research I convinced myself to try iPhone. Well another world, the apps are all there, the quality is very high, the phone is very nice and I was surprised by the duration of the battery .. I arrive in the evening almost always advancing 30/40% .. Very satisfied !! I would also like to thank the seller for the flawless transaction and lightning shipping !!	1
Inside the box we find a 1A output charger, a USB / Lightning cable, an EarPods headset with Lightning connector and an adapter to use headphones with 3.5mm audio jack ... The design is very similar to that of the iPhone 6 with the exception of the ear capsule, which is larger to also accommodate the second system speaker. The camera is slightly shifted to the left and is now 7 megapixel with stabilization .. The side keys are a little less embedded in the body and the SIM drawer it has a small gasket to protect it from water and dust. The aesthetic differences are more noticeable on the lower part where the 3.5mm audio jack disappears to make room for a mostly aesthetic grid where the main microphone is positioned. The main speaker and the Lightning port remain in place ... Aesthetic novelties also on the back. The separation bands of the antennas have been partially eliminated and the camera has a softer design, protected by a part of the shell. It also improves the flash which is now a Dual Tone 4 LED..iPhone 7 is resistant to water and dust with IP67 certification even if the damages from liquids are not covered by warranty. To offer better resistance, Apple has also redesigned the home button which now it is no longer clickable as usual but is able to recognize finger pressure by offering tactile feedback that we can customize by choosing between three different intensity levels. The button is capacitive and cannot be clicked with objects or if we wear gloves. ... summarizing is a good product and I recommend you will not regret the purchase.	1
Iphone 7: start this brief review on the Iphone 7 declaring me Pro Apple, but absolutely objective and critical. New hardware: the most important hardware novelty is the Home button. Unlike the previous physical key, this simply produces a tactile sensation when pressed. Memory: Unlike the previous models, this is presented with three different memories starting from 32 GB, the 128 GB one and finally the 256 GB one finally said goodbye to the 16GB model. Consequently this implies an increase in prices, the three versions of the iPhone 7 cost distinctly: 799 from 64gb, 909 from 128gb and 1.019euro from 258gb Battery: The battery of this device is clearly improved compared to the previous versions, and in case of use " normal "lasts a whole day quietly. Camera: The rear camera adopts a 12 megapixel resolution as before, with a new 28 mm f / 1.8 aperture lens with optical image stabilizer that takes better and faster photos. More light is captured in the dark and the videos are much more fluid. The flash is less involved in situations of little or poor light, but if this is used it has been clearly improved by giving images with almost natural colors. Without a doubt there is to say that iPhone has always had an excellent camera and 7 continues this tradition with safety. I would like to emphasize for selfie lovers an increase from 5 to 7 megapixels of the front camera, one of the best around right now .Screen: The 4.7-inch diagonal appears to be the same as the previous version, the resolution is also the same as the previous versions, of 750 x 1334, but the wider chromatic gamut .--> This device will most likely be remembered as the phone that "killed" the headphone jack, which in my opinion has clearly improved the sound quality and why not, even the aesthetics on the bottom is in fact a single entry / exit.Inside the packaging there is, the phone 7, charger with cable, EarPod headphones included, which connect via Lightning and an included adapter, which allows you to connect headphones with the jack through the Lightnin port g.In conclusion: I believe that apple has distinguished itself from the other brands due to the details and this time it has given its best. At the same time, however, I think that those who have an iPhone 6s should not spend all this money on an "almost" similar device. I still consider it a top-of-the-range TOP with great capabilities and I don't recommend buying much.	1
The design is basically the same as the iPhone 6 and 6S. So the same since 2014. Is it bad? Only if you consider the aesthetic novelty at all costs a value. What is certain is that the look has something familiar about it, but at the same time the sense of déjà vu is unavoidable: so many models that remind us of iPhones now, some even very pleasant (one for all: the new Honor 8). It is also true that some competitors, Samsung above all, have recovered the stylistic gap with Apple and pushed the frontiers of design further, with new solutions such as 'dual edge' screens, perhaps questionable from a practical point of view but of a sure aesthetic impact. Apple, however, did not stand still. In addition to important interventions "under the hood", in this new generation he worked on materials. Black is the banal color par excellence on a smartphone, but the two shades created for these iPhone 7 are not at all. The matt one is very pleasant, but the 'jet black' (glossy black) is magnificent. It looks like glass to the touch but is aluminum instead, transformed by a complex treatment in 9 steps. The glossy finish attracts fingerprints but less than you might think. Apple warns, however, of the possibility of 'micro abrasions' on the body: in short, the 'jet black' (which cannot be chosen in the basic 32 GB memory cut) is more delicate than the other colors. Another advantage of black iPhones is the virtual disappearance of the black bands for the antennas on the back, still visible (but less intrusive than in the past) in the other three shades of silver, gold and pink. Purists will instead continue to hate the bulb of the camera that protrudes from the body: on the Plus it is now more visible than ever A strength of the iPhone 7 is its resistance to water and dust.	1
I tried carefully the new matt black iPhone 7, so I am ready to write a review, I will try to be as complete as possible! *** BOX *** The design of the package remains unchanged, but the printed image changes: if in that of the 6s was represented the front of the phone, in that of the 7 we find instead the back, which represents the main design difference between the new and old model. We find beyond the phone the wall charger with lightning cable, lightning headphones and the comfortable audio jack to lightning converter, useful if you want to use your old headphones. *** DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION QUALITY *** The design remains unchanged on the front compared to the 6s, but hidden inside the earpiece here is the second speaker, a of the main novelties of this telephone.On the back the plastic bands of the antennas are moved on the margins, it is up to you to decide if you prefer them as they were or as they were before, especially in this model opaque black, they are very pleasant because they are almost invisible, camouflaging themselves with aluminum. Finally the camera changes, which becomes larger, but probably better embedded in the body and less exposed to scratches. *** USE EXPERIENCE ** * iOS 10 is certainly a nice step forward compared to 9, in fact the "" raise to wake up "" feature is very useful which, when we lift the phone from a surface, turns on the screen to be able to unlock it immediately or simply be able to control the time without pressing any key. As you all know, there is no headphone jack, so you will not be able to recharge the phone and listen to music simultaneously if you do not use wireless headphones, sold separately. Slightly improved display and battery, and audio, thanks precisely to the double speaker, it is definitely better. Also changing the home button, which becomes Force touch, is therefore no longer clickable, but when you press it a vibration motor placed next to the button will return you a very pleasant feedback in my opinion, after a short time I assure you that you will get used to it. *** QUALITY / PRICE REPORT AND CONCLUSIONS *** The price of the product is certainly very high, the memory cuts have been doubled, excluding however the 64gb which in my opinion was the best compromise. If you already have the 6s, you will not feel the need to change. Having said that, if you want to have the latest iPhone model you have to spend a lot, and it will always be like this, but you know that you pay for the quality. ** *** FINAL VOTE: 9/10 ***** This was my thought on the new Apple matt black iPhone 7, [...] hello and the next! :)	1
The apple 7 of the apple is a fantastic phone with an incredible camera, a perfectly balanced operating system and a fabulous screen to say the least. The new home button returns a good feed and the absence of the jack is noticeable only for the first few days, afterwards you don't notice its absence.	1
It's a good smartphone, the aesthetics always very faithful to the other versions ... every time I switch to a new version I'm always satisfied	1
Review: Apple iPhone 7 4G Smartphone (Display: 4.7 "" - 32 GB - iOS 10) I state that I used the product for about a week to test it and be able to do a useful review to clarify the merits and defects of the product so as to facilitate your purchasing choices. A week in which I tell you immediately that I have not yet had the courage to give him the "" baby bath ", yes the waterproof telephone still seems to me a bit absurd, anyway from the videos that run they seem to be really resistant to water. UNBOXING The package together with the elegant Iphone 7, contains wall charger with Apple-specific lightning connector, these headphones also with lightning attack and not the classic 3.5mm jack, but the manufacturer has well thought of also inserting an adapter to insert headphones with a 3.5mm jack, of which we are perhaps already in possession and finally present the paper clip to extract the NANO-FIRST IMPACT. Like its predecessors, it is always really beautiful, the unique design that many manufacturers try to imitate and that together with its logo increase the price that may or may not please. 4.7 inches sounds strange when most smartphones are now around 5.5. I personally do not like phones that are too large and 4.7 inches in hand are perfect, you can easily reach every point on the screen without difficulty and without risking the phone to fall. The home button is fixed and overlapping the finger without crushing , as was the case with the previous models, you can "" command "" the phone very simply and with great responsiveness (it will only take a moment to become familiar), I liked this new proposal because one of the things I didn't like it was just the central pushbuttonDimensions of the smartphone: 6.7 x 0.7 x 13.8 cmWith the smartphonebatterybattery: The battery is from 1960 mAh which in numbers may seem few compared to other smartphones but this appears well optimized, the first few days that I had it in my hand and also used intensely to download applications and discover its qualities I managed to go beyond the day and then loading it in the mat tinata.RAM & ROM We start from 2gb RAM. While now everyone is running and inserting Ram from 4 if not 6gb that not even many of the computers on the market today can boast, this smartphone is offered with 2GB of RAM. Sufficient in my opinion, together with the A10 Quad-core Processor, they make the phone work wonderfully, it is very fluid even in the use of the heaviest applications. To also consider then that with the next updates we will surely see improvements also from this point of view. I for the ROM without thinking too much I have chosen the 32 gb version, to me these also seem more than enough.I make my considerations: it seems to me that they try to make us megalomaniacs, we must have space where we can save our photos, videos and generic files. It almost seems that 32 GB are few, even the smartphone with 256 GB of memory ?? woow! who knows if then one day it stops working..it's the end, I could have in my photos and videos since I was a newborn !! I personally prefer to upload files online or on a flash drive so as not to occupy memory and have no problems should stop working the phone. PHOTOS & VIDEOS One of the parts that has convinced me the most is this, and the videos are really exceptional, I also don't have a firm hand and that with other terminals I find it a bit difficult to stand still with this camera I found myself really well, it is very stable even when making videos, all very clean and bright even when they are made in low light. Also in this case then with the updates they will intervene and surely improve the photo-video department. The camera protrudes but with the cover that I think is necessary you solve the problem AUDIO Other part that I liked but God forbid since the producers are back in vogue thanks to the iPod is the audio. Listening to fantastic music thanks to the stereo speakers one in the lower part near the entrance for the lightning cable and one in the upper part of the display and also with nice headphones (I mainly used the ones I already possessed with 3.5mm jack) FINAL CONSIDERATIONS5 stars it seems to me right to give them to this device, yes the price is really high but we know that this is the policy of the manufacturer that charges its terminals with gold weight but it will always be like this and nothing can be done without it that tack on other smartphones. Of course I recommend this phone to anyone with a PC or tablet of the same brand as the connections between the devices are much simpler. If you have the previous model, maybe you can think of it for a moment as there has not been an abyssal change, there is time and with the new updates this smartphone will improve even more. I hope my review has been helpful.	1
Also this time Apple does not disappoint! The best smartphone around ... Always one step ahead of everyone! I am very satisfied with the purchase!	1
I bought my iPhone on amazon but not here in Italy because it is not yet available and I also wanted more memory while this is 32GB, but I wanted to leave my opinion the same. If anyone is interested in knowing how the new iPhone7 takes photos, than at 6 and 6s, I can immediately tell you that they are better and in low light conditions they are clearly better. You can notice an impressive speed in the use and in the answers compared to the 6s, thanks to the new processors. The new opaque black color is really gorgeous, Black looks awesome !!! It's so smooth. There are no lines and it looks like a product all of a piece. I saw the black Jet shiny, it is my favorite color, but it was not available, but I can say that it is a work of art, but it is easier than it is scratches. But most people will use a cover that hides the back so maybe the color isn't that important. I love the new home button, it's took me about 5 minutes to have the same user experience and I can say that I don't miss the old home button. Overall I like it! Fastest device I've ever used. I chose the 128g version and it's perfect in size for everyone. Power Photos and videos a lot of memory, all in just 256g. The fact that it is without headphones does not bother me at all. The adapter works well with my high quality headphones. I tried the same song and with the same headphone using a 6s of a friend and 7 with the adapter and I can't say that there are any differences. The thing I like less is the display is only HD even if the visual quality is wonderful. With IPhone 4.5, 5s, 6 and SE you will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far from speed, but the difference is the same. With IOS 10 there are many new features and some bugs, that you Apple lovers know better than me, but Apple is working to solve them as quickly as possible and then I think that we will have a perfect phone or almost as it has always been with the previous versions of Iphone.If you have other curiosities contact me. Soon I will publish some shots.	1
arrived on time with everything perfect	1
I decided to buy the iPhone 7plus and the cheapest price could only be on Amazon! Given the not inconsiderable amount a bit 'the fear of making such a purchase on the internet there was ... but given the excellent reviews I decided to trust. Well I couldn't make the right choice !! Serious and reliable seller, I received the order even 48 hours later! Original packaging, all new and impeccable, sealed and cellophane. Unique, small, inconvenience: the USB charging cable was missing, even though there was a wall socket, etc. The seller, however, did not hesitate to send me one immediately, although it is clear that it is not an original Apple. But for the price paid and the service I still had, I couldn't ask for better!	1
Given to my wife, fixed by the iPhone by which she had never had so far, having always used Android smartphones. In her opinion, it is a completely different world. of consumption. Personally I am not a great admirer, above all for an absolutely exaggerated cost for this kind of devices. But so much .... Excellent cmq the offer of the seller of Amazon and exceptional the shipment.	1
This model was bought back after it was stolen from me at the hospital! I know it very well and I can't help but praise its undisputed quality. Certainly the most successful before the advent of the X max. I bought it gold for the lowest price, I will cover with a suitable cover!	1
Great product, recommended for those looking for a phone that guarantees high daily standards. Of course, no problem whatsoever is ever blocked. Excellent display, excellent camera, battery lasts one day if under stress, two days with normal use of 3-4 hours a day. The only flaw, but not his fault, is the cloud storage space, only 5GB for all Apple products. For those who need it, of course, they can buy more space, but 5gb free are a bit few	1
On Apple we waste rivers of words, or, we love or hate it .. I hate it, but I took the phone for the good price since I have to make an important gift .. let me thank the seller for his courtesy and promptness in responding to emails and sending the invoice requested by me late .. I recommend the seller and of course those who like Apple the price is great	1
I purchased this product to replace an old iPhone model. I didn't want to spend too much to have a more or less recent model opting for the 7 instead of 8. The passage was evident especially in terms of graphics and battery life. The product is Apple: comfortable and intuitive. Arrived well packed and complete with everything; quick also on the invoice request.	1
iPhone according to my experience number one afrontandon of the other smartphones #! To my experience that I have used malt so much smartphone but minpiacito of more dubtatissma thing	1
The product arrived earlier than expected and packed very well indeed. I highly recommend it, and now after this review I enjoy my 7 plus. The top digital realm, good buy at all, Apple always ahead of everyone	1
I ordered an iphone 7 plus from 32 new, it is really supendo I recommend it to everyone, amazon as always consegane always punctual and perfect boozing. The battery life unlike other old generation iPhones lasts a full day of intense use without problems, obviously the first few days of use with one hand is not very comfortable to use due to its rather large dimensions but it's worth it for one screen so defined and beautiful then slowly takes the habit even with the use with one hand ..	1
The product arrived working and complete with accessories, with option sold and shipped by Amazon. The Italian warranty is present by entering the product code on the Apple website. It works, no problem whatsoever. Very beautiful display and photos. For the complete specifications of Ip 7 plus and iOs see online. Recommended if you do not want to spend a thousand euros for new iPhones, but you want something still up to date is more affordable than Apple.	1
Nothing to add to a well-known product. Bought to replace a beloved Nokia 830 but not supported by Microsoft, I needed a product with great battery and compatibility at an honest price for the value of the product.	1
It's an iPhone, so simplicity and power characterize it ... My model is 128gb and is the most suitable for those who want computer independence or other ... now with ios11 the phone flies and I don't feel the need to take the 8	1
EXCELLENT PRODUCT, I HAD WRITTEN A NEGATIVE REVIEW, ONLY THAT I CANNOT CANCEL IT ... HAVING CLARIFIED WITH THE SELLER, WHICH EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO ME, IT'S ALL SOLVED NOW. CONGRATULATIONS TO THE SELLERS AND I EXPECT ME FOR THE OLD REVIEW.	1

All perfect	1
ok	1
I promise it is my first iPhone and Apple product, I can say that at the moment I am satisfied with it in continuous use it can be done from 8 hours up to even 10 hours less use even more than half a day, after about a month I can not but be satisfied I have not noticed malfunctioning for luck, the only thing of a few days ago is that being that they didn't put the jack attack I thought that the audio went in both the boxes below instead I noticed that in the left case it is not used but the crate above calls is used very bizzar things from Apple! 128gb are very recommended they don't fill up right away and you can put music photo app without problems. I recommend the seller Bacom where I made the purchase. Great price is very fast on shipping!	1
I'm not here to talk about Apple or iPhone. But I only bring my testimony that yes, the phone is original and not a copy, if you are skeptical I can assure you that you can trust. I bought the 7 plus and arrived in 1 days with Italian post office. Packing ok. The phone is fully functional. Buying it here saves a lot of money compared to Apple store or any other retailer so why not? Great customer satisfaction purchase	1
There is little to say: splendid product. A truly deserving top of the range (as always, prices are sky-high, even though I saved a lot of money from this supplier). For all the technical details you already know how to search online. Infinite battery	1
One of the best products on the market, fast, reliable and a scary screen. Super recommended for all Apple lovers.	1
The phone is the best iphone ever, compared to the predecessor the photo quality has improved a lot. Great battery life even with heavy use. Even the audio quality is much improved.	1
I bought the iPhone to give a gift and both I and the person who received it were satisfied. Beautiful product, undamaged package, fast delivery times and great price	1
Very satisfied with the purchase. In addition to having purchased at a very competitive price compared to the official sales channels and the most famous commercial chains, this iphone plus is definitely more reactive, capacious and the battery is very powerful. The storage of 32 GB is enough for me. I recommend the purchase for those who have no particular capacity requirements.	1
Excellent terminal, flawless operating system. Good battery life, fast and reliable companion. Excellent photos and display brightness	1
I purchased an iphone 7 plus 128 gb from this seller. The product is new and with charger Italy. I wanted to dwell more on the product, on the seller ... Immediate his answers to meet my needs (he replied to emails also Sunday), and very fast on shipping 2 days from order and I had the phone in hand. Really excellent and impeccable.	1
Punctual shipping and perfect product, I recommend buying a cover and a tempered glass immediately because the back shell gets scratched before you can pay attention to it!	1
Perfect iPhone 7 plus, packed well enough and in its original packaging with every original accessory! Great purchase for those who want to switch to IOS.	1
It was the first time I made such an important purchase on Amazon and I must say that I was super happy. The phone arrived two days in advance, all packaged to perfection with a guarantee seal. The phone was in its original cellophane. I highly recommend purchases from this supplier.	1
.... it is from version 4 that I married the apple and every time it seems to me impossible to improve the last series .... yet this time too it has separated the 6s plus by two lengths. Excellent product, excellent yield, excellent battery and decidedly pleasant innovations (absence of the home button and double camera) which in my opinion are not a facade but substantial. I also recommend it as an upgrade from the 6s plus because it's worth it anyway.	1
Satisfied at 101% On the characteristics of the device itself I will not express myself as they are readily available. Item arrived even earlier than expected without any damage. I highly recommend the seller OK INFORMATICAP.S. The cover you see in the picture I ordered obviously of course!	1
Telephone in silver version: beautiful. Fluid, powerful, etc., etc. I will not go into the praise here, for more details there are specialized sites. My first iPhone ... maybe it won't be the last. Fast shipping, arrived on schedule. Great!	1
My review does not of course concern Apple who does not need comments. Rather I must say that the service provided by Regno Digitale is truly exceptional. It is the third iPhone I buy and the service in all cases was fabulous. The whole package is perfectly sealed ... very fast shipping in just two days. Contacted several times seller for my doubts and questions and every time I received fast and comprehensive answers. Everything perfect ... thanks	1
In my opinion the phone 7 plus is the best product ever. Big enough, finally the battery lasts more than a full day with intense, fast and robust usage. I wouldn't change it with any other smart at the moment. Amazon delivery as always excellent fast times, perfect product packaging.	1
Phone that needs no comment, I had an iPhone 6, but this is really incredible. Apart from the 5.5 inches, I use it to really do everything, excellent camera, excellent battery life, excellent screen and excellent browsing speed. Impeccable Amazon delivery, I would have preferred a better packaging, knowing the couriers ..	1
Excellent purchase, 32gb version paid only € 709.00 in July 2017The product does not need reviews. The only comment you can make is on the shipment: the one I ordered was shipped from Germany, so it took more than one week to arrive. But given the price, this did not affect the valuation	1
I was very skeptical about taking iPhone 7plus on the internet for fear it wouldn't come or maybe it was a scam, I read positive reviews and wanted to try. Delivery in advance (thankfully because I was without a telephone). Well what to say at the moment all positive.	1
I would say that it has nothing different from the one purchased in the store or the app store. Arrived on time and never gave problems	1
Very nice I took it again but it was practically new	1
arrived in perfect condition it was for my mother and has with the phone almost a year and wonderfully recommended	1
excellent and functional is fine and to recommend	1
I think there is nothing to say .... just perfect. immediately synchronized with my mac book air without having to do anything	1
As usual, iPhone is exceptional with the memory capacity of a portable device with everything you keep in a Mac. Thanks to the seller NeoPhonia	1
Excellent, the original apoare orodotto, perfectly packaged with all u suou accessories !!!! incredible the price difference with the official channels !!! even if with hyper discounts we get closer !!! good	1
It's my third Apple phone and I can only reconfirm my love for this brand! The merchant was very fast both in shipping and in sending the item.	1
Excellent purchase. perfect product at a decidedly competitive price. Original sealed packaging complete with accessories. I opted for the plus model with some concern for the dimensions but I confirm that the product is definitely usable even with one hand and the battery after 14 hours of use is still at 40%.	1
iPhone 7 Plus 128gb, it's wonderful. I went from 6S to 7 Plus and I must say that having these gems in your hands is wonderful! Thanks to the seller Bacon, synonymous with warranty like Amazon.	1
On the product there is nothing to say and those who know the phone (almost half the population) can tell me what I'm talking about. I give a very positive review of the fast and available buying service. Congratulations indeed, lately I prefer to buy online than on the pdv.	1
Fast delivery, sooner than expected, which is essential since my iPhone 6 left me on foot and I needed a phone in a very short time. I was undecided whether to try Android as an alternative but I didn't have the courage to abandon the eco system that works great. Fast it is qualitatively excellent. What I expected.	1
Phone arrived in the original sealed box and in turn inserted into a cardboard box is surrounded by paper to avoid shocks.Neophonia sent immediately: telephone ordered on Thursday and arrived on Monday (would have arrived Saturday but the courier was closed). All perfect	1
I switched to this model after a couple of years of the iPhone 5S. The iPhone 7 Plus has a screen with an excellent resolution, big enough to make it easy to watch a movie. At the same time, the phone is thin and despite its large size, it is handled quite easily and fits in your pocket without problems. The camera (12 mega pixels) excellent, with zoom takes excellent photos. The processor is powerful, fast and offers massive responsiveness in all conditions. Another implementation took place in the home button: the iPhone 7 does not have a real button but a kind of reactive touch sensor. Every time this "" virtual "button is pressed, the cell phone transmits a small, very pleasant vibration; so much so that it seems to have a "live" instrument in your hands. " The battery has been implemented in a sensitive way: even with intense use, you get to the end of the day without problems. The device is now non-underwater, but at least water resistant. In short, as many have already pointed out, apparently the mobile phone is very similar to the previous models; in reality in daily use we realize the many small and big improvements that Apple has made. It is always the same product, in short, but refined to achieve excellence. However, at least one mistake Apple did it with this model: eliminate the standard attack to use headphones. In this way, either you use the Apple headphones (already adapted) or you need to have a small jack (included, but easy to lose) to adapt the headphones to the attack. Apart from that, we have a cell phone with a high cost (we are around 1,000 euros at full price) but to which you can find very few weak points.	1
I have been using this smartphone for 3 months, after having owned, over the years, several other models (iPhone, 3s, 5, 5s and 6), some with contracts and other companies. As always, the convenience of telephone company offers that can reduce purchase costs should be carefully checked. My opinion is that the 7 plus, for general quality, justifies the fact of having to carry a very large phone in your pocket and / or handbag (photo compartment, screen, audio without headphones are better than all the predecessors; the battery lasts very long, often if I don't use it intensely for video it lasts me even two days). It's comfortable in my hand, I often use it with a hand to write, it's well balanced. I do not regret not having taken the smallest model but personally I would not go back; the price difference is quite large, but in absolute terms, given what those who can afford the iPhone7 can spend a little more and take this, it's worth it (from the price list it costs about 15% more than the model -plus). I find it obviously very powerful, very fast for all the functions in which I used it ... and God forbid! I have never used headphones very much, so I can't judge the goodness of removing the jack, nor the practicality of this choice: but I remember when Apple took away the optical reader from the Macbook and everyone shouted at the scandal ... The telephone section is perhaps the least satisfactory one: the voice is clear but a little metallic, so much so that if you put the speakerphone on or the headphones change not only volume but also timbre. Nothing inexcusable but still noteworthy, a feature that did not happen with previous models. Very good reception, instead, everywhere. Excellent certified resistance to water and dust. This offers both greater tranquility in use (the phone is always with us: in your pocket when it rains, near the sink when we cook, unfortunately sometimes even at the table while we eat ... and a little water or other liquids sooner or later it can rain on it, even if it is obvious that this is not a sub phone) it is more tranquility in case of malfunction, because the warranty applies to all cases where before they could dispute that the phone had been wet. Price consideration. The price is very high: from the Apple list € 939, € 1049 and € 1159 for the 32 models (unusable in my opinion) 128 and 256 GB: however on Amazon it varies a lot and you have to buy only if there are no other offers cheaper in around, check it out! However, it is known, a very expensive phone: this is the Apple policy, take it or leave it. I gave 5 stars despite a price that for "pure" technical content is very high, as always at Apple. The consideration on the price is important for everyone, but for me I know that I will use this tool at least 4 hours a day, every day, for at least a year or maybe two: I will have all the time to amortize the costs - I who am always been satisfied with Apple, using a smartphone every day that is, for my needs, the state of the art.	1
It met expectations	1
Excellent, arrived new sealed with warranty. Simply wonderful	1
Then the phone arrived within the expected time frame 48 h, sealed as new with all the accessories intact inside, also sealed with lots of film as if purchased from the store; it lights up well it charges the battery well I would say that at the moment it is more than fine it has no scratch, it is in excellent condition! The only thing seems to me a little slow in installing the applications and transcribing from the old everything but I will certainly not give a star in less because for me it is fine so considering that the level of cost is also a great deal, then iPhone is always iPhone I had doubts in the purchase online but I am very very satisfied! Arrived between the other yesterday so if you have any problems later I will write for sure	1
I bought this iPhone for my mother because I was tired of the various malfunctions of Android devices and because I only use iPhone. Although the device is reconditioned the battery is perfect, the only thing that differentiates it from a new iPhone is a small scratch on the body but practically invisible. My mother has been using it for a couple of weeks but found no problems. Arrived on time!	1
I didn't know the store and I used it for the first time, as it offered the best price for my iPhone 6s I was looking for. The expedition has anticipated the scheduled time of 2 days despite having made the purchase on Friday evening. In conclusion all was perfect, the site is excellent, the only drawback is the lack of telephone contact.	1
Well what about the product is perfect, it arrived sealed in the original packaging with lots of adapter for the Italian sockets. The phone has no scratches or malfunctions, so a good buy.	1
High quality device, you may like it or not, but it's an iPhone 6s. If one buys it, with that he has what he wants. With Prime no nasty surprise, and I confirm that it is brand new, packaged and sealed, all as it should be.I made for a friend (I am more Android oriented, but so much so), until now I have not yet pulled it back, so I assume it's okay.	1
Product arrived safely and on time. Given the price I was a little worried that it was reconditioned, instead it arrived new and with original cellophane.	1
The delivery was precise and punctual with everything a courier can offer for a smooth delivery. The product is very good and in excellent condition. I have been using it for 8 days and its performance is very good so far.	1
Everything works correctly! The device is new not reconditioned. Headphones and charger are present. Being original it arrives in its packaging with the transparent plastic and the two apple stickers inside. Unfortunately, my first order was lost by SDA, but with the skill of the Amazon team, it sent me a new iphone that arrived after only 2 days !Awesome!	1
What to say is an iPhone 6s that already knows its functionality and how it works. Shipping has arrived punctually and fast the product is obviously good and the pink color is really very beautiful.	1
Perfect!!! All new and incelofanato .. new accessories and chargers with Italian plug! Nothing to say everything perfect and great price! Also arrived quite a bit earlier than expected!	1
Arrived in perfect condition and also ahead of schedule. Everything works perfectly and everything matches the description.	1
Excellent smartphone, ultra thin and with quality finishes, the display has the right dimensions for a light and handy palmtop. Very good value for money, received very quickly	1
The phone is very performing. Beyond the shipping problems (to be attributed to the chosen courier) it must be said that the supplier has shown efficiency in fulfilling the order and preparing a package suitable for a safe shipment. Complements to Technical Service	1
Iphone arrived as a description given to my friend for the super enthusiastic birthday one of the few new and pink iphone left! Excellent fast and reliable !!!	1
Arrived sealed in its Apple box with all accessories lower price than the stores	1
Excellent purchase, iPhone is always a good machine. The shipping times have been respected even if in full period of Christmas holidays. The battery lasts a lot anyway.	1
Everything corresponds to what I expected. But above all it was the speed and precision in the delivery that solved a big problem I had!	1
More than good. For my financial resources and considering that it is intended for an 11-year-old girl it is super. In this context I am more than satisfied.	1
Perfect product, highly recommended to all apple lovers! Above all the quality of the photos is really great! The pink color is delightful, very comfortable and easy to handle.	1
Purchased for my daughter. Satisfied. Accurate packaging. Arrived early.	1

It's great	1
This jewel of Apple certainly needs no introduction. Really top performance, Updated to iOS 9.3.1 the system does not seem to have any problems, apart from some minor flaws here and there like all systems on the other hand. The model ordered by this retailer (Lizard Technologies Di Antonio Buono) mounts the processor A9 produced by TSMC and not the one manufactured by Samsung (look at Telefonino.net review on youtube). Joint product with perfect packaging. The retailer asked me (after requesting an email invoice) to leave approval and advice on how to improve the service offered. Well, a serious and punctual reseller, you cannot improve what is already excellent.	1
I will not dwell on widely-treated technical aspects. I was able to compare it with other tops of gammi and the 6s is really remarkable. The product arrives in its box with Italian battery charger, earphones included. European Guarantee 2 years. Thin, light, fast, great photos, beautiful rose gold color (I like it too). Avoid the 16Gb version, as the space for apps / photos / videos / documents is too little. I haven't tried the 7 yet, but at the moment the 6s is the best iphone around.	1
I was skeptical about buying this phone because of the low price that nobody else has, but in the end reading the reviews and looking like the most reliable retailer, I decided, and I did very well. The phone comes in its original box with all the accessories, it's perfect, arrived in just two days, original and works perfectly. Reliable and serious shop!	1
Well, what to say. We always talk about the flagship phone from Apple. A concentration of technology, power as well as style. The 5 stars are really deserved. Unparalleled fluidity and reliability. Surely it is not a valid upgrade but for me who came from an iPhone 4s the improvement is substantial!	1
Beautiful iphone especially in this new rose gold color. Functionality close to brother 6, which however weighs much more than it!	1
arrived quickly before the scheduled date, it was the gift for the confirmation of my niece who was really enthusiastic, really beautiful	1
like all iPhones, excellent functionality - a clear improvement in terms of photos and other various improvements such as switching on via a personalized touch.	1
Super fast service, my fantastic iPhone arrived in two days in excellent condition in the original box with all the accessories (headset and charger)! Truly reliable shop!	1
Perfect phone arrived on time. Apple never disappoints, and I found this model, coming from a significantly higher 4s. Light, wide and clear screen, Siri more precise and versatile. You won't go wrong	1
Iphone original, beautiful color, the seller sells it at a lower price than the big chains for which it's worth it. I really recommend it	1
Arrived earlier than expected, complete with all accessories and is new. It works great	1
New and perfectly packed phone	1
Compliant product	1
Beautiful	1
New iPhone in perfect working order, responding to the description and characteristics. Competitive price compared to the market average. Fast delivery and on time. The only drawback: there is no accompanying document for the purposes of warranty and possible maintenance.	1
Given to my girlfriend for Christmas, she arrived new in her original packaging and in advance of the expectation given by amazon. Even today, it has not shown any signs of malfunctioning, so I would recommend it to anyone who wants an Apple smartphone, but at the same time, for the daily use he has to do, he doesn't want to spend a fortune.	1
iPhone arrived on schedule and in excellent packaging, obviously it's an iPhone and you know all its features. The best I can say is that so far he has never had problems and I hope he continues to endure!	1
Iphone 6s is a great device, supports the latest versions of iOS and the technology is still far from defined as outdated. Small dimensions. Light. Good autonomy. Nice display. At an affordable cost. Product imported from Amazon, not European. Original and complete packaging. All perfect.	1
Original product and conform to the description. Iphone black and silver, 16Gb, complete with headphones and battery charger. Serious and kind seller. Recommended.	1
The smartphone is brand new, the battery is going great at the end of the day I always have about 80% of remaining charge. Sold directly by Amazon there is nothing to say that great product.	1
Absolutely affordable the price and reliable seller. European socket and packaging perfectly intact. Free shipping even if it was not raw, arrived 4 days earlier than expected! The phone does not waste comments because obviously it is one of the best as well as my favorite phone in circulation! When you have it you notice the difference with the others.	1
Fast delivery (3 days), perfect phone both aesthetically and technologically. I will update the review if it causes problems in the future. For now highly recommended.	1
It's how it should be! Amazon never contradicts itself for what it is for! ... and the phone is exactly as it should be, a reliable Apple!	1
Product perfectly in line with the description. It works very well with a really competitive price-quality ratio. I can say I am very satisfied!	1
Excellent quality Apple works great	1
I liked the price. And didn't like the battery life.	1
Really nice phone. Arrived punctually correctly packaged. Satisfied	1
Really a wonderful product that as I expected it did not disappoint me. I speak from Apple enthusiast that despite this, loves to try android products and I say that it is really wonderful, PHOTOS that are made really well, very defined and without seeing too much software intervention; the 12 megapixels are enough and advancing, the only negative note I have seen making a video in a poorly lit environment is that the video will be very dark. The DIMENSIONS in my opinion are perfect, I do not have big hands and therefore phones like the plus and the s7 edge remain huge, so I think this is the perfect size, made even more enjoyable in everyday use by small software implementations such as the double tap on the central button that lowers the whole screen allowing you to reach the highest points (function that I prefer over to the android that gets the entire screen of the phone smaller, because after having made our selection the screen will return to the default size). A wonderful screen that does not regret for anything screens with higher pixel density or more vivid colors.TOUCH 3D. ... nice feature, but for now, in addition to not yet being integrated in all applications, it remains secondary in my opinion .... I almost never used it a, perhaps because of the habit of not doing it, but in some games and programs I noticed that it came back really useful for some functions. BATTERY really good, more long-lived than old iPhones but also superior in duration to products like Galaxy s6 edge or s7 edge . The rest is always Apple, there are those who love it and there are those who hate it but unquestionably the optimization is the best that can be found united with the usefulness of the Apple ecosystem for those who use products of this brand. / 10	1
Fantastic. After numerous Android smartphones and a Windows phone, I decided to switch to Apple. Having already experience on ipad2 I could not confirm the excellent Apple product in all, material quality and operating system. What can I say, high price but excellent product. Another planet.	1
I bought this smartphone from cellularem .... it arrived late with respect to the scheduled dates but the seller gave me all the necessary equipment to track the shipment and the product arrived including everything ... plus there was the receipt for the any warranty and a film for the belly	1
Great product. Very fluid and never jams. Comes safely at the end of the day with normal use. The value for money and review pk would lower a bit the price though for 128gb this and more and then the nice thing about the phones and that with iOS never slow down.	1
All perfect	1
I like it	1
I gave the phone to my mother. His first smartphone. It was love at first sight. In fact, even if the model is a bit dated, it has a simplicity of use typical of apple products, and the paradigm change is very simple!	1
It is a very functional phone and for the price / quality ratio, very accessible. With reference to when it was launched on the market the price is halved and for a person who is not too demanding who does not look to fashion in my opinion is more than enough.	1
I only use the i-phone because I have always found it very well. This that arrived in time by Prime is fantastic and did not disappoint. I think the price is ok.	1
Truly exceptional this Apple iPhone 6S PLUS! Although dated, of 2015, it has all the numbers to still compete with the most modern, if you don't go after innovations like those of activating the iPhone with a look and taking you away 1350.00 euros, see IPhone X, and you need a large display, be sure that with this you will not have disappointments. activation via ICloud immediate curve without losing your data, as soon as activated the update to be done arrives. Note the camera in 4K 30fps a 5.5 display I stop here for technical information, found everywhere. I preao the 6S Plus precisely for the dispay I use it as a monitor for my DJI drone and also for astronomical nights with the app. for the sky. The phone comes sealed Apple original in a beautiful box that contains; ilLibretto, the exceptional headset, the charger, the lever for the Sim door, the Apple Apple stickers. Given the size of the display, the larger the more there is the possibility of lines, I recommend putting the slide and protecting the phone with a cover. Very bad the seller, sent 10 days before, good communication, accurate. Very satisfied, I have other IPad and IPhone, I highly recommend also for the great price.	1
the 6s plus is my third iphone already possessing a 6 plus and having also had an iphone 4. i find that the iphone's are unsurpassed as quality and as an intuitive operating system, unlike the android i got to try and they have me a lot disappointed. so I am delighted with this further choice of an Apple product. the 6s plus camera is superior to the already remarkable good quality of the 6 plus.	1
No malfunctions and perfect conditions, complete with all original accessories.	1
It was a replacement for a defective phone .. !!! Return and refund of the same punctual and precise .. !! this is perfect .. !!	1
Everything arrived with order and precision. Perfectly packed. Original new product never used in more than perfect conditions. New product unobtainable and at a great price. Amazon warranty as always. Extraordinary.	1
Great. Arrived quickly and the product met my expectations.	1
Simply wow	1
I have been using this phone for a few weeks and have not encountered any problems. The screen is great, even though it is not a new model, it is very fast and practical. Advice the seller, precise and punctual.	1
What to say is an iphone	1
The only flaw is the weight but on the other hand the battery is powerful and the dimensions are not reduced. For the rest it fully satisfies for now	1
Many reviews here make the product or seller bad. That's why I have to comment now. I've dared to buy this iPhone. And I'm very satisfied. It was just a shame that the longed for iPhone was not delivered on the announced date. "Order it in the next 45 min Goods to get done. " The iPhone did not come the next day, but the next. Well. Since you can see over it weg.Da some have written that it was a different smartphone than ordered, or even with the wrong serial number, I was skeptical. Everything checked. Everything ok. An iPhone was delivered as ordered. Serial numbers fit on the box as well as on the iPhone. Memory size and color auch.Das iPhone is a European iPhone.The leaflet is also in German.Also do not be afraid. You can buy here cheaper than Apple directly a very good phone. I hope I can some of the fear to buy a cheaper iPhone here.	1
Like so many others, I had some concerns about what the handling would do. Could I get used to the missing homebutton ?! I can reassure everyone, it ran automatically after 1-2 hours! The home button is missing garnicht.Ansonsten kit distance is the best device I've ever had! Photos and videos are outstanding! Face ID even works in the evening light and also with sunglasses and cap! In addition, ch had to think about the silver Alurand, which now shines instead of brushed as before. That looks very high quality and feels good! High price, but justified	1
I'm not sure why there are some reviews that say that the phone is not original because it is and even before I received it Amazon sent me the serial code (which you can, of course, check online to see if it is valid). Came in the perfect packaging and it is exactly what Apple advertises it. Amazon is an authorized reseller for Apple and it makes no sense that this phone would not be original. Regarding the phone itself, it is an excellent phone with an awesome camera. I upgraded from the iPhone 8 plus and I'm really happy with it. If you have any cloud service subscription the 64gb are more than enough.	1
What can I say. After 4 years with an iPhone 5s, I switched to an iPhone XS 256 GB (space gray) for Christmas. I'm still thrilled every time I pick up the iPhone. Since I can currently report nothing negative, I would like to highlight a few things that particularly inspire me: - the display is a single treat - the camera quality is really outstanding. On the iPad, the pictures look even better than on the iPhone display.- the performance is really impressive. Everything runs so smoothly-Face ID works perfectly with me. Whether in complete darkness, with / without glasses, with / without beard ... Can not confirm the negative impressions of other users in any way - Speed ​​in the WLAN and LTE network partly much better than the iPhone 5sNach just over a month, I can still However, this is better than expected, in the run-up to this was not known as a great strength of the XS. Despite the high price, I would immediately buy the iPhone XS again. Especially if you come from a 5s you're just overwhelmed in every way. So I can fully recommend the iPhone XS.	1
I like the iPhone Xs very much. Only it has a very high price. Nevertheless, I bought this for a Samsung S9 Plus replacement. I love this IOS and Android can do what you want, they can not be used against the IOS. Even if a Huawei P30 Pro now has a better camera, I still opted for the iPhone XS although I'm a photographer. As good as the mobile pictures are today to day (in portraits), but if you look at these on an iMac times and the image is zoomed in (zoom in), but you can see the stark differences between a SLR camera and a smartphone. For the 0815 hobby clerk or teen who wants to make a selfie quickly and this post with Insta and co, the cell phone cameras are enough. Since it really does not matter which smartphone the upper class one takes. For me, the decisive factor is the IOS operating system and of course the almost 5 years long updates in IOS where an Android simply can not keep up (mostly Android only 2 years updates).	1
The delivery was faster than announced, proper packaging, goods were in original packaging (Apple) welded and showed no damage. As always with apple: turn on phone, restore backup and continue there incl. The whole apps news, etc. `` where I left off the old phone, it is so easy, Apple just .... :) :) :)	1
Apple"" - Name is enough. I am in love with my new iPhone XS, totally satisfied. I bought on Christmas Time. So I got an amazing discount on it. Best iPhone ever, but a little more heavy than expected. Delivery time of Amazon is also good during Holidays.	1
What should I say that has not already been said. I bought it because of the larger display and good camera. The sensor of the camera should be 30% larger. Pictures are great, especially those that come directly from the Kemera, was important to me. Portrait works as it should, clearly there are here and there wrong representations on the edge of the glasses or hair, but I think it was the best iPhone could deliver. But I'm also on the high level here, as I'm a hobby photographer. Otherwise, it keeps what it promises and I'm thrilled.	1
Great phone! The camera is awesome, the sound of the iPhone is great! I had before the iPhone 7 and I have to say the conversion without a home button, I did not think bad, the Face ID detects even if the light is off or scarf and hood. The only negative thing that bothers me a bit is that it is a little harder as other phones. Since I'll buy such a bobbl for my phone so my fingers do not suffer when I hold the phone in my hand. Everything else great !!	1
Working fine and feels good to hold  Highly recommended	1
Absolute TOP product. I switched now after 4 years from the 6th to the XS. WORLDS difference of course. Photo quality of madness. OLED display stunning. Only the bright stainless steel frame bothers me personally, as it shows quite quickly first micro-scratches.	1
Switched from an iPhone SE. What a great device the XS is! Compared to the Samsung S9, this is really the ultimate. Face ID works great. Photos are beautifully beautiful. And with this device it will also be fun to play a game on it. Totally happy with it!	1
After 3 months in use, I have to say ... everything is great, just like you're used to from Apple. Previously only had Samsung phones and now the i phone. Best decision I could make. Anyone may have any concerns when switching from android to iOSSuper provider fast delivery	1
Finally, my first ever iPhone. I always wished to have one but the crazy prices of these iPhones never justified to get one. This year I couldn't refrain myself because this gorgeous, bloody, future proof iPhone XS forced me to spend this hefty amount at last. Its a luxury device with unmatched performance and I'm sure I'd never switch back. It's way much pricy, to be honest, I'll never recommend buying unless you're a die heart fan of this beast(like me) but I promise you'll never regret your purchase(aside from money).	1
There are already countless reports and tests, but I would like to address two points. For some time, the missing home button and face ID has stopped me from buying. After only a few days, I definitely do not miss the home button. The operation of the iPhone succeeds without as simple and supple, as it is used by Apple.Face-ID works so fast and accurate, that one immediately asks how it could only withstand as long as with the fingerprint sensor.	1
once iPhone always iPhone, cool part,	1
My Windows Phone Lumia 950 was "out of order". I'll miss .... Android is out of the question for me.So Apple iPhone XS (64 GB) - Space Gray ... Excellente photos etc ..	1
It's great, but too expensive. Really annoying, I find that Apple renounces more and more connections. There is no mini-jack headphone input anymore. Either you have to buy an adapter, or Apple accessories ...	1
+ Very good camera and possibilities for image processing Very good display Very intuitive user interface + New feature FaceID works very well and simplifies operation	1
Ok	1
Apple - what else! all right, the price has held me back a little, but - if you have an Iphone, you have an iPhone	1
I just love it. Mega fast and mega quality. That's why I love iPhones.	1
Everything was perfect. I would definitely buy it again if I needed one.	1
I was also a bit skeptical because the recommendations were very different, from one can not use to the wrong product. My iPhone was working fine with me and I was able to put it into operation and use it as well. Therefore, I am completely satisfied.	1
It's the 3rd Apple product in our family! That actually says everything about our appreciation for the quality of the products. Even a purchase in Dubai we did not notice there despite some cheapening.	1
You can call	1
perfect Handy.liegt beautifully in the hand, has a very good Kamera.die face recognition even works with sunglasses	1
Think there is not much to say, only that you have 2 years warranty at Szon	1
Like the most of apple products, this one makes no exception for the quality.  The price is a bit too high. It works great and I started to get along with the new features, I had an iPhone 6S+ before.I still miss the fingerprint scanner/home button, but it is ok	1
Fast delivery great product	1
The product is very easy to set up when your previous phone is an iPhone. This iPhone comes with a great doble camera. The size is also an improvement as it is larger than the older models but not as large as the plus version.	1
Best picture ever	1
Again and again.	1
You do not really have to say much about it. Super processed. I am very pleased.	1
As expected.	1
I like everything in this phone. It is little pricy, but quality costs, and quality can be felt once you start using iPhone Xs.	1
Nice device and fast	1
it's a bit heavy rather than other products available from other brands, the quality of the speakers, photo, etc.. is really good	1
s.o.	1
There is no better smartphone currently	1
Fast	1
I like the product of everything it is just perfect only on the price you could change something	1
No words needed.	1
Arrived quickly, easy to setup and had no problems	1
Fits comfortably in your hand.	1
Everything fits	1
Everything is perfect.	1
Everything Top	1
Very well	1
fit	1
Hello dear Amazonler! Today I review the iPhone XS in the 256 GB version in black / space gray. I have received it because of my upcoming contract extension. Before I used an iPhone 7 Plus 128 GB in black / space gray. I could have already extended my contract at that time, when the iPhone 8 or X came out. But since I had the iPhone 7 Plus and I had the added value of upgrading to the iPhone 8 was missing, and I was with the technique of the iPhone X (Face ID) is not 100% convinced it was initially in a pure tariff extension with a smaller Laufzeit.Als but I was increasingly confronted with the iPhone X (family, friends, etc. ) I was once curious how the technology works behind it and I finally decided to renew with the iPhone XS. Now to the device, the device is slightly smaller than my iPhone 7 Plus, but has just more "" Netto "" -Bildschirmfläche. For my taste, just the right size now, since the iPhone 7 Plus is always "" big "" but not "too big", but was somehow unwieldy, hard to describe (and I already have very big hands !). The device itself comes, as you know, WITHOUT homebutton. What was the most incomprehensible in the world for me, because how else to serve the device? And how sophisticated is the Face-ID story? I was quickly taught a better one. The device itself can be used excellently (!!!) without homebutton. Just when I attached one of the SPIGEN armored glass foils, I realized that even without the recess at the bottom of the home button, there is much less potential for dirt. Furthermore, you will notice that much is explained during the initial setup, like the device "" now "" is to use and much on the respective gestures is received.Thus, Face-ID is established relatively quickly and this works very well. The unlock is fast and with a wipe you are on the homescreen. The handy feature of Face-ID is that it is already compatible with many apps and you save the annoying password after the one-time password and approval for using the Face-ID then just - I think that's really great, because it is so much easier and faster to his Apps / Login kommt.Face-ID also works in the "" extreme test "" yet. With sunglasses it has unlocked 3 / 5x, with "" fake beard "" always 5/5 times (I think here then the eyes are scanned or something). So the technology behind it really recognizes striking aspects and balances them systematically. The new gestures include, among other things, a swipe down to pull the upper part of the screen "down" (but must be set ---> activate one-handed operation) Swipe from the bottom to the top and then to the page to get to (and close) the apps you've opened. Holding down the "" off "" button for a few seconds to activate Siri, as well as simultaneously pressing the "" Louder "" and "Off" button for a screenshot. Homebutton itself to homebutton "" has taken me 1 hour (to learn the gestures) so it is very user-friendly I think.Etwas a pity, however, I find it, that the time, W-Lan / Internet / provider and battery above the percentage battery level is no longer displayed unless you are charging the device actively, or wiping down from above (at the battery) to display the widget menu. For the battery, my iPhone 7 Plus had a battery of 89% after 2 years of use, so actually always super well maintained. The battery of my XS here lasts longer than I'm used to from my 7 Plus (if I remember the early days back). To the display, the camera and the A12 chip, I can not say much, there you should on the Apple Page also make smart times. I think only that the display is still a whole corner sharper and the colors are much richer, the camera has really "NEN" whole bunch "" learned "" and you will of course notice the faster chip. I am myself after 2 weeks of use more than satisfied ! The switch from the iPhone 7 Plus to the iPhone XS was definitely worth it! Whether I would switch however from the iPhone X on the iPhone XS, I could not directly affirm, since the "" innovations "" are presumably too small and Apple calls naturally also juicy prices (whereby the price does not flow into my evaluation, since this yes is known).	1
I have only used Android and a Windows Smartphone so far. Especially the Samsung Galaxy devices have never disappointed me. As the last device before my new IPhone XS with 256gb I had a S9 Plus. But after a few months this became too big and unwieldy for me. Since I've always wanted to try out an iPhone, I decided to go to Saturn and buy one. Here came the first experience that showed me that at Apple is a lot different than the rest of the smartphone world. The seller told me to come back in 3-4 weeks so maybe they would have some in stock. I did not want to believe that but he was serious. After some back and forth, he found a back-laid device in which the financing was not achieved. So I could decide to take this golden 256gb device or drive back home. What should I say, I bought it. And here is my impression after a good 4 weeks: The gold I like after initial concerns very well and the workmanship is great. Thanks to its moderate size, the device fits perfectly in your hand and fits in any trouser pocket. The screen is still a good size and is one of the best I've ever had on a smartphone. The S9 Plus had very good speakers but those of the iPhone XS are even better. The camera is also excellent. When shooting against the light, she's the best I've ever had. The portrait shots are also great. The videos are great. Only in low light conditions was the camera of the S9 Plus a little better. I had to internalize the operating system first. That was not easy for an Android veteran. But after 4 weeks I can say that it is fun. Some things are better and some worse than Android. Top are definitely the speed and Face ID. I love it. A great feature that works great for me 100%. The battery was a positive surprise for me. I turn on my device at 6:30, then read about 1 hour of news and watch some YouTube. From about 8.00 clock I have it at work then in use. There I use the whole day calendar, OneNote, Todo lists, call 20 times and make 5 to 10 pictures. At about 16.30 I come home with about 70% battery. There is still some WhatsApp and about 1 to 1.5 hours of YouTube. Then the day comes to an end with about 50-60% battery for my iPhone XS. About the price I do not want to write much here, who puts the focus on it is certainly wrong with the iPhone XS wrong advice. Personally, I am glad to have risked the change. I can not yet conclusively assess the operating system, but in many ways it is similar to Android and basically faster. The iPhone XS belongs together with the Galaxy S9 Plus to the two best smartphones that I have owned so far. I can recommend it with the best conscience.	1
I have had all the phones that are new. S10, Mi 9, S9, Mate 20 Pro, etc. None of the above delivers such a complete package from like the XS.Differieren you have here the user behavior. I phone a lot, need it for work to eg. Scan documents, take lots of photos and videos (children), lots of music for sports etc. None of the above can deliver a complete package which is consistent in itself. As an example one would like to send documents by mail. Scan by note at the XS, edit and away. Mate requires 3 providers Apps.Was also very good is the privacy. I always feel my data is secure and apps only know what they are allowed to know. This also confirms current procedures in the States. Another point is the battery. Actually, this is considered bad, but I see it differently. With the capacity of the XS and that is partially 50% less, it keeps still good. The question is how long the XS eg. with a 4100 mh battery would die.Die camera, I have seen some better, but definitely not for videos. Unfortunately, Weitwinkel is still missing. Overall, but very suitable for everyday use for family sports and business	1
Hereby I would like to get rid of a few sentences about the iPhone XS after three weeks of use. XS ... Outstanding design combined with the usual high-quality workmanship. It feels good in the hand, feels good and can be operated with one hand. Optics and feel are right. The OLED display shows content razor-sharp and natural. The usability leaves nothing to be desired, everything runs very smoothly and intuitively, the A12 chip and iOS set the bar very high. Thanks to regular updates and outstanding performance, not much will change, iPhones are just going ... The camera is the highlight of the XS for me, the portrait mode is the highlight. So many pictures in such a short time I have never shot with a smartphone and the enthusiasm does not decrease. It is the best camera that has ever been installed in an iPhone. A little criticism, I would like to get rid of it anyway. The battery could have more capacity and the price is too high, actually as always ...	1
Hello, this is already my third review on the iPhone. I've been there since the iPhone 3GS and have never been disappointed with Apple's iPhone history. The following does not refer to the purchase of the iPhone from Amazon. I bought the device in the Apple Store. Thus, I would like to describe my personal experiences with this review (as well as the predecessors) and help others in their decision to buy or change the new iPhone. Packaging / ContentWhen usual, Apple also packs the iPhone XS really excellent. Even at the first sight, the iphone attracts attention with its successful design. In addition to the iPhone XS is still in the packaging of the user manual for the device, the SIM card tool to open the slot on the iPhone and Apple Sticker. Furthermore, a USB to Lightning cable with the corresponding power adapter, which unfortunately continues to be 5Watt and of course the headphones with Lightning connector. What is missing is the adapter from Lightning to 3.5mm jack, this is no longer included with the iPhone XS, which I find very pity, as I continue to use headphones that work with 3.5mm blade and I have to reorder the adapter at Apple , Also, I think it's a great pity that Apple does not attach a larger power plug. The devices charge incredibly long (3 - 4 hours), which really annoying in the long run very annoying. The AirPower for wireless charging is still not available, which one must forego for the time being, although the new iPhones (from the 8 model) support the fast charging function. Here you have to resort to external accessories and spend money to use these new features. I do not expect Apple to settle for the AirPower, but at least a power supply of 20Watt like the iPad should be in there today. All in all, a nice package with some (if not even) annoying smears on the accessories concerns. Packing = Satisfactory-iPhone / DesignThe device really looks class. Have bought the 64GB model in gold and can only say: What a feast for the eyes! The most beautiful iPhone, which I have held so far in my hands. It really impresses and seduces to use. It was set this time on stainless steel instead of aluminum, which makes the iPhone look even higher quality. Whoever holds it in their hands will never want to let it go again. In addition to the volume keys and the power button, the home button has not been used since the iPhone X. By swiping from the bottom of the screen to the top you can now leave an application and get to the homescreen. If you think that this annoys and hampers the operation, I can anticipate the worries: After 1 day I got used to the swipe gestures and it is even more fun than using the predecessor (iPhone 8). Works really perfectly. In addition, at the top of the display there is a notch where a camera has been installed for FaceTime and the sensors, especially FaceID - which I will come across later. Looks really chic. Design is absolutely great !! (Very good) -DisplayWe come to the display. The iPhone XS has a super retina display with a diagonal of 5.8 inches and a resolution of 2436 x 1125 (slightly above FULL HD). Since I come from an iPhone 7 Plus, I have additionally got an OLED display, which leaves again stronger and richer colors. It's a great display. The size of (only) 5.8 inches, the device is also very good in the hand.It has become (really minimal) heavier, but this is not noticeable in everyday life. By far the best display, what I have seen in an iPhone. GREAT!!! (Very good) -KameraAuch the camera has improved compared to its predecessor. Even the smallest model has a camera with two lenses. These are even better and have an even better quality, especially at night. That really stands out and makes impressive pictures. For amateur photographers it is definitely an excellent camera. Since I do not shoot so many pictures, I can not say much about it except what I wrote above. Also the front camera is very good. She can now create portraits (like the front camera), and the Bookeh effect also makes it easy to edit and configure selfies through the blur filter. Of course that's very good for Selfiefans. Have tried it and can really recommend it, but I rarely do it to do it! Camera = Very good !! - PerformanceIt Apple X12 bionic chips with an Apple A12 (I'm not sure anymore) 6 cores and 4GB of memory , The device is incredibly fast and reacts really fast. Have not experienced any stuttering or crashes and hope that stays that way. The performance is generally very good, especially with iOS 12, where again was screwed to the hardware, especially in older devices. Everyone will be satisfied for a very long time. Performance = Very good! Speakers are quite good. Have not noticed a big difference to the iPhone 7 Plus. The sound provides a good bass and good acoustics and can be heard quite well. It is a pity that the 3.5mm blade connector was removed, because then I could try my headphones. Remedy is really only an adapter, which is not included. The sound is generally in order! (Good) operating system / iOS 12On the iPhone XS / XS MAX and Xr iOS 12 is installed by default. For me, it was the version iOS 12.1.2, so an update to iOS 12.1.4 is required. Run as already mentioned all top with the new chip and memory. As indicated above, there is a new feature (at least for those who have switched from iPhone 8 or older) called "FaceID". FaceID is a function that is used to unlock the device by means of face recognition. And that's quite simple in principle: the configuration prompts the user to roll his face once so that the face is recognized by the system. If the system has recognized the face, all you have to do is pick up the phone and wait for a few milliseconds, and it will unlock itself. It works perfectly.I always wear 2 glasses privately, and even then my face was recognized, even in the dark or when I'm getting ready for outdoor - hochgegelte hair, other glasses, etc. all no problem. Facilitates the operation a little and is also great fun. FaceID works very well with iOS 12 and is quite impressive. This should not cause any problems. Even in the App Store FaceID is quite good: If you buy, for example, an app or music, he checked before buying the face once and you can download the product. It is no longer required password. Really simple and very fast, you can not remember. If you want, you can switch off this function completely and access the usual password. Personally, I find it a nice feature. Along with it, the animojis (animated emojis), where emojis are brought to life through your face. A really nice gimmick, which is a lot of fun, if you write with someone and sometimes make some faces. IOS 12 is a successful system with good news and (almost) no mistakes, which makes the use even easier and faster through the optimization of the system. Those who love it will continue to love it.iOS 12 is thus "very good"! - BatteryThe battery has deteriorated somewhat in my opinion. With me are now 3 days instead of 2 days in it, which has me somewhat surprised.At that time, the iPhone 7 Plus, the battery has really lasted very long (to date), but the XS, it seems to me as if the battery life would be worse. Alone in one day I have lost 50%, although I have not really done too much with the device. Perhaps because of the new TrueTone (= function, which ensures that the display adapts to the environment and thus the manual configuration of the display settings is completely replaced and canceled), which significantly reduces the battery life. The battery has really disappointed me a bit, because I wish a little more juice in the device. Battery is unfortunately a total of "sufficient" "aus.-Preis- / VergleichdiskussionThe iPhone XS is available in the standard version (gold, silver black) in the 64GB version for 1149 €. That really was (even for my eyes) a lot of money; it hurt. One wonders of course: Is it really worth buying an iPhone XS or even XS MAX? It depends: If I have a device from the older years (iPhone 5S, 6, 6s, 7 or 8) I would say that a change is already a good jump, because you have the OLED display, a new operation through the display, which stretches to the entire device, FaceID, the performance and a new camera that really justify the price, BUT: Only if the old device is no longer fully functional. If you have not had an iPhone yet, I would advise you: save the money, buy the iPhone X, which is not that different from the successor, then you are well supplied for several years, otherwise the Xr, or wait until the iPhone XS is slightly reduced. The XS MAX I would access ONLY, if the larger display really appeals to you. A lot of battery gets her according to user reports not much out, so that's no reason to buy an XS MAX. € 1249 for an iPhone XS MAX is a lot of money. Otherwise I would wait and see what to say: I really want to use the new features and am very impatient, which should perhaps first consider whether he does not want an iPhone Xr. At first I was convinced that I switch to the XR, but then I have the OLED display, the double camera and especially the size more convinced of the XS, as the Xr, because the Xr was a block for me. The iPhone Xr has the same hardware as the XS (with some restrictions: no TouchID, a camera). If you think that you are buying an iPhone 5C, I have to say that this is not correct. In the 5C you had the old hardware installed, here at Xr you are really on the cutting edge of technology (except for the smears), which should really be enough for many out there.If you decide to buy the Xr, then: Take the XR in your hand and see if you can handle the size and weight. For me it was too big and heavy. Even the LCD display makes a solid impression on the Xr, please do not let the data on the paper affect you. Paper is patient, but whoever thinks he prefers to grab on the XS variants, see if you are not somewhere your old device (if any) sold on Ebay, so you would not have to pay so much , The exchange offer of Apple with the payment of the older device is worthwhile only if no one is really interested in your device or your device is damaged. Since you can easily calculate the value of the device and then this credit will be charged with the price of the new device. So I did it and came to 849 ¬, so in principle as much as the iPhone Xr. I switched from the iPhone 7 Plus with 128GB Space Gray to the iPhone XS Gold 64GB, worked out great. You can also set up your iPhone very comfortably in the Apple Store, then you will save the trouble at home! -> To memory: I changed from the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus to 64GB iPhone XS. Why? Because I used almost nothing. Of the 128GB, I felt 95GB free, not even a quarter, no matter how many photos I took or anything else. At that time, the iPhone 7 Plus was available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. 32GB seemed to me to be a little bit, especially with a plus model, so I decided for the 128GB version. Now the iPhone are now with 64GB memory to haben.Da again: Look how much you use in general. Who is now Poweruser, numerous albums etc.download, which should perhaps (if it is the iPhone XS) to grab 256GB model. 512GB is a memory for the one who is really on the phone every day for 18 hours and makes presentations, series, 100 movies, 1 million songs, 1 million photos, but there should also be enough of the 256GB variant because of the cloud, where the can store most of the data. 5GB cloud storage is available at the factory, who wants to upgrade to up to 2TB. Otherwise 64GB would have to be loose. I still have 48GB of the 64GB free and thus up for more. That's why: Think about it, look at your older devices, how much you have really occupied memory and then decide. As already mentioned: Look at the devices in the store. Decide then, what you like most, because the purchase is worthwhile in my opinion VERY, for that I would first waive the next years on a new one. Conclusion: The new iPhone XS is a really solid, but also an expensive smartphone. This is a lot of money, especially for new buyers. However, the functions promise what a user can expect and can be quite impressive. Owners who have an older iPhone worth the change in my opinion more, especially in contract renewals, because you have to pay one way or the other and you get away with the delivery of the older device again cheaper. New owners should really consider whether the price meets the expectations and wishes that they would like to invest for such a device. But whoever has one will love it: FaceID is a lot of fun, the device is very fast, the camera takes very good pictures and the general operation by wiping gestures with the new OLED display is a wonderful experience !! In this sense: Buy recommendation for owners older = Yes! For new customers = depends on the budget and the expectations. Otherwise = no, not necessarily. Best to wait a bit or to access the predecessor (iPhone X) or the new iPhone Xr. Hope I could bring some with my review some light in the dark and wish you much fun with the new iPhone XS! Yours sincerelyChaosLeopard	1
The iPhone Xs is a fantastic phone - optical (subjective), haptic (subjective) and technical (almost objective). The display is terrific and practical large, the usability very good and the omission of the home button is more blessing, because load. The gesture control (from the lower edge of the screen to highlight) already had Blackberry, and then that was already good to handle. Face-ID works fine for the most part - unless a dark pair of sunglasses is worn or a cap is pulled deep into the forehead; I would not have expected that. Only a small downside mixes in: after a few weeks, the battery capacity has already fallen to 98%. Although not an Apple fanboy, I'm still impressed with this phone. Case / case is the way mandatory ... Only the price is a joke, without question.	1
It is currently the best iPhone on the market and whoever holds it with Apple software probably the best ever uncomplicated smart and just always works	1
Fast delivery. Product arrived in perfect condition.	1
Apple user since the iPhone 3G and still today. Although it was more expensive and expensive, but the quality is also progressing :)	1
I have the iPhone XS since the first day of publication. Before I had the iPhone 7 Plus (which still had a battery capacity of 91% after 2 years!) It was for the first time very unusual for me. At first I was very tired of the homebutton, but after a few days I had changed my habit. Also, the back is no longer dull, but reflective, was forgotten after a few days. Stunning white you never see great fingerprints. Of course this is clearly positive! What I find awesome is the color. The gold has something ... special in itself. It is not typical gold. The reflection is always dipped in a red-orange, which just looks great. The border is normal gold-colored, the narrow display border black - which was also a getting used to, because I was used to the bright, friendly white-gold design. What I noticed pretty quickly, is that it has a better speaker. Whether playing games or talking on the phone, you can really make the volume very loud - without audible loss of quality. The Notch is there, yes, but I do not bother with its disreputable size. Before there was completely border, therefore ... Weight and overall size are different to the iPhone 7 Plus, but was not noticeable to me. Only when I held both devices in the hand, I was much on it. In the pants or jacket pocket but I had no problems even with the 7 Plus. The camera is great, as before. I can not see much improvement in the sensors, but in particular praise the focus in detail. Sound, graphics, and performance are outstanding. But here, too, I had no problems with the iPhone7 Plus. Zero stuttering and not once is it smeared me. The battery holds in my opinion, with active use significantly longer than the old device. Standby seems to me the same, as well as the charging time with the standard cable. Face ID works for me to 99%, even if I do not look focused on the device, but turn the head sideways. If it does not work, which is very rare, or if I lie on my stomach in bed, then I just enter the code. Well, what else should I say ... I'm satisfied, the workmanship is excellent, I have clean nothing to complain about. The price is high, of course, but you know that before and you get extremely good quality! Also the service is correct, which I had to use occasionally in the past years (AppleID forgot password, reclaimed a device (Could Apple ultimately nothing)). Here you can see clearly, where a large part of the money goes, because at no other company I have experienced so good service! Where I can understand grunts, is the standard cable, if yes fast-charge is possible. Because Apple saves in the wrong place.	1
Despite the reviews it was a fake, another cell phone etc, I ordered it because it was 100 ¬ cheaper than directly at Apple. I came to the original Iphone XS in gold, as ordered. Original boxed and with original accessories. Had previously the Iphone 6 and can therefore only recommend it, of the image quality, the resolution of course, the larger storage .... It should be well considered for this price and I hope it lasts as long as my old one ....	1
As expected, a great device. Easy to configure. Was delivered much faster than expected.	1
Great iPhone price of course too high. Battery is ok you come through the day, everything else perfect :)	1
Again, a miracle Apple.Kann almost not imagine what you can do better.	1
Fast delivery, original packaging, good quality, nothing to complain about. Bezgl. of the iPhone itself, I refer to the many tests on the net.	1
Item as described	1
Very good, if you can send some gifts, just fine,	1
Top product Top price I can only recommend	1
Serious, fast, Apple	1
Simply great the phone.	1
Great device	1
I decided despite the price for the silver XS with 256 GB and did not regret it. Come from Android and can only notice improvements. The reception is, even in rural areas, without complaints. Strangely enough, although one initially heard the contrary, it is even better than with my Galaxy. The battery lasts for me full two days. Camera is above reproach and with the professional iOS apps, this can be further upgraded, so that even long low-light footage a la Mate 20 Pro are possible. A good investment that will hopefully be sustainable due to Apple's longer updates.	1
Great running every time again keeps it up.	1
Wow Wow Wow. I think I do not have to say much to this grandiose phone. Of course, the price is very high, he will meet this device? YES! Because everything is running, compared to my old Galaxy S9 super fluid! The camera is amazing, too! Battery life is sufficient for me. Very satisfied!	1
Apple quality stop price is too high but you get nowhere better	1
An iPhone is bought from Apple or the provider with a mobile phone contract!	1
Best smartphone currently on the market.	1
Where are the bad reviews? Android'er? Now to the topic change X to XS, Bin changed because the X still brings money. And I invest only a few euros and get nen new device. Furthermore, I needed more GB memory! Innovations: Battery has remained almost the same (by processor a12) "similar to X" Camera better (SmartHDR), Bokeh effect, Modified LED flash, better wireless charging, Dual eSIM, IP68 Waterproof, Fastest Smartphone on the market, Face ID goes better faster, stereo video / audio, wider stereo effect, LTE Cat 18 with up to 1200 MBit.Sichtbare differences X to XS are the new speakers (below) and the new antenna strips at the top and bottom! up to date who gives 1 star the lie !!!	1
Hammer horny pictures	1
Just dreamlike Apple and I'm really happy with it and have a contract pay less and I think Apple is better because running smoothly and the camera is great	1
The newest iPhone at an ingenious price! The delivery was super fast and unproblematic. Arrived is an original iPhone for the German market ... the sale and shipping took place directly on Amazon, so the negative recessions can not agree and rather have the feeling that these are possible fakes.So everything is great. The phone works perfectly, makes absolutely epic pictures and is well worth the price ... even if I was a little skeptical at first ... I can only recommend it!	1
The title says it all. Whoever spends so much money on a cell phone has to know what he has. I do. The iPhone Xs, like all other iPhones before, fits perfectly into my Apple infrastructure and alone I love it. The device is perfectly processed, incredibly fast, durable and offers with this camera an insanely picture quality. All these factors combined with the stability of the value of the Apple products, it was reason enough for me. Those who enjoy these things will enjoy the device. I advise all others, which are impressed by pure achievement data of the androids, of the purchase. If you helped my honest review, I would be glad about a "" useful ""!	1
The best of iphones !	1
Great timeless design, Face ID super fast. I was a bit skeptical at first if Face ID would work as smoothly as Touch ID. It works better and I do not want to go back to Touch ID. The OLED display is also of high quality, very clear and very sharp. The iPhone fits well in the hand and I feel the weight just right. I do not know what else I should write, which is not found on YouTube in the different channels. If you are not sure, just look there before making a decision. Yes, the price is high. However, Apple provides 5-6 year updates for each device. That one does not have with Android devices just. Hardware and software are, as usual with Apple, coordinated and for years I miss any features.	1
The iphone XS Max replaces an iphone 8 plus for me. Even if the change was not necessary, I finally wanted to own a rimless iphone. Curiously, last year, when the iPhone X was released, a price of over € 1,000 for a smartphone seemed immoral to me. Where my morality is, I have unfortunately not found out.Fun by page. The iphoe XS Max is truly a first-rate device. The feel and the "high" weight make something easy. Compared to my previous iphone 8 plus, the display is a lot brighter and, due to the better resolution, even clearer. The speed is remarkable and noticeably faster than with an iphone X. The cameras, and I mean not only the front camera (keyword beautygate), are world class. I own quite petite (small) men's hands, nevertheless the iphone can be used without problems. Is such a device over 1400 EUR worth? Never consider sober. But from the point of view of enthusiasts anyway! I'm actually no apple fanboy, I own, except for a service ipad and no other apple devices. I already had several android devices (HTC, Samsung, Sony) and even a Windowsphone. But I always came back to apple. On the one hand, iOS is simply the most comfortable and clear operating system for me, on the other hand, I think the phones are just great processed. I can not call you an absolute reason for buying and also disapprove that these devices are so expensive. I consider the iphone a luxury item that just makes me happy.	1
I have chosen the 256 GB version, because that quadruples my previous storage space. My iPhone 6 has accompanied me for four years. The switch to XS Max is a quantum leap! I was skeptical at first because of the Face ID, but it works flawlessly and is a real improvement to the Touch ID, which did not always work reliably. I do not miss the homebutton. Now you just wipe briefly from the bottom up. In terms of performance, I do not have to say much. I'm from the iPhone 6, clearly I'm thrilled! The price is plentiful, but what you get is just lush. I use my phone every day and if it is four years again, which I hope, then I am satisfied and can live with the price. No one is forced to buy the phone. Since I am a lot of outdoor people, I also like that it is finally waterproof. Since the iPhone 4s I only had iPhones, this one is my third and that - of course! - best ever. I would buy it again! As accessories, I have: - Urban Armor Gear Plasma Protective Case for Apple iPhone Xs Max OMOTON [3 Pieces] Protective film for iPhone XS Max [6.5 inch], bulletproof film with positioning aid, 9H hardness VANMASS Car Holder Car Wireless Charger Car Ventilation Car Cell Phone Holder 10W Qi Inductive Charging Station for Car NANAMI Fast Wireless Charger, Qi Charger for iPhone XS / XS Max / XR / X / 8/8 Plus, Wireless Inductive Charging Station	1
... and this is where the ghosts divide. For years, I had always only Apple devices, always like the newest until I got stuck at some point on the iPhone 7+ and then used this until today. There were not many things that bothered me except that the system, Apple typical, is very self-contained and you have little customization options. What disturbed me even more was iTunes. Copy songs to his smartphone, pull down videos or save on it, without this iTunes not possible and for me, unfortunately, always too annoying why I tried the new Galaxy S 10+ times. Yes, I have it for several weeks tested, played around a lot and came back to the current flagship of Apple, you almost want to crawl back mine. Even if there are a few things here and there that annoy me again and again or a little nerves, it is and remains simply the best system! The smartphone is incredibly fast. The operation so wonderfully comfortable, Face ID is in my opinion the nonplusultra. This works so well here that I am sometimes amazed. Even at night in the bedroom with the lights off and minimum screen brightness it unlocks. With a picture or a photo of the person who has been saved the smartphone can not be fooled as this is a 3-D scan. All in all, I can give from my side for the device itself five stars. What I do not want to include in my review is the high price and I have to say unfortunately, I can not justify that! It is a top device and top processed and everything is wonderful and perfect, a real caress, and still. 1150 ¬, currently it is understood for a smartphone is just scary eerily a lot of money. This I would like to use now for several years, and I fortunately also because Apple provides its older devices always reliable with Updates.Ich currently synonymous, the camera of the new Huawei is very praised, especially in low-light scenarios, but why? this is very easy, the pictures are photographed with a kind of long exposure on the P30, so the photos just look very spectacular! The iPhone, on the other hand, makes normal pictures, even at night, and for the fact that these photos are not shot with a long exposure technique, they are still competitive. However, if you have a suitable app, you can also shoot with this smartphone, over the long exposure wonderful pictures! And then again, in my opinion, the P 30 can not keep up. But I do not want to put my hand in the fire for that, I just picked it up in a test for the current P 30. The price for this model is really more than premium! Almost luxury but, and you have to be honest, what you get is in terms of smartphone, just the best in the market. The software is crazy fast, safe, comfortable, easy to understand and intuitive to use, the design is very beautiful except for the slightly too far out standing camera on the back and the processing is, as with all top smartphones currently just perfect. Despite everything and the minor error I can express an absolute buy recommendation.	1
The delivery worked well and without problems as expected. You can not say much about the product itself that is not already freely available in the rest of the internet. Iphones like it or not - the product has its price and it works very well. I have been using Apple products for a very long time and the upgrade of the 6+ has paid off for me.	1
I've been using the iPhone XS Max (64GB) for 3 months now and I'm very impressed. I had some smartphones before that. Be it the S7 Edge, the Note 8 or Note 9, none of these smartphones have a chance. Sure, the cheaper, but in my opinion you notice the difference s.der performance and speakers. The display is much better calibrated than the 9 note, for example. The battery performance is very good, especially the standby mode is world class. I can recommend this smartphone to you, since it has no weaknesses and if you use the device for a few years, then the price is not so bad. + Display + Speaker + Battery + Camera especially videos are very good. + Performance + Operation - feels very smooth-priced	1
Bought as a Warehouse Deal at a fair price, with some late delivery. The description of Amazon is 100% true. Mint condition is really new. There are absolutely no signs of wear and tear. On the requested iOS update, I could see that the iPhone is not a month old and the battery had 100% capacity :-). To the device itself: thanks to the quick start (instructions can be found in the Apple Supportbeteich) was the move from the iPhone 8Plus a breeze. Before that, my Apple Watch decoupled quickly. After about 1/2 hour everything was done and worked perfectly. Activities, emails and apps were mirrored thanks to iCloud Backup. The Apple Watch is paired again and restored from backup. Only the password to the e-mail account had to be entered once. I was skeptical at first whether the switch from the iPhone 8Plus to the iPhone XSmax is worthwhile. Yes! Although there are no worlds in terms of feel, but Face ID, gesture control and the A12 processor are a fine thing. I think with this phone one is the future 4 - 5 years prepared for the future.	1
For an unbeatable price of 1298, - € for the 512 gave variant. All original, works fine, just great! Is Apple worth the money? For me, yes, because iOS is a secure and closed operating system, and Apple unlike the data Octopus Google, not with sensitive data to earn their moneyThen comes the year-long update support and .... the iPhone, it runs and runs and extinguishes the Max If you like me from an iPhone 8 comes gigantic, but I do not want to miss it after just one day, just hammer the display with this great oil technology. Camera, sufficient for me and you get just with every shot a great picture States thanks to Apple software! More I do not write, that should be sufficient as a purchase decision for others. Adè	1
This decision is made first - and then may not complain about the horrendous price. Only the most important: +++ Great sound and volume ++ Charge without cable ++ screen presentation ++ operation without button ingenious + waterproofness + speed + camera unchanged good + face scan surprisingly easy + Battery Runtime great- The larger screen brings nothing- heavier climb from 7pro - otherwise hardly incentives.	1
After 4s, 5, 5s, 6 plus, 6s plus, 7 plus, 8 plus, X now my 9th iPhone and I'm back from the socks. The X was already class, but the XS (Max) puts then dual SIM and much better camera again on it. Likewise, the speakers have been improved, so watching movies on the Max is a pleasure ist.The price of € 1,249 is absolutely justified for the offered. Thanks to Amazon, the Max is also under the Apple Store price. Thank you Amazon!	1
functionality is the same as iPhone X but it's a big display gives the different feeling	1
Apple speaks for itself, great phone!	1
Is it expensive? YES! Is it too expensive? No idea ... Is a Mercedes too expensive? Everyone has to decide for themselves how much everyone is willing to pay for. The tests where Samsung and Huawai are in front of iPhone, I can not understand. The photo features are great and thoughtful ... I have really beautiful portraits made with this phone! And everything else works on this iPhone as you're used to it: easy - fast - secure.	1
It's a great smartphone. Better than all previous versions. But I think it's expensive. Nevertheless, I would buy one again.	1
Because of the price, I decided to buy the mobile phone. Now I have been using it for several months and I am satisfied. Delivery or delivery the same as if ordered from Apple. I have NEVER had any problems with an iPhone, so also on Amazon clear buy recommendation	1
Have long searched for such an iPhone case. All other solutions have so heavily applied to the iPhone or not protected. Have the IPhone XS Max now twice accidentally dropped and both times fully on the Kante.Ca. 1m height on asphalt. No scratch in the case and no damage to the iPhone.Without additional metal plate, the iPhone can be attached to magnetic mounts by the cover.And last but not least, it can be easily loaded by induction.Habe the shell now almost 4 weeks in use and can only five Awarded star.	1

Before, I bought the iPhone XS Max at Mediamarkt and not at Amazon, so I can not say anything about the order! I got the iPhone instead of the actually planned Huawei Mate 20 Pro, because unfortunately, like many others, too the delivery shortfalls or bottlenecks despite pre-orderer was affected and unfortunately the support from both sides (Huawei and especially Amazon) was deficient. After a long time it was then despite the more than lush and exaggerated purchase price of 1249 ¬ the iPhone. Vorab I have I tried it on Android and I was never really warm with iOS, but I was taught a better. I had to date no cleaner, liquid, noble (at the price also to be expected ) Smartphone obsessed. In addition to a number of benchmarks that are online and reviews about battery problems when loading or the runtime is low I can say flat rate that is not so, of course, depending on the use! I have the XS Max now a good three weeks despite Apple layman absolutely confident and can recommend it to anyone.Haptik 1 with asterisk design and processing noble.Drotz my initial concern that one recognizes in the color silver with chrome edge of any dirt, I am also positively surprised. The Oled display is simply a dream, bright colors , razor-sharp and without quirks or possibly errors such as the "gloo gate" at Huawei.Face ID is a personal conversion for me personally, but works perfectly and after easy familiarization, it is quite commonplace. To camera and Co. I say here nothing, plus there are enough online tests for the rest of the hardware. But there are also 2 personal flaws that annoy me: I'm still li egen the scope of supply normal EarPods with Lightning connector and the 5W charging adapter bei.Bei a purchase price of 1249 ¬ I think that you should attach at least the large 12W charger, so that the load is not 2h + lasts. And as a purchaser or pre-orderer I would like to The AirPods as a free addition pleased / a shell on the part of Apple, alone because the purchase price without the last points just crazy.However, the device is ansich for me the best mobile phone on the market! I do not want to miss it anymore and would do so now the iPhone once had very difficult to have an Android smartphone again. Therefore clear buy recommendation!	1
Anyone looking for a smartphone with the best workmanship, fluid software and top specs will definitely be happy here. Of course, the price is higher than any competitor's, but nobody is forced to buy. In addition, one can expect a life cycle of at least 3-4 years for iPhones, with constant speed of the operating system and current updates. This is so in no other device and is definitely a unique selling point and purchase argument. The display is crisp and bright. The battery keeps loose all day, and if not he can recharge quickly, even via wireless. (QI) All in one a top device for no reason of complaint. Bought in the Apple Store.	1
I've tried several times to switch from the android to the egg-phone, each time without success. The Appleaner only convince me of the design and the quality, so I always try ... But no - I'm an Apple-Hater! I can do it simply not, whether I want or notThe things are only unnecessarily expensive and force one to always buy their accessories and the compatibility usually remains only in the family (example, iTunes requirement or Lightning port and accessories which only runs over it.Therefore, fingers away ^. ^ (my opinion)	1
Even if now some Android users will mentally stony ;-) This provocative statement of mine also applies to the other current iPhones (iPhone XS, iPhone XR). How do I get that opinion? A little story ... Six weeks ago it was time again. On a whim, I have the new Huawei P30 Pro ordered. Qualitatively a top device, the color combinations a force, the finger-print sensor a small revolution. The built-Leica camera is unrivaled for me. With a bit of patience, you get beautiful photos. In addition to the standard functions, you can even choose the aperture (for example, aperture 8 for a higher depth of field). The post-processing leaves nothing to be desired. In particular, I liked the possibility of creating monochrome images in which certain areas are provided with color. Thus, it is easily possible to represent a person in the foreground in color and the background in black and white. But where is light, is unfortunately synonymous Schatten.Die video function of the camera is unfortunately in no way on the amount of time. That would have me alive Much worse weighs the built-in mono speakers. I like listening to audiobooks on my smartphone. There was a lack of volume and dynamics. Very sad. Another K.O.-Criterion is the Bluetooth connection to the Navi.It is not possible to playlists on the device or to select specific titles. Only the functions "" Title before "", "" Title back "", "" louder "" and "" quieter In addition, songs within the playlists were displayed in the wrong order. Then, last week, came the super-Gau: Huawei was blacklisted by the US. I want to emphasize that Huawei does not blame it and I can not understand how it is possible that a single, greedy person can seal the fate of a globally recognized company.That is absolutely sad and incomprehensible to me! It came as it had to come.Future oriented and in the hope that mine Problems with the Bluetooth connection to be solved, I sold the P30 Pro with decent loss and I've gained a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. My first impression: The charger significantly slimmed, the design rather old Somewhat disappointed was the hope for decent speakers and a proper function in the car. First, the positives: The stereo speakers are top and the order of the songs within the playlists is correct. However It is also not possible with the Samsung to select playlists directly from the sat nav or to specifically select songs. I've searched several forums and unfortunately had to take as a conclusion that the Android system obviously does not provide all the necessary Bluetooth functions that are needed to control the phone completely from the sat nav. Also, with the Note 9's camera being just average, I reluctantly decided to abandon my Android experiment and return to the iPhone XS Max on my knees. Apple is extremely expensive and maybe not always technically leading, but everything works as it should .Very good photos, outstanding videos, Apple Pay (with very high acceptance compared to Google Pay and Co.) and most importantly: The Bluetooth connection works in full. So it is possible from the Navi directly through the playlists So it has to be.Was I learned from it? I will not be upset in the future about trivialities that bother me with the iPhone but on the flawless function of the devices and above all on the future joy Due to the long supply with updates as well as the above-average resale value the price of the iPhones is absolutely justified .: This review only reflects my personal opinion and I do not want to annoy or hurt anyone.	1
But could easily cost 2 to 3 thousand euros more because I see everyone running around with the phone. The phone loses in value ... so it should cost at least 3500 ¬ :)	1
For 1 1/2 years I have an iPhone X, which is not significantly different from the XS, except for a few small things. From the iPhone 5 I had every generation in use. The iPhone X in combination with iOS works perfectly and has not left me in the lurch! The whole package fits, so I can not understand some reviews here. And if you look closely it also recognizes that the negative reviews come from unverified purchases. That says it all :)	1
In terms of performance, camera quality (in good light), design and more. no one makes the XS MAX what. The new controller makes the phone extremely fast to use. FaceID almost always works perfectly and fast. Have the iPhone since it's out and regret the purchase for a second. However, bothering 2 points that is definitely the low light camera performance which is felt worse than the old iPhones and the price. 1400 ¬ are really much if Apple continues to buy I definitely no new one.	1
The best iPhone ever. No comparison to my previous iPhone X. Again a lot better. A cinema screen and in color gold just noble.	1
I've had the iPhone X so far and just wished I had a bigger display. Finally the perfect Iphone I love it, the operation, the design, just a dream	1
Switching from the Iphone 6 ran smoothly and I'm thrilled in every way!	1
This phone is simply top can not complain	1
Fast delivery super cellphone	1
In the following report, I would like to pass on my experience with the new iPhone Xs Max. I have chosen the 64GB version in the color Space Gray. *** Packaging *** The packaging is typical as you know it from Apple and has does not change. On the front is the front of the iPhone Xs Max to see the current Planet Wallpaper. The box is now wrapped in a plastic wrap, which you can quickly raise by means of a tab. The visual presentation is successful, even if everything is already the same for years. But this is also good. *** Scope of supply *** Am Scope of supply has changed a bit this year. In addition to the power plug, Lightning cable and the Lightning headphones is this year no jack adapter beigegt.Ich have never needed this adapter, but I think it's a pity that this is no longer there. There are Certainly enough people who need this adapter and now have to pay 10 € extra for it. *** Design *** The design has not changed, except that the Xs Max is now a little bigger. The Xs is identical to the iPhone X from the last one Jahr.Das display takes now almost the entire front, the corners are rounded and fit very well into the overall picture. The Notch has not bothered me on the iPhone X and disturb them I do not get used to it this year either. I quickly got used to it from the start. But I also understand that many are dissatisfied with it. That is of course a matter of taste. In the next few years the notch will be smaller. I like the design well. Tastes are different and that's a good thing. *** Processing *** The iPhone Xs Max is really top processed, it feels really high quality and you can tell directly that you have to do it with a premium device Price, it would be bad if it were not. The transitions from the display to the stainless steel frame to the back of the glass are really perfect and clean worked. There is nothing to complain about. In addition, all buttons have a pleasant and crisp pressure point without something wobbles. That's how it should be. The workmanship has not gotten better or worse, but has remained at the same high level. Whether or not the glass has become more resistant to scratches, i I do not say, because I always use a display film. The glass back is still very susceptible to fingerprints, in the dark version you can see it even more clearly. Besides the screen protector, I always use a sleeve, so this "" problem "" does not directly concern me However, with glass backs, this is normal and can not be avoided. For Galaxy Note 9, for example, this is exactly the same. The camera on the back is still vertically arranged and it is a little bit more out this year. However, this is so minimal *** Memory *** The iPhone Xs Max is available in memory sizes 64GB, and 256GB and for the first time in 512GB. If you like movies offline and often shoot videos, especially in 4K, then In any case, you should opt for a larger storage variant. Especially films actually need the most storage space, I myself still come with 64GB of memory He handles very well, since I only leave apps and pictures permanently stored on the device. I always transfer videos to the computer to save memory. Here everyone has to decide for themselves how much memory is appropriate for the personal user experience. The price, of course also a role. ** Dual SIM ** The new iPhone now supports for the first time two SIM cards. Once the normal SIM and an eSIM.Da I do not need this feature, I can not write anything more accurate to the operation.*** Display *** The display is again an OLED display used. The colors are great, the contrast is really good, the brightness is also very good, even in a brighter environment or outdoors in the open. Due to the size of the Xs Max, the display is really a dream and it is great fun to consume content with it. The iPhone X display was also very good and I must honestly say that I could not see much difference. Both displays are at a high level. The colors are not quite as gaudy as Samsung, but these are very lively and colorful without being too oversaturated. The viewing angles are also good, but still not 100% optimal. For a white background, for example, this is a bit bluish if one From the side on it looks. In normal everyday use this falls as good as ever, but it must be mentioned. This can also vary from device to device In the case of the iPhone Xs Max, this is much less noticeable. If the display should have too much yellowish tint, then this can be corrected in the following way: 1. Enable True tone2. For display adjustments - - Activate color filter3. Activate color cast4. Set intensity between A and T5. Set the color tone between blue and purple (The pens at the top are the orientation) Then the display is as it should be. True tone can then be deactivated again. I am still not a fan of True Tone and leave this always off. *** Loudspeaker *** The iPhone Xs Max are again 2 speakers are used which should provide for stereo quality. A speaker is located as usual on the bottom, the second speaker gives the sound on the earpiece The quality is really good. The sound is nice clear and loud and it's fun to watch videos and listen to music. Unlike the iPhone X, the sound quality has improved a bit. I'm really happy with that. ** * Battery *** The battery is a big plus point in the iPhone X Max.I'm already well understood with the battery performance of the iPhone X, the iPhone Xs Max was this noticeably improved Also, there are no problems with the battery life, so you will be quite satisfied. With the iPhone Xs Max you can easily get through the day. For me it is at least 2 days and often I have to recharge only on the third day. It comes Of course, it depends on how strong you use the device. More battery is always good and therefore this is also a very good improvement to the iPhone X.Wireless charging is also supported again. All Charging Pads that support the QI standard can be used. I used a Wireless Charging Pad from Samsung and Anker.Beides works without problems. Fast Charging supports the iPhone Xs Max again, but you have to buy a separate power supply for this year. This I did not and I will not in the future. *** Performance *** The new A12 Bionic processor is used. Everything runs smoothly. Whether switching between apps, opening apps, zooming, wiping and scrolling Everything is very smooth and fast. Ruckler I could not find any. It is really great fun to use the iPhone.Here you have to mention fair that this also applies to the iPhone X. Here, the operation was also great and there were no problems. The improved performance is also more or less noticeable only in direct comparison. All normal apps like the camera, contacts, phone or WhatsApp can be opened at the same speed. For example, the timeline of Instagram or Twitter opens a little faster. Also, the loading times are a bit shorter for some games. But I think this will be for the In addition, the IOS12 again improves the performance, even with "" older devices "" The overall performance and the interaction between software and hardware is really great, even if it was only slightly improved. One should not expect a huge jump. The speed of load times compared to a Galaxy Note 9 is about the same, at least when it comes to apps. Sometimes the iPhone is slightly faster, then the touch again 9.All normal apps such as the camera, phone, etc. open pretty much fast. The boot process at Note 9 is a bit faster, but are the iPhone Xs Max the loading times at games something shorter.The change between the apps is also the same. But the differences are actually so small, so that they are not really important and only make themselves felt in direct comparison. *** Face ID *** I must honestly say that I am with The technology works reliably and for me sufficiently fast. In the iPhone X, I had quickly got used to it, so now no getting used to it. Touch ID was and is good, but personally I do not mourn the fingerprint sensor after. The setup is very fast and simple. After the face has been scanned twice Face ID can be used. Nothing has changed here. On the lockscreen is a small lock to see, this symbolizes whether the iPhone was locked or unlocked. After successful unlocking you wipe up and you get immediately to the home screen. Also here everything has remained unchanged. Face ID works now very minimal faster. However, this is only in direct comparison auf.Im everyday use has remained the same: As already advertised on the iPhone X. Face ID also works with a hat, scarf or sunglasses and with the same speed.-If you have your eyes closed, Face ID will not work, even if you close your eyes behind a pair of sunglasses it will not work.-Face ID works normal daylight, in bright lighting, for example, with Philips Hue, under artificial light and outdoors without problems.-In a dark Face ID also works very well and without any problems.-I have the iphone sitting in a small stand on the desk.If I wake the iPhone standing up with a double tap, and look at it from top to bottom, Face ID also works , One does not have to hold the iPhone exactly in front of the face and always pay attention to the exact distance. *** everyday use *** The iPhone Xs Max is about as big as the Plus models, just without this thick frame top and bottom.Ich had previously always the Plus models, so I come with this size also very well klar.Ich operate the device with two hands, and that is no Umwöhung for me. In Galaxy Note 9, this is the same. My hands are also rather small. If you just want to type a message, it works with one hand, but that's an exception. It may sound funny, but since the device is so big you have to make sure that the pockets are big enough, then you get There are no problems here. With small tight trouser pockets you have no chance to stow the iPhone Xs Max. Although the Xs Max is larger than the normal Xs, unfortunately the display does not show any content anymore.Unfortunately, the apps are not yet adjusted. In the Plus models, there was always a landscape mode in the homescreen. In the iPhone Xs Max, there is not this. (Except for the apps) The new gestures introduced in the iPhone X I still find this year good and there are no problems in everyday life. I've also gotten used to it in the last year. With iOS 12, all open apps can be closed by wiping upwards. You no longer have to press the respective app to see it afterwards The one can only see the percentage of the battery in the controller center, has also remained the same. The upper recess for the camera is and remains in any case a matter of taste. For me personally, this recess was never annoying. I could not find any negative problems in connection with it which disturbed me in any way. *** Camera *** Often there are only marketing slogans when it comes to improvements of the camera But here you have to say that the camera is actually better than it was the case with the iPhone X. The pictures with the new camera make a very good impression. The pictures are now sharper, more colorful, they have less noise and it The colors of the pictures are very natural. Even under bad lighting conditions, the better camera noticeable. Also here you can see a difference. The pictures are also brighter and the noise was reduced. The depth of field effect can now also edit later similar to how it is synonymous with Samsung möglich.Auch that works very well. I have to say that I'm not a professional, for For me the pictures just have to look good and that is the case with the new iPhone Xs Max. Professionals will be able to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the pictures even better. I can not do that. Newly added is that the video camera now synonymous the sound The sound is definitely better, but it depends on the situation where you film. The quality of the videos is generally very good. The picture is super fluid and sharp. Here is nothing for me to moan. Whether Nature shots, videos from and with friends or videos from the family, the camera gives very good results. In summary, the camera has gotten better and you can see it, but that does not mean that the iPhone X camera was bad or is *** Conclusion *** You will notice that the new iPhone Xs has improved only a bit to its predecessor and rather only a few optimizations were made. I buy each year the new iPhone, this is equivalent he is not the norm, but because of the fact that technology is a big hobby of mine. This year, it is me but heavier than usual fallen. My biggest purchase reason was the larger Display. I always had the Plus models, and had me this size For this reason, I am also very satisfied and regret the purchase in no case. The quality is as always very very good, the display is fantastic, the battery has been improved and the camera makes even better pictures. The iPhone Xs Max is really great, but this also applies to the predecessor, the iPhone X. Here comes the price question into the game and you should think twice, if you want to pay the extra charge for the newest model. But you really want one iPhone in this size and you're used to such big smartphones, then the Xs Max is the right choice. I've added images comparing the size of iPhone Xs Max and the Galaxy Note 9 show.An example of the kicker app shows how much content the respective display shows.	1
What can I say...? Best iPhone, what ever! Everyone can find tests on technology etc. on the internet. Here is just my personal impression. I never wanted an iPhone - until about 4 years ago was still enthusiastic Android / Samsung fan. Then I had the iPhone 6s - THAT was a great phone! Aluminum body and a top OS. I quickly got used to this flatterer. Just perfect and no problem with any Android Samsung updates ... Then I saw the Samsung S8 + with his display ... and went again strange ... The Samsung I used about 1 year - then I have the aluminum, the processing, the look and especially the feel / operation of the iPhone misses again I then bought the iPhone 7 Plus. GREAT! Super large display - but just "" only "" LCD ... But what the hell - was still like a home come "" in the iOS world ... :-) From the iPhone XS MAX, I was afraid for a long time because of Price back !!! But after I recently had it live in an electronics market and was allowed to marvel at the display - I was "" in love with the shock ""! ;-) The price I did not care now and I got the 256 GB version in silver. The price was worth it now. Everyone has to decide for themselves. Surely the Samsung 10 might be better - but as an Apple follower (I also have iMac, MacbookPro, Applewatch and iPad), this XS MAX has been a "must-have" for me. And I'm absolutely thrilled! This feeling while touching ... a great piece of technology from a single source. I have not looked back...  :-)	1
I am completely satisfied with the new iPhone! The new camera is much better than my old iPhone 6 Plus. The big screen is gorgeous. The optical design Apple is also well succeeded. It is a very high price for a smart phone. But once you become an Apple fan, you are not satisfied with any other smartphone anymore.	1
Everything has already been written here. Very high quality product. Sure, well peppered price, but I only change my iPhone every four years. But no one has forced me to buy it. Great in handling. Everything is perfect. Beautiful photos, the resolution is great. I am happy every day, do not regret it in any way.	1
I am very satisfied with the iPhone XS Max, also the delivery went very fast although it was long distance, 3days. Good service!! and good price !!!	1
The iPhone is easy to put into operation and also harmonizes well with the Apple What's 4 together. In the Android system to Apple without difficulty. One disadvantage, you have to invest significantly more money for these components.	1
As usual great product	1
Finally, an iPhone with a large Display.Die color representation of the display is better for me than the competition.The device is running and jerking never.The camera is extremely good.Why not what the next year would like to improve ....	1
It is simply beautiful. Basically nothing other than the iPhone 7 Plus, which I had before. That was already expensive. The mobile phone now costs almost 1400 €. I did not buy it from Amazon, only the accessories here. It feels good in the hand, is my choice, everything runs without problems. Is just Apple and my preference. I have had a lot of Android related issues, I just do not like it. This device is for people who are traveling irrationally. Maybe the competition is doing just as well. But iOS does not even run on the Galaxy S 10. That's why I do not even look at it.	1
Do you need an iPhone XS? If you already have an iPhone X, the jump will not be enough. But with the iPhone XS Max is now finally a larger model in the premium range of the iPhone models available. Despite the 6.5 inches, the phone with average-sized male hands is easy to use. The build quality is like the X a dream and can hardly better his. Face ID runs a little faster and has become better at awkward angles. If you've always wanted a bigger version of the iPhone X, the XS MAX is definitely the right choice!	1
is Apple ... as always great ...	1
Hello community, with a few exceptions (see my Essential Phone Review) I have been using Apple's 4 from 2010 primarily just more devices from Apple. This also has its reason: the ecosystem and some other trivial things convince me for years at Apple simply more. Usually in the rhythm of two years, I have each brought me a new generation. After careful consideration I'm this year after only about 10 months of iPhone X switched to XS Max. The huge display has just done to me. Enclosed now my experience with the device since release. (Summary below in the conclusion). Packing: Apple-typical, the delivery is once again limited to the bare minimum. In addition to iPhone itself is still a low-power 5W power adapter, a USB Type A to Lightning cable (1m) and the "EarPods" called headphones in the small box. There is still a bit of paperwork and two Applesticker.Usutlich monetary policy reasons, this year the Lightning was painted on 3.5mm jack adapter. Wired headphones can therefore only be connected if you buy the adapter separately for an additional 10 EUR. Design and workmanship: The design language Apple has left the XS Max in the much the same as that of the iPhone 6. The now made of stainless steel frame is slightly rounded and is free of unequal gaps in the glass front and back over. Cut-outs for speakers, connection and above all for the single SIM slot have been processed absolutely clean. There is nothing to complain about the remaining keys as well. The volume, the "Leister" and the "Power" keys can be easily felt and react as desired at any time. The slider for "silent" could be a bit heavier for my sense. A little bit unattractive is also that the glass back is typically very prone to fingerprints and therefore usually looks a little dirty. The same applies to the stainless steel frame.In sum of all features, the device still feels incredibly high quality. With just over 200 g, the device is not exactly a lightweight, but emphasizes once again the very noble appearance of the phone. Incidentally, the size is very similar to that of the Plus models.Display: The 6.5 "OLED display with a crooked resolution of 2688x1242 pixels (458ppi) resolves very sharply and covers it with a ratio of 19.5: 9 85% the entire front surface. As with all predecessors, the refresh rate remains at max. 60 Hz (the touch sensitivity, however, at 120 Hz). With the naked eye and without measuring devices, I can put absolutely nothing on the display. OLED typical, the black levels are perfect (black is black) and the max. Brightness is absolutely sufficient, even under the open sky in the sunshine. The display supports the extended color space after "Display P3" and is HDR10 compatible with DolbyVision. Or more simply, the color representation is also excellent. So that colors are also displayed as intended, Apple calibrates each device individually. What I also noticed positively, is that the front glass and the display below form a quasi unity. Both are so close together that one has the feeling, for example, to touch an icon directly (many devices have a visible layer of air between them). At Apple, however, this is already several generations longer.Performance: This year, the manufacturer has again turned on the performance screw. The performance increase is compared to its predecessors on paper, although as small as never before, but are still processor and graphics unit Also noteworthy is that since the 6s Apple has built particularly fast memory modules based on an SSD and thus additionally improves the overall performance. The device responds very smoothly at any time. Whether long menu lists, elaborate websites in the browser or the resource-hungry games make no difference (unlike z.on the Essential Phone in some areas). Generally, iOS 12 always responds directly to touch gestures. Scrolling is always smoother for me than it is for Android, and the delay in the millisecond range between touching the screen and the first reaction is faster and more accurate than on Android. (In words, the feeling is really hard to describe) All in all, it can be said that the iPhone XS Max has enough power reserves for the next few years too. Software and apps: The XS Max comes with the latest software version, iOS 12. In addition smaller meaningful additions this year a special focus on an improved general performance. Most benefit from older iPhones, but version 12 is also the largest iPhone ever very good. The special thing about Apple is still that the different device categories very interlinked are. Many things are synchronized via the iCloud and are automatically available on iPad or Mac (photos, news documents, etc.). An automatically performed data exchange via the iCloud is very easy to set up and is therefore aimed at non-tech savvy people important point here so clearly for the Apple ecosystem speaks. Another important point for me is the direct software support by the manufacturer. Up to 5 years, the devices are supported with new major releases. Unique in the smartphone sector! In the event that security vulnerabilities are known, Apple i.d.R. Updates very quickly after-for all reasonably current devices. As a platform disadvantage is of course the closed system to see. On the iPhone comes only what is left by Apple in the AppStore. A certain kind of patronage that certainly does not taste many. But this also ensures that the security compared to Android is simply higher. By the way, the app offer via the store is very good and is in no way inferior to the one in Google PlayStore. Most of the time, quite the contrary, because many apps are simply better implemented by the same developer for iOS - in my opinion, at least. By the way, apps related to the iPhone XS Max have to be adapted to the new display resolution by the developer. Those only adapted to the X are simply displayed larger. The first apps are already available for the XS Max and then offer more content. In the next few weeks and months will certainly do much here.Camera: At first glance, compared to the X has not done much - it remains at 12 MP.Von this fact should not be fooled. All the improvements can be found under the hood or in the more powerful software. On the hardware side, the new camera system sheds more light on the sensor, with the result that more details can be recorded especially in low-light conditions. At the same time, the software ensures this , that all inclusive several photos of different exposure are taken and put together to a photo (simply said). The algorithm behind this Apple simply calls Smart HDR. Of all this, the user does not notice the way. All calculations are live and in real time. Smart HDR is especially visible when very bright and very dark spots appear together on a picture. Specifically, light areas are reduced a bit and thus get more details, while dark areas are highlighted. As an example, I would like to call a photo against the sun here. By the way, I am very satisfied with the camera upgrade, I am even very positively surprised. The difference even to the X is in any case greater than I would have expected in the beginning. In comparison, the XS Max is visibly better than the Essential Phone and can certainly keep up in the field of photography with the Android flagship Samsung, Huawei and Co.Improvements Apple made this year synonymous with video recordings. These can now finally be recorded in stereo. Furthermore, up to UHD at 60 Hz or FHD at 240 Hz for slow motion is recorded. Thanks to optical stabilization (OIS), videos also appear to be quite free from camera shake for a smartphone and are not compressed too much. The iPhone will continue to be the reference for video. The front camera continues to have 7 MP, but now support 60 Hz at FHD for Videotelefonie.An Selfie fanatics and Instagram users, however, new gadgets with background blur (bokeh) in portrait mode. The blur effects can be adjusted at any time in hindsight at will and that is very intuitive. Operation: The sheer size of the XS Max naturally also has a corresponding effect on the operation. Even with big hands, it takes some practice to operate the device with one hand. In order to reach the top and bottom of the display, it requires a dynamic posture in the hand. This can be achieved quite well by means of generous thumb movements. Basic controls such as Control Center, Notification Center or the "Back" gesture can thus still be operated. Comfortable and safe, but something else. Preferably I use the phone therefore with two hands, alone for the reason that simple short messages with two thumbs can be written much faster. Also, the much smaller iPhone X, I usually have two Used hands. The conversion is so limited for me. Since the introduction of the iPhone X in 2017 finally the annoying home button was deleted and replaced by a very intuitive swipe gesture. The general ease of use has therefore further increased for my taste. The proven Touch-ID finger scanner has now been replaced by Face-ID, a 3D face scanner. The unlocking of the iPhone takes a very short time longer, but for my feeling, however, reliable. Especially in terms of sweaty or simply wet hands, there were with Touch-ID again and again recognition difficulties. Touch ID was particularly negative to me at the time when I was traveling home on the construction site and I had building materials in my hands every day and therefore the sensor had to be read in every two days. With Face-ID you are spared all this. The eyewear, caps / hats tested by me were never a problem for face recognition. On the subject of security is said that Face-ID, unlike many implementations on Android can not be tricked by a simple photo. Lt. Manufacturer is Face-ID also safer than Touch ID. Battery: Compared to the iPhone X and the recently used Essential Phone, it is much more durable battery. With an identical use case and the same usage time, I usually spend about 1.5 days with the X on about 2.5 days. For me it means: some news / mail, 45 minutes of news reading, 15 minutes of video watching, 30 minutes of streaming music, 30 minutes of other searches in Safari, occasionally taking some photos, other short games. The display Mainstream Eater is controlled by Auto Brightness and is usually set below 50%. If possible I use in each app the dark surface (Dark-Mode). This helps the OLED display to save energy. Bluetooth and GPS are turned on only when used actively. The run times that Apple itself gives seem to be plausible. Cable-bound charging by means of the included 5 W power supply I would not recommend the way. The charging times are just too long with 3.5 hours. Through separate accessories can be the XS Max in 30 min to 50 % fast loading. For this purpose, a power supply with min.18 W, USB-C port and USB PowerDelivery and a Lightning USB-C cable needed, so additional expenditure of about 40 EUR.Als price / performance tip, however, the 12 W iPad power supply is recommended for about 17 EUR or a third-party Power supply of this performance class - eg from anchor for about 13 EUR. Charging times of about 2 - 2.5 hours are therefore realistic. Alternatively, the iPhone can be "wireless" on the standard Qi with at least up to 7.5 watts and in about 3 hours laden.Other: Some users have lt. Internet entries div. Techn. Problems with their XS models (loading bugs, poor LTE reception,). I could not find any of these points for me. LTE reception I feel even better than the iPhone X. Especially the topic of LTE XS is a exciting. Here, Apple has made comparatively large changes, which can have a positive effect, especially in practice. The new Gigabit LTE modem is by 4x4 MIMO very often significantly faster than that of the X, as it simply said, the existing LTE infrastructure can better exploit the network operator. On average I can see a 50% improvement in the download rate at the sites I tested. The best: I do not have to pay more for my network operator. A corresponding tariff with high max. Download rates is required. Otherwise, it may already be throttled (by the network operator) before the XS Max can exploit its advantage. Conclusion: Bottom line is Apple's XS Max, once again, the best iPhone ever. Processing and haptics are above all doubt and can absolutely convince. The OLED display is one of the best that you can get in smartphones and represents the sheer size of much content dar. Also performance in terms of CPU, GPU performance, but Also in terms of speed and fluidity of the operating system are Referenz.berzeugen can also convince the new camera system - mainly by software tricks with Smart HDR.Auch the operation has been revolutionized by swipe gesture instead of home button and Face ID instead of Touch ID really a few and just very well implemented. As annoying I see the minimum scope of delivery and of course the absurdly high price of 1.419 EUR MSRP for 256 GB. Can the device really justify such a high price? I would say no! A very large proportion of users will find Android in much of comparable services at less than half of the price. The iPhone XS Max shows me that despite mega performance, the price / performance ratio still maximally with the note "Satisfactory" can be evaluated. Especially since many accessories must be purchased separately again / can and of course even more money in the cash registers of the manufacturer rinses.Richtig is outrageous (at the price) that no jack adapter and no quick charger are attached.Dennoch, the iPhone is for me no alternative because I have not actually opted for the iPhone itself, but rather for the Apple ecosystem. So one is unfortunately more willing to bite into the clearly too expensive apple. If I do not consider the price, the iPhone XS Max still deserves 5 stars. Otherwise it is rather 4. ++ Design / Processing ++ Display ++ Performance Hardware / Software + Camera ++ Operation + Battery Scope Price If my review was helpful, I would be very happy to receive a corresponding rating. Many Thanks!	1
Top cell phone just so awesome and beautifully processed absolutely satisfied Apple ever Apple	1
very well	1
Apple just. Except price all top	1
Since 26.10.2018 the Iphone XR is available. Strange that there is only one customer review. But when I look at the prices here, I'm not really surprised. Here 897 € and more are called. Even at Apple directly costs the XR 64 GB 849 ¬. If you buy an XR here, you are no longer capable of doing business. I personally had the XR in yellow, but I exchanged it for the Iphone XS Max 64 GB in gold. But since I still have the X, I'm about giveback at Apple me the XR still take, probably in coral. I think the XR is awesome. If you see the full posts on youtube, where one of the other nachsabbelt the other, that is incompetent to be incompetent. You can watch these videos as a kind of comedy show. There is talk of a weak diploma resolution, of the size, the weight, disadvantages of the camera and sometimes the colors are criticized. Colors: If you stick to the topic of colors, my opinion is that you can only take yellow or coral. There are still blue (for me baby blue), Product Red (there was already the 8 in a product red version so nothing new), black and white. Since the XR should be more of a lifestyle object because of the colors, for me the usual monotony falls out, so black or white, with white in the present form (ie real white) is still somehow acceptable. But sense makes the purchase of an XR only in a correct color and sees for me especially yellow very noble ais, but the more interesting color is coral, by the way, also looks quite noble. Camera: The camera at the XR is generally praised in all tests synonymous compared to the XS / XS Max. It is just no dual camera, but should provide the moodier pictures. I myself could not test it yet because I do not have the XR n o c h, but the tests and descriptions are all consistent and credible to me. The possibilities with the front camera are the same as with the XS, there are all 5 portrait possibilities available, with the main camera only 3, which I consider completely sufficient. You can not use the bokeh effect on the main camera if you want to record an object or something like that in portrait mode, or at least not a person. Of course you can still take a normal picture anyway. Otherwise the cameras are qualitatively identical with the XS and the XR except for the zoom. Apple will have thought very carefully that you can not sell high-priced iPhones like the XS or XS Max as colorful mobile phones well, there is always the danger that one Looking at the color but rather sattsieht, so seen, the price for the XR is appropriate, since it looks quite noble because of the glass on the front and back and consequent changed changed depending on the light color reflections on the back. From IOS 12.1, the bokeh effect is already adjustable during or before recording and even after the recording.Face-ID: I can not understand the people who are still crying the homebutton, I use iphones from the beginning, so since 2008, I do not want to exchange the homebutton for Face-ID anymore.Recently I used the 8 + again after a long time with the X, the Homebutton really bothered me. As soon as you take the XS in your hand, it's already unlocked, even the gesture control without the homebutton is ideal, so I do not want to see the homebutton anymore and that will be so in the future. Chip: I do not want to go into the technology , on the A-12 bionic chip you can read something on every corner, I personally never thought that you notice the differences in speed as a user at all, all the iphones I've had so far have always run flatly without complaining : Apple uses an LC display on the XR, an OLED on the X, XS and XS Max. In my opinion, the LCD is so good that I would not open a keg in the sense that the quality of the LCD is poorer, considering the data on the paper, but the personal impression and that should be decisive. I compare the quality with the 8 plus and I found that very good and m.E. like the XR not criticizable. The display size of the XR is ideal, just between the XS and the XS Max, the X and the XS I think from the beginning to small, the trend goes for some time clearly to the larger displays, alone photos or videos see on larger displays getting better. Unfortunately, the X 2017 was only available in a diaplay size. I wonder if the people who rummage on the display have even tried the display customization, which can be a big deal. If I do not adjust the Dispaly on the X, the colors look much paler, I use the color filter blue / yellow, which meets my taste perfectly, the colors are much brighter, anyone can try that out for themselves. So then the XR will be brighter and color even more beautiful. The intensity can also be adjusted individually.Conclusion: For me, the XR is a fantastic iphone, whose purchase I would fully recommend, if one adds all the features together, such as the colors, the display size, the excellent processing, camera, chip, design, speakers, etc. Just a little to present case tests , the Stiftung Warentest, of which I think nothing at all, has the XR the drop test there as certified attested and expressly praised. There are simulated in a kind of drum 100 crashes, absolutely unrealistic, considering that a user should fall down the iphone the same number of times. It's like taking a thicker slice. It also breaks down if you only hit it often enough. Personally, an iphone 4 and also a 6 + have each fallen down once a day without significant damage. The Stiftung Warentest makes a sport out of it according to the motto: How do I finally get an iphone broken? And then it is explained in the media: iphone "" so-and-so "" in the case test. A rogue, who thinks that other mobile phones, and of course no iPhones should be favors, that's just populist. As hosts of cheer Android users, but these phones are unfortunately regularly through even in this category. Clearly, the XS should be something, but not so much better, you always have to remember that you have to pay in the comparable memory size 300 ¬ more. The XS Max is great and just in the gold version very noble, but the XR I think because of the colors and not least because of the much cheaper price for even more sexy and as already mentioned, I have the XS Max and therefore actually no reason Favor XR. In the XR, Apple has done the splits between a slightly cheaper and still noble iphone outstanding. One can of course say, why take an XS, if you already have X, but here is not the XS, but the XS Max because of the display size and the improved camera features the attractive iphone, the XR but more interesting. For me, the XR is wrongly underestimated.	1
I ordered the device in color coral yesterday 11 o'clock, today on Saturday 10 o'clock it was in the packing station. CLASS! To the device: I come from the iPhone 8 and have switched to the XR, as I have a larger display and especially an alternative unlock option for Touch ID have searched. I have because of my job as a painter often not the cleanest hands, since it was always a pain to unlock the 6 or 8 by Touch ID. The only option was the PIN, which I then changed to 4 extra places instead of 6 digits. This was too annoying for me. So here with an Apple device with Face ID! The Face ID runs smoothly, you do not even have to look closely and talk - the device is unlocked or passwords are displayed or apps start or apps are downloaded. SIMPLE CLASS! Display: Many moan about the display. I say: nonsense! The display is bright, clean and I do not see a single pixel. I think it's better than the 8th display and I'm completely satisfied! So: I can only recommend the device. The size is not even true in the evening, on the contrary, the "" old "" 4.7 inch iPhones appear immediately tiny again. I have no big hands but I used to have the Galaxy Note devices (up to 4) and so know even a few handles if the smartphone is a bit voluminous.FAZIT: I can only recommend it! The X, or Xs was too expensive for me, so I grabbed the XR and I'm really excited! The price is now Apple typical, but you get synonymous Apple-typical feel, iOS, etc. The skin is already out!	1
** Initial situation ** I had an iPhone SE before, which became too small for me. Due to the highly praised camera in the Xr I just ordered this one. ** Packaging and shipping ** Ordered directly through Amazon, I can not understand such a bad packaging with such an expensive product. The package was crushed outside, the film of the original packaging already half open and on the side of this a small dent. If you order it directly from Apple, it will come in excellent padded delivery !! Note 6 for Amazon. ** Scope of delivery ** The package is very sad, there are only EarPods with Lightning connection, a (short) Lightning on USB-A cable, the paperwork with opening tool and stickers and the well-known 5W power supply, which takes a felt eternity to charge the smartphone. But I'm still glad that no quick charger is there, such a burdened by the high charging currents the battery is very much and shortens its life. ** Processing ** It is really nicely done. The workmanship is impeccable and it feels high quality, not least because of the high weight of almost 200 grams (!) I would recommend to look at it in advance in an Apple Store and take in the hand. The keys do not wobble and have clean pressure points. The white back in my case is really snow white. I like it very much in connection with the silver frame and the black Displayrand.Ohne cover it is very slippery by the aluminum edges. Here is caution announced! But most of them will - as I disappear in a case, then it is absolutely no problem. ** Speed ​​** Undoubtedly a big plus on this iPhone. Websites are loaded very fast, the operation is more than fluent and everything you do with it just feels fast. If one compares an older iPhone or any other current smartphone one will notice a significant difference. Even a 4K video editing and exporting is faster than with many PC's .. ** Camera ** The 12 megapixel main camera makes in daylight very good and detailed photos. In twilight, it does not convince all along and of course, the resolution in 2019 could be higher, I had in 2015 a SonyZ3, which already had 20, x megapixels.The portrait function, which subsequently makes the background "out of focus", convinces me as a hobby photographer only partially. Cropping works only when a face is detected and in backlight portraits it quickly reaches its limits. There you can not see the hairs separated areas and small mistakes. In good light, the results are quite convincing. I would not have thought of this as a defender of "heavy glass" on the heavy camera. A real innovation is not, that could namely the said Sony Z3 already in 2015 - without a face would have been necessary, although by far not in the quality as the Xr.Was I really like, is the video function. You can film in 4K and 60fps with it! The recorded videos have a high degree of detail and convince all along the line. It should be kept in mind that the 64GB version is only partially suitable for this purpose, one minute of 4K 60fps material needs a whopping 400MB of storage space. ** Display ** Unfortunately, the pixel density is quite low compared to the competition. You should have chosen a slightly higher pixel density and everything would be fine, otherwise the display is really good. It is very very bright and quite stable in perspective. The thick edges around the display are not really disturbing and are only noticeable in a direct comparison if it is next to an Xs. The NightShift function is absolutely brilliant and spares the eyes noticeably. The transition from day / night on NightShift can be done automatically after sunrise and sunset. You get used to the display very fast and I do not miss the higher pixel density of the Xs models anymore. I had first set the function "" Display zoom "" to "" enlarged "", unfortunately, this letter is strong fringe and reduces the sharpness of this. If you switch to normal, text works much sharper! ** Battery ** The running time is excellent, even after several hours of phone calls followed by several hours of surfing and playing around the Xr evening even loose 50% and more residual charge. Even frequent users should loose their day, with me there are even two without completely discharging the battery. Very good! In conjunction with an Apple Watch Series 4, the battery life is slightly reduced, but there are still two days drin.Die charging time is as written before very long, but it is no problem at all, because the smartphone usually over anyway is charged at night - and it is even better if it is charged slowly to extend the life of the battery.** Qi charging function ** The Qi charging function is great, I use this with a 20-Euro Qi charging stand anchor, which charges the iPhone when depositing despite a 3-4mm thick shell easily. There's nothing else to keep in mind, it just works. ** Face ID ** For me, as a convert of a Touch ID iPhone, it's pure witchcraft. It works just perfect after the setup, which takes a minute. Whether in the day or in complete darkness, with or without a cap, it always unlocks and it does not annoy. The only downside to Touch ID - if it's at the table, you have to pick it up or pull it to unlock it. Of course you can also enter the unlock code, in a brief review what is but much more undecided than the old with Homebutton.Und sometimes it does not work if you yawn: -) ** Software ** iOS in version 12 is a very stable running and fast operating system, which is known to have some limitations in file transfer and data organization. I get along with it excellently, not least because it forms an unbeatable team in conjunction with an iMac and the data exchange and backup via iCloud. System updates come for years and are installed reliably (at night) without annoying. Some updates are somewhat hidden and can only be detected by trial and error, such as shaking the device to make a call, long press on the spacebar, the app updates are sometimes automatic and partly manual To move the cursor around the screen like a mousepad, long press elements in the control center to get additional options. The best are a few tips and tricks - Watch videos to find all the functions. Unfortunately, the keyboard is not as adaptive as the Google keyboard, but still very easy to use after a bit of familiarization. In iOS13, which comes in the fall of 2019, it should finally support the input through Swipe. That could be the above-mentioned Sony then already. ** Weight and size ** Especially when you come from a small smartphone, the dimensions are gigantic. I have only one pair of jeans in which the Xr fits into the front pockets. The best is to look at it and touch it! The weight is unfortunately very high, with the case it is well over 200 grams. I have never had such a heavy phone.Similar sized devices have an average of about 150 grams. Even my first "" mobile "", a huge Motorola with antenna from the year 2000 was much lighter than this chunk. In any case, one could open his walnuts at Christmas time, if one is too lazy to fetch the nutcracker from the kitchen. ** Audio and co. The voice quality is convincing, as is the reception on the phone. I was able to make calls only at one point in my apartment, now it is almost everywhere. The sound of the speakers is surprisingly good and voluminous and to watch videos absolutely sufficient. For listening to music, there are the supplied EarPods with Lightning plug, which sound good, but not more. Bluetooth connections to my speakers and headphones have a high range and are very stable. Unfortunately, the small Lightning has been saved on jack adapter and must now be purchased separately. The missing headphone jack is just a problem if you want to charge it at the same time and listen to music. CarPlay also works very well, everything is loaded and played quickly. The GPS reception during navigation is excellent. Siri also works reliably on my 2017 Skoda on the push of a button and is usually very useful for entering navigation destinations. I find these Animojis in iMessage very funny, which can be recorded via Face ID and even transmit audio. That's great fun - when people in the circle of friends also use a new generation iPhone. ** Conclusion ** It's hard, very fast, makes great videos, and has a modest display. The price is very high but in my opinion justified. In combination with a Mac and other Apple products, it is almost unbeatable.	1
Yes, APPLE is unfortunately not cheap. But very reliable. The Xr is incredibly fast and the display is great. The criticism of an LCD display, I can not understand. Could hardly find any differences to the OLEDs. OK if I take it close and take a magnifying glass and let me influence other opinions ... And the battery life is very positive !!!	1
Unfortunately, I can not quite understand some other reviews .. Who plays with the idea to buy an iPhone, decides not only for a new cell phone from any manufacturer, but for its own system. I think the pros and cons This system is discussed in other comments or articles on the Internet too much and need not be repeated at this point large. For me, the main reasons why I have opted for an Apple device, that I use since the iPhone 4 Apple phones and always was satisfied with the devices! One knows his apps; can use the purchases from the app store and it just works! You do not have to install other apps for everything again because the player does not play a format or anything like that. I have an Apple TV at home and I think the system is very sophisticated. You can compare that a bit with the difference of a game console to a PC ; you just have to turn on the console and it works! On the PC, you may need to retrofit hardware, update drivers, make settings, etc. This often works in the bottom line, but is far less comfortable. An Apple phone is so convenient that you can, for example. after uploading a backup of the old phones at the web browser can easily read his open web pages, which you have read before och on the old device. Furthermore, for the devices even after years still offered updates and compared to other manufacturers (my wife uses Android ) one does not have the impression that the manufacturer brings a device on the market and then dedicates itself to the successor device and no large resources in the old device puts. This is a purely personal opinion and this can be self-educated! Whether someone uses Apple, should be left to each alone. Since I wanted to replace my Iphone 7 by a successor device from the house of Apple, I waited last autumn first on the new devices. With the presentation of this and in particular the new prices, one swallows as a loyal Apple -Customer already, although everyone is aware that with an Iphone, of course, "" the brand "" paid and not just a normal phone. In this respect, you can not compare apples with pears, that is, for a comparable price you get m.E. When comparing the pure technology values ​​a little less than the competition. I personally need more than 64GB of memory and was more than satisfied with my IPhone 7 with the 128 GB. In this respect, it had to be a device that has more than 64GB and here came only this Iphone XR with 128 GB or just an Iphone XS, but then directly with 256GB into consideration, since there are not the 128GB here. The Iphone XS Max, on the other hand, is just too big for me and far too expensive, so I faced the direct comparison of the XR and the XS.Also you have to look in direct comparison, if you can live with the disadvantages of the XR this mainly the limited camera, since this has only one lens, and just to call the worse display. The price: For my XR I paid 799, - €; The XS I have nowhere cheaper, as seen about 1080 ¬.Since my pain limit was 1000, - €, only the XR came into consideration and it was now the consideration of whether I should get this device at all, or rather one more year with the old device should be satisfied. To hope for that that a successor device from the house of Apple suddenly would be cheaper, in my opinion Utopian! Speaking of purchase price: For used Apple devices you still get quite good prices in resale. This can be considered in his purchase decision so synonymous zuZamera: According to my knowledge, is used in the double lens from Apple in a wide-angle mode and a optical zoom. Quite honestly: If I want to take great photos with an optical zoom, I grab the SLR camera ; their optical zoom is still far better than any cell phone! Why do I use the phone camera? Of course, because you always have the device with you and can take a picture of the children quickly or take something as a video kann.Und this is the camera (ie the existing wide-angle lens) very well suited! For me, the photos are completely sufficient and my compact camera (Canon Ixus) is already in the closet for years, because the mobile phone photos as a replacement are simply too good. In contrast to the Huawei device my wife (P10 with double lens from Leica) makes the camera synonymous with worse light conditions good pictures. So we always take my cell phone, when the light is not so great. But there is still one disadvantage: The portrait mode (bokeh effect), the iPhone can only simulate the camera software. Personally, it bothers me that you can not record objects with this software, only people (if they are not recognized, they do not want to use the effect). I can not imagine why this is technically the case, since the In portrait mode, surely with the tapping of an object, you could specify an area to be sharp while the rest is out of focus. To the display: Yes, I know that the display of the XR used is worse than that of the XS, but it always has still about the same quality as the display of the Iphone 7 or 8 (different size of the display and different resolution, but same pixel density). Therefore, I have juxtaposed and compared both devices in the Applestore. To be honest: Personally, I do see a small difference, if you keep them right next to each other and close, but that does not mean that the XR display is bad! If you want to see the difference, then you see it too; otherwise not! This is not decisive for me because it is still a good display. According to my information, the XS built-in display consumes more power, so the XR has the elegant advantage of keeping the battery longer Battery will definitely last longer than all previous ones! I've been using the same thing during the week for years, so a relatively good comparison is possible. I have never had a battery (even with new devices), which in the evening before the store is still at about 60%! To feel: The XR is slightly larger than the XS, but of course smaller than the XS Max.Für my hands, the size is optimal; but everyone should decide for themselves, if this should be crucial. The weight of a device has never bothered me; I can not understand such statements of other comments. Result: I do not regret the decision to buy the Iphone XR! You get a for Apple conditions (!!) cheap price a great phone! For me, the extra charge for an XS is not worth it and the old technology (skin processor of the Iphone X) I would not have if I buy a new device. The main processors XR, XS and XS Max are all identical and this is great. The missing homebutton was a small change for me, but then you get used to it quickly!	1
Installation went quickly and smoothly. The acquisition of the predecessor phone was great. The new device was detected and all data and files were transferred to the new phone. XR was immediately ready for action.	1
iPhone XR / white / 64GBWhat's too big - yes, something sound - fantastic! Touch - unique! Phone calls - outstanding! Seriously, when the thing came I wanted to exchange it again and ordered directly the 8'er because it is simple and simple was too big, but after two days Ümgang so I'm just excited about the XR. And yes, 192g is not a lightweight compared to the 5SE used before. Nevertheless, after a few phone calls, the decision was firm - the XR is here and stays here. The display is brilliant and the sound of the speakers is a real poem for the ears. The battery keeps feeling eternal despite continuous use (mail, music, Internet, phone and so). In addition, the animated Emoje classes and one more, the thing is just sow fast! The slide functions perfect and the home button I miss now no longer, on the contrary, it almost bothers the other. With missing the CR and 3D touch I've never missed, the feel of touch is enough for me completely. Clear recommendation!	1
So far, I had a Samsung S7, with which I was actually very satisfied. However, I was bothered by the ever longer intervals in which the updates come. So I decided to get a new smartphone. Meanwhile, the prices of the latest smartphones are very close together - at least in the upper price segment. The Samsung smartphone also disturbed me the enormous price decline after 2 years of holding. But the most important aspect for me was getting hardware and software from a single source. In the case of the Iphone, the software is designed just for this brand and is made by the Apple developers in-house, directly cut to the appropriate hardware. In Android, almost every manufacturer has different Android versions on their smartphones after 1-2 years. When dubbing the data on the new Iphone, I found that the data is sometimes on the GoogleCloud, then some again on the SamsungCloud. I like to have everything from a single source and completely coordinated. With Apple and the Iphone I just have a better feeling than with other providers. When I buy a new car, I take everything completely from the manufacturer in the new car and buy not only there the basic equipment and the rest of things in the accessories trade. For me, the security is a great asset and can only m. E. be guaranteed by a complete offer. Conclusion: after a short "" learning phase "" works great with the Iphone XR. And I felt a good sense of security. Incidentally, the price was also right on Amazon!	1
I would like to ask in advance, yes I am an Apple fan, but not blind or blinded. My transition was made by the iPhone 5s on the XR. The display is supposedly not as good as in other phones, that may be the direct comparison, for example. with the Xs / Xs max does not justify my extra price in my opinion. If one takes a current Samsung S or a Huawei eg. P30, the Xr looks a bit old-fashioned at first sight. But that does not bother me so much that the inner values ​​are really good. Face iD works absolutely fast and reliable. In normal use, the battery is enough for me 2 days. What I like well is the ability to use eSim so you can use for example an O2 and a Vodafone sim. There is even the possibility of the voice line of zb. O2 separate from the Vodafone data line. Direct parallel operation is not possible. The only drawback is the position of the keys, something that probably would not have happened under Steve Jobs. Since the loud and quiet keys are opposite the power button, it happens to me quite often that I unintentionally take a screenshot. Otherwise, I have nothing to complain about, a total of a very good overall package of hard and Software.Kaufempfehlung	1
I bought this smartphone for Christmas, because I've wanted one for a long time. It was about 80 ¬ cheaper than Apple, which is why I struck. The iPhone came 7 days earlier than predicted and it came in perfect original package. The camera is similar, as with the X, but one sees differences. With 64GB you are completely equipped, as these are totally sufficient. The iPhone is for all savers just a recommendation, as it is not really worse than the X and even bigger.	1
The best iPhone today. With the display one sees no difference to the Xs even with direct comparison. But the battery lasts much longer. With weak use I get up to 3 days without battery charge.	1
For my claims! Coming from the iPhone 7, the xr puts everything in the shade. After I gave my wife the xr in color red due to a display break of her iP 7 for Christmas and was allowed to play around with it a bit, for me it was clear: I have to have.I'm in the local Apple shop, I've looked at the individual "x-er" times and my original purchase decision überacht.Geplant was actually the purchase of the xs due to the supposedly superior display and the smaller Gehäuse.Klar, on the The amoled display is vastly superior to paper and in numerous YouTube videos. Black, resolution and contrast are of course great, but as with my previous Samsung S6, the parts also have their downsides, in the truest sense of the word. I do not like these discolorations at all white surfaces at different angles.For xs not nearly as bad as the Samsung, but still existing.Pen tile matrix, height resolution only on paper, so to speak for Poser.Das inferior Lc display I like better, yes everyone can see it differently.Face ID works perfectly like everything else and leaves nothing to my desires.Hab's me in red fetched in black it would have been more expensive. But is still the most beautiful color, a dark blue, yes unfortunately nicht.Grund for the change of the iP 7 was mainly the weakening battery, I'm looking forward to the perseverance of xr in everyday life. My wife is thrilled and invites her only every two days. The workmanship and the feel are Apple typical, know nothing better. I'm with the device so far very satisfied and can recommend the closer look and try each. LGAndreas	1
Who whines here, who spins ;-) the smartphone is absolutely great. I switched from the iPhone 7 to the XR and loved it without limit. Top boost, insane photos, great colors, great display. There is nothing to complain about! Any time.	1
If you first recovered from the Apple typical price shock has a great device! I can not even understand the criticisms of the display in the least. I am very satisfied with the quality and brightness! The workmanship is top what you can probably ask for the price. Another plus point is the IOS which needs a settling in, if you come from an Android phone, but then you are super satisfied and you would not want to miss it anymore! For me, the change from Android to Apple was worthwhile and was a pure joy. What was also an important point is the battery life and there is the Xr also world class in it! I would buy it anytime again!	1
I have to say quite honestly, I am thrilled! Delivery was as always very fast, but was to be expected, I do not know otherwise from Amazon. The yellow is just so beautiful and in my opinion, for this iPhone the best color ever. The cell phone is without shell super in hand, so you could use it with one hand, as I had larger phones that were more cumbersome. Maybe that's why I can not share the opinion that it should be full. The size so perfect. FaceID works flawlessly and is just great! I had never had a cell phone which I could unlock as quickly and easily as das.Die data transfer from the old to the new cell phone was super easy of hand and was within 20 minutes about completely fertig.Ich it's only been a few hours and I am so in love. I can recommend it to everyone! Here was written in advance so much about the phone that I have nothing more to say. Top and all the thumbs up!	1
Great part. Have fun working with it. Lies well in the hand and has all the advantages of networking with my other Apple products. Outstanding are the long battery life, face recognition instead of fingerprint and the extremely fast response time.	1
Am still completely satisfied after a few weeks of use. It makes great photos and the display is also ok and nice and big. Inductive charging also works with standard equipment, with which one can also load the competing products. The color selection is lush and the rich red is beautiful. I have not dived into the water and will avoid that. The abandonment of the home button is easy to get over and Face-ID works mostly. Thumbs up - I did not expect anything more!	1
At first I had my doubts, whether the purchase on Amazon is a good idea, because I found it very strange that the price here was a lot cheaper than the directly over Apple. But I've been using this iPhone XR for a few months now and I'm absolutely thrilled! There is nothing to complain about, the phone came very quickly in my original packaging and works perfectly. Very clear purchase recommendation!	1
Great thing! My first iPhone, I switched from Andoid. Anyone who sees a slightly overpriced product to buy, the expected top quality. Despite the relatively low resolution, the display beats the competition in terms of brilliance by far. I personally like the color of the Xr even a little more than that of the Xs. The functionality of iOS over Andoid is also awesome. Of course not recommended for modders. Otherwise, you get what you expect for the price too.	1
After I switched to iOS with the 5s 6 years ago and I also tried out current Android devices, I wanted to get an iPhone again despite the prices. Although I could afford it, I do not see 4-digit amounts for a cell phone and am also completely satisfied with the XR. The display, which is often seen as the biggest drawback, despite the resolution is absolutely satisfactory for a LCD. The rest, there are enough tests and after I had the Xr in my hand, I would not know why I would have 300+ euros for an Xs I would buy it anytime again. But what I have to get rid of is the way it was sent from Amazon. The phone was thrown into a box and sent. No packaging material - nothing. Absolutely unacceptable to send a product for 800 euros and save on any type of upholstery for 10 cents. The box was already slightly dented on the outside and if the iPhone packaging even the slightest bruise by shipping could be seen, I would have sent it back. Shipping as always fast, but that was the last cell phone that I bought at Amazon .Da because it is the product, I do not deduct a star, but only for the display resolution (even if the best LCD) and of a good price-performance ratio, you can not speak, but who buys an iPhone , knows that before.	1
First: Switch from a OnePlus 5t (Android) because broken. Super simple cell phone and a pleasant size. I have previously been largely informed and am very happy with the features of the iPhone. In the subject of display resolution, I had thought I'm going back to something worse, but in everyday life, I notice nothing. The camera is synonymous top. In terms of security, the iPhone is worlds better than Android. My conclusion so far Top cell phone and super system interface.	1
I have now ordered the Xr and have tested it often before and looked good. That it is not exactly like the Xs is clear to me and that has also been said several times by Apple and I do not understand the 1 star recessions since it is enough for everyday life and it also makes very nice pictures. Sure the LCD panel is not as good as the OLED but it does not bother me at all. The price is still too high for me but on the whole a very nice and great smartphone that is also very good in the hand!	1
Previously I had the iPhone 6s and then decided to buy a new phone after over 3.5 years. At first I thought the iPhone XR would be smaller and was a bit surprised when I opened and unpacked the package. However, I'm positively surprised because I thought I never want a bigger phone than the iPhone 6s. You quickly get used to the size and also to the new operation without Homebutton. I like to take pictures and am absolutely satisfied with the picture quality. I can only recommend the iPhone XR. The only sticking point with Apple are leather prices but compared to the iPhone XS, the iPhone XR is a good "" cheaper "" alternative.	1
I opted for the XR because I did not see nearly 500, - Euro more spend for the X. I have had the iPhone 6 so far and deliberately skipped a few generations. It was worth it. The price of 729, - at Amazon convinced and was 120, - Euro below the list price (64GB). I got lost for the blue version because I was slowly fed up with black and silver. It is a really nice, Edelbert blue tone on the aluminum frame. The phone gets but still a Schutzhülle.Einrichtung was super Easy without cable connection. All data was taken over perfectly. I say top and recommend the product at any time!	1
Great, the best iphone I've ever had.	1
Picture quality, also in comparison to the XS, good. Price / performance, at least after the price reductions, my own still appropriate.Einziger serious criticism for me - very smooth. I immediately got a transparent silicone cover (although I really do not like cover at all). But without slipping the part of any smooth surface, or even out of hand.	1
I do not want to write much on the phone. Have it since Christmas and am extremely satisfied, I have it in red and I like it really well. Have not regretted the switch from Samsung Galaxy one second! Simple operation extremely good battery, enough 3 days although I have since I own the phone it much use.	1
First and foremost - Friday evening ordered, Saturday afternoon delivered - I'm really excited! Now to the topic: I switched from the iPhone 8 to the XR. At first I was skeptical; I have relatively small hands and thus the fear that I could have my problems with so much of it. But that is actually not so, I get along well with the size of the iPhone. The display is great, the camera makes great pictures and Face ID works optimally (even so I had my doubts). So far I have nothing to complain about and can unreservedly recommend!	1
I am very satisfied! My favorite color is yellow now I finally found my matching mobile phone. I had the iPhone 7 before. Of course it's a huge difference, just for the big one. I love Faceid everything works fine even in the dark. With the battery, I can easily through the day that was not the case with the 7th. More than satisfied that I have decided on this phone :-)	1
An awesome part! It should be self-evident that a 850 Euro expensive mobile phone has no sharp edges and in the hand does not feel like a gadget from the gumball machine, just because there are two more expensive X-versions in the smartphone triumvirate. Here you do not have to worry about the iPhone XR. Apple's most affordable iPhone is built with the utmost care and boasts a high-quality feel and fine details. With a 6.1-inch format, the iPhone XR fits between the iPhone X and the iPhone XS Max. In everyday life, it can often, but not always with one hand. The also made of glass back supports wireless charging, but is prone to fingerprints.First conclusion: The cheapest iPhone is actually as noble as the iPhone XS. Due to the colors and the colored frame, it is even a little fancier for some people.	1
There is probably not much to say - fast delivery, good quality, the child has a newer model than the parents and is soulful ... the school and homework are still not neglected, especially the large display and that on this model new incoming messages pointed out but not parts of the text to be displayed is great.	1
A review is a personal opinion. I already had some I Phones and got one again. Actually, I wanted to take another smartphone because an Apple is very expensive. After using another phone for a year, I bought the XR and am really happy to have an I Phone again. It's just like that Apple is always Apple. I do not want to miss it anymore. If you like it will agree with me who not not. For my needs and applications, it is always enough (as it would have done a cheaper).	1
The iPhone XR is a great device, super processed, ultra-fast, has a very good battery, makes realistic and sharp photos and is simply an Apple device. The quality is just extremely good. The display is good, but not quite as colorful as the OLED displays. Still, I would definitely buy it again. After all, this increases the battery performance and videos should not look anyway on such small displays.	1
I'm thrilled with the iPhone XR! 2 days of battery life is really awesome. The display is nice and big.	1
So far so good! It’s a little bit more chunkier than my iphone 6 plus but nevertheless it’s great! The picture quality is superb.	1
The best IPhone I ever had. The battery keeps loose for 2 days with me. The photos are very good, everything runs smoothly and without dropouts, the display is great (I can not understand the partially voiced criticism), everything sharp and rich in contrast. The price is high, of course, but the performance too. Clear Buy recommendation	1
As I know it from iPhone. In itself top on the subject of security. The price is just a status symbol	1
Perfect	1
Am an absolute fan of Appel and therefore can hardly say anything negative. Clearly about the PRICE can be argued, but think you get a great and incredibly fast Phone!	1
Do not understand the negative reviews, I am very satisfied!	1
Yes top cell phone but the price drops even more .. topical, original iPhone product you should beat as long as it is possible ... who wants to have a good cell phone should treat it and it only 1 year warranty benefits and not two years if you buy it directly through Apple ..	1
I'm not an IP expert, but that's a great part! Have not regretted	1
The new IPhone XR I can only recommend. The camera is great and the battery lasts 3 times as long as my iPhone 6S plus.	1
Price performance is in the XR much better than the XS, image quality is very good compared to an Iphone 7, there is plenty of memory and beautiful colors. One minus the part is compared to Android phones still a bit expensive, 100-200 would be less fair.	1
Who knows the iPhone does not want anything else. Top device, quick to set up. Only the price always deters something. Since I use my IPhones over 5 years relativize this	1
With my order were no headphones with it?!	1
Although the difference between Android and iOS has narrowed in recent years, I think there is still an advantage to IOS in terms of quality and usability.	1
Product as described, fast delivery.	1

I purchased the XR with 64GB per contract extension and I'm thrilled with the device ever since. I do not want to stretch the review, the Specs are known. The fact is that the phone gives a very high quality and noble impression. I think it's nice that the displays are now color-independent in black. The processing is great and everything is placed as usual except for the sim card slot, which now sits further down. About the display and its resolution is and was a lot of barking, absolutely unnecessary and unobjective. It is very pleasant to look at it, resolution totally ok and adequate. More is not really necessary as the human eye has its limits. The longer the battery life. I come with normal use on 2 days. The XR has stereo speakers and they sound very full and even with noticeable or audible bass. Software is as good as usual and consistently fast and should receive about 5 years of updates. Face ID works perfectly and puts you in a good mood. The main camera takes very good pictures and is the iPhone X in spite of only one lens in no way. Otherwise .... Wireless charging works well, size of the phone is borderline but just ok. In summary, a perfect all-rounder. The iPhone also seems to be relatively scratch-resistant. Use it without sheath and without bulletproof glass. The aluminum frame is better suited than the stainless steel frame of the X or XS. Only the price is typically very high Apple but in a few months, the part should be around for the 700 ¬ werden.Klare recommendation on my part.	1
What a great phone. Super service from Amazon.	1
First of all: I got my iPhone XR in the Apple Store. I do not understand all the reviews here about the iPhone XR? This is now my third iPhone within 6 years. My last one was an iPhone 6S with 64GB. I had the iPhone 6S 3 1/2 years long. And then I decided to pick that iPhone XR. The first reason why I chose this iPhone is because I do not always swim with the crowd want. I did not want to have a phone which everyone has. Then I think it's great that there is now Face-ID instead of the Home Button. Handy is unlocked in seconds. Then the color: I like the color really well. It looks really classy and she does what. Then to the size of the iPhone: it is clear at the beginning it is unusual to have a 6.1 inch (15.5 cm in the diagonal) display. My iPhone 6s had 4.7 inches (11.94 inches in diagonal) you can tell it's a big difference. Nevertheless, I find that it is very comfortable in the hand that an iPhone XR, where I have not the biggest hand !!!! To the camera: I find the camera just the first cream. Better than my old one. I'm always fascinated what great photos can come out of it, if you take the time, and deals with the camera. For the battery life: with normal use, it creates a runtime of two days. (Have only been three weeks) To top it all off: I am completely satisfied with the iPhone XR. And would recommend it anytime.	1
First of all, I got the iPhone XR at the Apple Store in Munich, as I was able to exchange my old 7s for a credit of 250 €. Thus I have for the XR "" only "" paid 600 €. I will try to organize my review as clearly as possible.1. Display - the biggest criticism: Why is the display so criticized? Clearly for 850 €, a 4k display or at least Full HD display must be installed. Or? Not quite. The display is absolutely sharp and has earned no negative criticism in my eyes. You often see that the testers zoom as close as possible to the screen with the eye or the camera in order to guess a few pixels. This shows me that the alleged problem with the display is purely psychological.2. Battery - the biggest selling pointThe battery of the iPhone XR is really sensational for an iPhone. For a Samsung, rather average. 2 full days without charging the phone is no problem. In this respect, absolutely fine.3. HardwareThree gigabytes of RAM (memory) sounds in comparison with the competition like Samsung (Apple is always compared with Samsung, but you can take any other manufacturer) miserably little. In fact, 3GB of RAM is not just enough, but most phones have 8GB of RAM. Why? The iOS operating system is perfectly tailored to the device. While Android has to run on any mobile, iOS only has to run on iPhones. This means that the hardware and software are so perfectly matched that iPhones run much faster with much less technology than the competition. The processing of the housing is of course impeccable, as always. Not to say, absolutely perfect. As a port for data transfer and charging, a Lightning port, which I personally personally prefer a thousand times, serves as a shaky USB Type-C port. And juhu, inductive charging is also thanks to the glass back :) Incidentally, the "" thick "" display margins only relevant for the first 5 minutes, then you can not see them anymore.At first I thought that they would disturb me a lot, but as I said, after 5 minutes they were forgotten.4. SoftwareWho wonders why iPhones and the rest of Apple is always so expensive, has never thought about the software. In addition to Pages, Keynote and Numbers (Apple's counterpart to Word, Powerpoint and Excel), which are FULLY FREE, it offers years of free updates. At that time I always had Android phones and they were no longer supplied with updates after 2 years at the latest. And if you have ever tried to make a full backup of an Android phone, you know why Apple is ahead in terms of software! Value for moneyHello Apple ?! Are you crazy ?! 850 € for the part? That's how I thought at the beginning. Thankfully, my love of technology won and I bought the XR anyway. After a few days of use and playing around, I came to the conclusion that the iPhone XR is worth every penny! Above all, if one knows the abnormally high resale value of Apple products. Glass Glass, Spiderapp! The XR not only has front glass installed, but also rear. What does that mean? Right. Silicon case and bulletproof screen protectors are required.7. The color selection I stood in the Apple Store for almost 45 minutes and had no plan which color to buy. In the end, it has turned yellow and I'm not sorry, thank God. BUT: look at the colors before in real, because these are much stronger in the pictures. In real, the colors look rather washed out, but still nice.8. Purchase recommendation A buy recommendation is on my part definitely. This device will certainly be my companion for the next 4 years and will perform its job excellently. Camera top, display top, battery top, software top, design top. Price performance grade 1.6.	1
Well, I do not understand the reviews on the phone at all. The predecessor of the XR was a 7+. I wanted to cry because I sold it and read some of the XR's "" modest "" reviews before it arrived. First of all, I want to see something on my phone! That it Navi, video player etc. is. As above, I had the 7+, the size, I do not complain about it, in any way, I do not feel unwieldy. Comfortable gazing without guessing, even if you do not have glasses at once, you can see something. I had to bridge 14 days with the iPhone 4S ..., then I appreciate the screen size again correctly! I thought I expected a lesser quality ... The screen is crisp, sharp, fine - I do not know where I should put the point of criticism ... I have been working with Apple displays in many variations since 2005. So I still respected enhanced on the screen quality with the XR. She is awesome ... The battery life is brilliant, fantastically long. The camera very fine! The speakers - I no longer rumble JBL, I use the iPhone speakers right away. Face ID wonderful, I do not miss the homebutton. For me, the XR is just as great as the 7+, only with modern technology. The XS is too small compared to the XR, the XS max much too big, because I can do the same take an iPad. XS and XS max with the same settings as the XR looked as if the Night Shift was turned on. The best screen for me was the XR. So I am a happy iPhone XR owner!	1
I like to make photos	1
First of all, I have not purchased the iPhone XR (yellow, 256 GB) via Amazon. I have the device now a good 3 months in use and think that I now have enough experience to objectively evaluate the device. I had before the XR an iPhone X, which I have sold because of the poor battery life, however. This is also a huge advantage of the XR over the X called. I use my smartphone on average a lot, a bit messaging, mailing, surfing, shopping, rarely even a game. The iPhone calls an average display time of about 1.5 hours per day.When used, the XR needs to be recharged every 3-4 days. My X had in new condition every 1.5 days to the power - with the same usage. Of course - the longer battery life is also due to the supposedly "worse" display. But is the display really bad? I do not think so, because there are some advantages: Unlike the X (S), the XR does not have an OLED, but a cheaper LCD display (the technology behind this is Apple's Liquid Retina ). This is reflected in the resolution - at least on paper - noticeable: While the two current XS devices with 458 pixels per inch (ppi) provide much sharper view, remains the XR with its pixel density of 326 ppi, almost at the level of its predecessor iPhone 8. In everyday life, this is absolutely not on. In direct comparison with an XS, so you lay the iPhone side by side, yes, there you see the difference. The black levels of the top model does not reach the XR and the contrasts in poor lighting are less clear, BUT in strong sunlight is the display of the XR For me, the display of the iPhone XR is absolutely sufficient and the thick edges disturb me in the smallest way. The often criticized "clunkiness" I feel rather than positive. I have the XR, as mentioned, bought as a successor to my X and am completely satisfied. In the end, everyone has to decide for themselves whether the "benefits" of the XS an extra charge of around EUR 300. I deliberately opted for the XR because it offers the best price / performance ratio (Apple) for my personal requirements and I have no regrets. The photos of the XR are absolutely great, the battery life is excellent and who can do without 3D Touch , is in my view with the XR in the Apple World in excellent hands. From me an absolute buy recommendation.	1
I bought the iphone for just over 700 €. I chose Apple because the latest models from Samsung and Huawei have actually been more expensive. The iPhone 8 Plus would have been more expensive. So much for the price in comparison to the competition with similarly strong devices. First of all: I am more than satisfied with my decision. The smartphone is processed typically outstanding Apple. Although has a decent weight, but is like a piece - very high quality! Also, the 6.1 inches of the screen are for me rather a plus rather than a minus point. I had a 5.5 inch phone before. Logically, the screen is larger, but the device itself is smaller than my previous one. It fits well in the hand and can be operated with one hand. I think the size, for me at least, just right. Also that one uses now the complete screen and the Homebutton is gone is super. The much discussed display goes in my opinion completely in order. Somewhere, just to the big brother money had to be saved. Of course, I would have preferred synonymous rather oled, but still this is a reasonable display. Everything is very nicely presented, has great colors and is bright enough. In my opinion the best thing about the XR is the camera. Although I have not done so much so far, but what I have seen was consistently outstanding. Quite great photos - of course, rich in detail, beautiful colors, but not too much of the good as with other manufacturers of the case. The portrait mode really makes very nice pictures and also the video quality is impressive. The most ingenious thing about the whole thing is: what others do not get baked at five, gets the XR out with a single lens. That just has to be embarrassing for one or the other. What just made me a little disappointed was the speakers. But even here I have not been able to test extensively. So far they have not been "round" enough for me. Although okay and stereo, but not as loud and clear as I expected, or the quality decreases with increasing volume. But it is quite different with headphones. This is really an experience - comparable to a visit to the cinema. Even at high volume flawless, it's really fun to hear about the things music or watching movies. Another plus is the battery. He is holding and holding and holding and just will not get empty. Here you have done a really good job. The battery was not even half full and I judge and test since yesterday constantly - he still shows over 20%. Conclusion: Nothing on the phone is really bad. Everything moves between good and very good and I'm really positively surprised what the stripped-down X version can do. With this huge price difference, clear buy recommendation from me.	1
I chose the iPhone XR as the successor to my Galaxy S8 because I was dissatisfied with Android System. I do not regret the change after nearly 3 weeks. The battery life which was very important to me is paramount and the whole performance is just a dream. I can tell everyone about a change only to the heart.	1
I have only used Android so far (Samsung S2 and A5 2015) and found it pretty well - except for the updates. They did not exist. Android is cheaper, but the updates justify the extra cost of Apple. To the iPhone XR: The screen is great, the battery lasts a long time (three days with 2 hours of screen usage per day). The photos are very good, whereby I take the really important photos with the SLR. The size is o. K., Although it could be smaller and lighter. But you arrange yourself. The utility value is very high, the phone just works just reliable, without stuttering, good apps. I do not know if I switch back to Android, only if the update policy gets better.	1
I did not buy this iphone from Amazon this time but from Saturn. I have followed the recommendation of Stiftung Warentest and have never regretted this. I thought OK You'll be disappointed and then you want the XS but it was not like that. The screen is bright and the letters are sharp. The camera is great. Videos a dream and using the included software to edit immediately. The battery lasts 2 days with me (I do not have it that much in my hand) The phone never crashes thanks to the OS software !!!! I am thrilled and surely there is not something for everyone. Because it is expensive. But if you have the opportunity to acquire it anyway, you can resell it super one day. The screen is big enough for games and movies. I do not get a cent for this review.	1
This is in my opinion the best currently available smartphone on the market. Have it been in use for 4 months and everything is true, except that since the update, the battery life has decreased, there is nothing to complain about. The best cell phone I have so far , the price should give you something to think about..clearly. But otherwise you do not do anything wrong with the purchase of the iPhone XR	1
I am already a longtime Apple customer, the switch from my Iphone 7 to the XR was definitely very good. I own the phone now since 31.10.2018, which still amazes me, is the battery, this holds CLEARLY longer than the Iphone 7 and was the main reason for the change. Compared to my even older Iphone 6 I would even say, the battery lasts more than twice as long. Furthermore, I am very convinced of the phone boxes, these are really extremely loud for a cell phone and it I really enjoy using my phone very much to watch videos, which is why a cell phone in this size is very suitable for me, you have to know of course what you use your cell phone, but people the small cell phones prefer such as the Iphone SE, rather wait a bit I think this is not optimal for you. The Bildqulität is normal, now not overly better or worse than be i other Iphones, who is satisfied with the resolution of the Iphone 8, it will be absolutely synonymous with the XR. According to the technical data, the display offers a "too low" resolution on which all Apple hater fall naturally like the vulture around the phone bad to talk. Here you have to say very clearly, PEOPLE do not let you influence this anti-apple propaganda, the phone has a very very good screen, everything looks great even if it can not keep up with the number of pixels with other phones, vlt numbers In tests where people were presented with 2 taped cell phone displays, one of which was the Iphone Xr, all were totally thrilled. It is physically proven that you can only see at a distance of 30 cm from Eye to display differences in resolution can detect, and each user has his cellphone in normal use not less than 30cm in front of the face, because it does not matter whether the pixel number 1 00 times as high.	1
Have the phone over my provider. I would still like to describe my impression. The mobile phone is perfectly processed. The display is excellent despite all the doom calls. It is wonderfully readable and perfectly usable even in bright sunshine. The speed is outstanding. The camera makes top photos. but as Ottonormal I'm completely thrilled. If you do not want Android anymore, the XR is a real alternative.	1
I bought the iPhone XR 2 weeks ago and wanted to report that I just overflowed the shower and my phone was on the ground .. it was completely surrounded by water and works absolutely flawlessly. Really not promised too much, top waterproof I can only recommend!	1
For years Samaung and Huawei had had. For a week I own the iPhone XR. What can I say? Performance, battery and the camera are just awesome. The pixel density I personally find much too low for a smartphone in 2019. But I do not mind. The 3D face recognition works without problems and is very fast. I can recommend the smartphone even if you have to do without some features such as the 3D Touch	1
All the best, what more do you want for 800 euros Have the iPhone for 6 months in use and has proven itself well!	1
I'm really excited! previously had the Samsung Galaxy S8 + which was really top but the iphone xr is something completely different again	1
I was also critical at the beginning, had an S9 before. At first I had the feeling that the display is not that dissolving. But you get used to it and after a time is quite good. It could be a bit narrower. But otherwise it does what it should. Battery power and just a great sound quality, because the S9 could not keep up. Without my contract extension I would not have bought it. A good solid phone.	1
It arrived very fast. Everything works fine. I have the white device one sees no fingerprints and looks very elegant. In very satisfied.	1
Can you buy the mobile phone on finance	1
Is the mobile phone open to all networks?	1
This is an apparatus	1
I buy a new smartphone at least once a year. Last year I had an iPhone X, meanwhile a huawei p20 pro and now an iPhone Xr in blue. I made the purchase via Telekom and am so far very satisfied. It seems to me a very good iPhone to be a fair price compared to the other Xs and Xs Max. The display is, in spite of all bad reviews, completely ok, but in no case bad. Sure, the iPhone X is sharper and more brilliant. But the display of the Xr is good enough. Who says it was bad, it has not had in the hand, no idea or just goes to the data sheet. The camera is great, the general performance without jerking and without long waiting times. The battery is awesome. I use my smartphones very intensively and have between 30 and 50% after one day. For skeptics: I'm a techie and do not get any money for this recession. I wrote it freely.	1
I switched from the iPhone 7 and had last year already considered, which I should take. The change to 8 would hardly have paid off. The X I found for what it is clearly too expensive. My ideas were: 64gb memory too low, slightly larger display, with one hand still operable, a very good camera, technically sufficient for the next few years and ultimately, if possible, a slightly better Battery life. I was lucky and was able to test the iPhone XR, X and XS for a few days each. After that it was clear, it will definitely be the XR. It is certainly a matter of opinion, I had the Galaxy S7 in front of the iPhone and thus know the Amoled Display years ago. For this I have to say, however, that I've missed it already at 7 in the smallest way. I think the LCD panel is even more comfortable for the eye. My reasons for the XR were in the end more versatile as thought.- for me the size is right and even if it weighs a few grams more, it's still lighter like the 8plus and also a little bit smaller (I can handle it with one hand) - I am not bothered by the slightly wider margin (will not bother anyone who did not have the X before) - very good camera (even in the evening if it is a bit worse light) - ultra fast and fluid in the operation faceID is not so used to get used to as the XR and felt a bit faster than the X- the battery life is by far the best I could ever reach with a smartphone 128gb memory offers no other current iPhone - at least 300 euros extra charge in my eyes, not the purchase an XS-not as vulnerable as the XSThe negative arguments are therefore limited: - no 3DTouch (but is partially replaced by Haptictouch- altogether t is a little too expensive but still worth its money. In summary, it can be said that ein has brought a really good smartphone on the market here, which in my opinion, the premium devices in many ways nachsteht.Von me because of a whole clear buy recommendation.	1
Honestly, I had reservations before buying because the display was criticized because it has a smaller pixel density than the Iphone Xs and Xs Max. However, I have dared to buy and found that the display resolution is more than adequate! That part has the best LCD display what Apple has ever installed in a smartphone. Now, some are wondering why I prefer the Xr to the X. I have decided so because Oled displays tend to einbrennen.Da I the device about 5 years (Apple's update policy is thanks), my decision fell on the XR and I have not looked back! In addition, the battery life is phenomenal, I can easily get through the day (Facebook, whatsapp, Netflix, Games ect!) For these reasons I highly recommend this device, especially because it "only" costs € 795 instead of € 850 (as of 11.1.2019). And I stress it here again: If you are still worried about the display resolution, please test the device on site and you'll see how ridiculous the whole "hate" against the display is. Best regardsA happy iPhone user	1
The Dislpay is very good in my opinion, the battery is great! The price is not justified, okay, but Apple phones are just luxury goods, such as. a Mercedes AMG, because you can argue with the price also. I have to say that I'm not an "Apple fanboy", because it is my 1st iPhone. The change from Android to IOS was unfortunately difficult.P.S. Please do not buy apps to transfer contacts. One can add in the attitudes and the point "accounts" its Google account and then the contacts are also transferred. I can only recommend the Handy, it is really great.	1
The iPhone XR is a very special Apple iPhone. It accomplishes a few technical masterpieces in the balancing act. At the beginning, it was difficult to judge whether to reject or accept it. The technical specifications are known, the corresponding meaningless discussions also, so that they are completely superfluous. It is a very good large 6.1 inch smartphone weighing just under 200 grams. Therefore, it is a smartphone for two-handed operation. There is the so-called "one-hand mode" in the accessibility, which can be additionally switched on. This helps only conditionally, since not all apps are currently adapted to the new iPhone design. I've spent far too long trying to come up with pros and cons to help me make the purchase decision before buying the iPhone XR. This approach has clearly failed, in the end it was predominantly an emotional purchase and Apple's marketing concept is fully on my mind. I took a close look at the iPhone XR and checked that it fits well in your hand and that it still fits in your pocket with its size. Furthermore, I compared the Liquid Retina Display with the displays of the iPhone XS, XS Max and the X to test whether the LC display is noticeably worse than the OLED displays of the other iPhones. Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that the difference is marginal and plays only a minor role in day-to-day operations. If one compares the XR to the XS and XS Max, the price differences and orders of magnitude have been decisive in order to favor the XR. If I compare the XR with the X, the main differences here are the dualsim support and the really good stereo sound for the XR. Who hangs on the OLED display, that said that the OLED displays are mostly supplied by Samsung and therefore probably the mark-up is correspondingly high. Furthermore, the problem with the OLED burn-in is still not solved technically, so that nobody can guarantee that after a long time the OLED displays will not cause any problems. iOS is maintained and updated by Apple for an average of five years per device generation. For a smartphone in this price range, I'm not ready to take that risk. If OLED smartphone then any model, which definitely does not last longer than two years. This is one of the technical advantages of the LC display of the XR, because these displays can not burn.Where is the real advantage of OLED to LC? There is a bit more color spectrum than pure sRGB, something from the DC3 range. It's still a smartphone and not a TV or home theater replacement. Now on the subject of no Full HD: Apple has never followed the usual industry standards for its iPhones, so why should you do it now? The X, XS and XS Max also do not conform to any standard but exceed it. Apple has finally finally applied its iPhone concept to the XR again. The human eye can no longer detect individual pixels, with a PPI value of over 300. Thus, the iPhone XR does not look blurred. Technically, smartphones with 8K displays would be possible today. But this is completely superfluous because the human eye can no longer detect a difference. Furthermore, each pixel requires power, so the battery life would be correspondingly short on an 8K display. The iPhone XR has the brightest display and the longest battery life of the entire X series. If you criticize the number of pixels of the LC display compared to the OLEDs, you should continue to use the term "Pentilematrix". For reasons of cost, the Samsung OLEDs have only two subpixels per pixel, and the LC display of the XR has three subpixels. Another aspect for the XR could be the lower number of pixels to be controlled in future, because the A12 has to spend less computing power on the XR than the higher number of pixels of the OLEDs. If you complain about the thicker edge of the XR screen, let's say that Apple has done an absolute pioneering job with its suppliers. No other smartphone has so far been fitted with an LC display with such a narrow edge. Long story short, the iPhone XR is a very good and appreciated smartphone. Is it worth the price? In view of the technical pioneering work and the advanced, but still quite perfected features clearly yes. The XR is said to be more robust than the other X-iPhones. Are there any negative aspects? Definitely! The iPhone XR is really comfortable to use only with two hands. The chic glass back ensures that the iPhone XR slips down the slightest slope, so you have to be very careful with it and at best always use a protective cover.	1
The iPhone was a lot cheaper in the yellow color than e.g. in black. Here I got the yellow with 256 GB for the price of a black with 128 GB. In hindsight, I have to say that the color is really great. So, let's compare the prices between different colors, sp uSU u.U. save some more or more memory for the money. To the iPhone itself, there is not much to say, the performance limitations compared to the model X are acceptable and justify the price difference	1
One informs oneself in advance of a purchase and with this information, the phone is as expected. Just a real iPhone with the usual advantages of iOS. The camera is a clear step in the picture quality compared to the previous iPhone 6. Face ID is new and works perfectly smoothly. Battery life also seems much better.	1
So I am absolutely thrilled. Fast delivery via Amazon. Had a 7er before and am now switched to the XR. Handling super. Image quality, I think is perfectly fine, Face ID works great. Can not find anything negative and I have deliberately opted for the XR. I am an average consumer and I am thrilled. Apple costs, you should be aware of that. I would decide again.	1
I do not want to comment on the iPhone XR here. There are countless informative reviews. Clearly the price is never worth 5 stars at Apple, but that does not hurt the device. I want to express myself here primarily to the color. Coral uses my wife. It always looked a bit "" pink "" or pink on pictures, but in fact it looks like we are a pastel orange. Very nice indeed. The aluminum frame has a bit of the rose gold of the known devices. I'm surprised how good it looks. It's (in my opinion) not just a woman's color.	1
Had tried a Mi Note7, came with the software but not well. Before, I had an iPhone 5S. Switched on, installed in 5 minutes, flawless. Fast delivery, well packed, original. Everything as it should be. Of course, playing in a different league than the 5S. Am thrilled.	1
The XR is already expensive, but in my experience with the iPhone 4 (is still used today - with the first battery) and the 6S plus (is also still used), I assume that this XR will accompany me for many years and it already pays off. The quality and reliability I just love! For my purposes the 64 GB are enough - the 6S plus has 128 GB, but I did not need it at any time.	1
Hello, After a long time I decided to buy the IPhone XR. At the beginning I had the slightly wider edge compared to the XS very disturbed but I have to say, you get used to it quickly. On the whole, I find it very successful even if the price of 777 ¬ for my feelings but is very high, but that is one now (unfortunately) used by Apple.	1
A cool device. I come from an SE. Initially, it has been unusual to operate a much larger device. But after days, it is more like the SE acts like a toy. Face ID is really great. Thousand times better than Touch ID, which is great too. I bought the XR with 256 GB for 889 Euro here on Amazon. One week later, they ask for 979. I probably got the perfect time.	1
Have been a long time iPhone user, since the 3G and it was better for each model. I have it in red and I love the design! It looks so awesome that you can not keep your eyes off. Display is great and not worthy of the bad reviews. The size is perfect and the weight synonymous ok. Can recommend it unreservedly. Did it get for 770 ¬ with 64GB. At the moment it is more expensive again.	1
The iPhone XR is just great. Had a few predecessors, but the size is just awesome! I am very satisfied. And a big compliment to Amazon, delivery super fast, great!	1
As a renewal for my old iPhone 7th I am thrilled as with any new iPhone and here at Amazon even cheaper than Apple itself. Top	1
The data was transferred from iPhone 6 to XR via Bluetooth. Also, the I-watch was easy to connect. Device was cheaper on Amazon than Apple. Activation by face recognition is convenient. Have my Iphone also used for online identification via Postident.	1
Easy setup via previous iPhone and ICloud. I am very satisfied with quality, screen and performance.	1
The decision for the XR was not difficult for me after many reviews of journals and users. A good and expensive phone, but worth it for me.	1
I am super satisfied with this device. A nice big screen, great pictures even at dusk, an unlock that works immediately and reliably (up and unlocked) and really great selfies.	1
Apple typical, clean processing. Great display, despite lower resolution than the Xs. But this is so irrelevant in everyday use ... Simply a top device, thanks to Amazon with a small discount to the Apple Store.	1
A top smartphone, unfortunately, Apple is not for me (Face id is too complicated for me). Shipping was very fast and return processing as well.	1
Delivery was very fast and the product is just good	1
The fastest processor on the market, a camera that can shoot 4K in 60 fps and take super sharp photos. Quality, price / performance is currently the best in the market	1
Everything is wonderful!	1
Top as always, we have been using Apple for a long time and have never been disappointed. Just great.	1
Successor to the iPhone 5s. (For me) The XR is awesome. Fast, easy to use, battery 2 days loose ect ...	1
Everything was super packed arrived gladly again	1
The device is very fast, the operation well only the display could be better	1
It was the best gift for my friend	1
iPhone just super product	1
Perfect!	1
Top cell phone, top price, delivery as always TOP. Highly recommended	1
As described	1
Runs well for weeks.	1
fast delivery despite holiday. Price performance ratio ok	1
Everything great!	1
Have the smartphone for several weeks in operation. Actually, I like it quite well, but I have to harvest a lot of mockery and malice for it. Many colleagues and friends laugh at me about the device and ask if I have no money for a real iPhone? To be honest, it looks stupid if all their expensive and high-quality iPhone Xs or Xs max put on the table and I have to put my cheap phone next to it, usually I keep it in the bag so that no one sees it, of course it is stupid if it is but rings and everyone sees that I have only the cheap part. So my tip: put the part on vibration! Then you can with each call to weigh if you get it out and give you the nakedness, or not. I'm actually fully satisfied, the display is great, the working speed is a dream, the design is just great and it makes great photos. If it had simply made Apple 400-500 euros more expensive, then I would not have these problems with it. When renewing the contract I was also not clear that I do not get the expensive flagship, I have the Telekk chalk! You just had to tell me that it is the cheap device. So my tip: think twice if you can live with the pressure of society, if you get such a cheap device!	1
I decided to switch from the iPhone 8 to the XR. The following reasons: - bigger display - better battery-FaceID (I think it's great and always works somehow!) - gesture control Subject: iOS is still running smoothly, which is one of the reasons why I use Apple. It's a round system that works and is easy to use. Android is nothing for me after several attempts. Therefore, the price is justified, but everyone has to decide for themselves. My iPad Air from 2015 runs until today with much use absolutely smoothly. That does not create an Android ... is just so! The display is great, period. There will always be something that looks better on paper. My mother-in-law has a grade 9 and said yesterday that the display on my XR looks really great. So much for the delusion of YouTube experts. The display is bright and just as good as the iPhone 8's. And by the way ... all Tablets, whether iPad or Galaxy Tab etc, have a ppi of less than 300 ... and no one complains about it, quite the contrary! The battery is the absolute crucial point for me. Even with very intensive use, the battery lasts one and a half days. I do not need to say more about that. :-) Otherwise ... processing, telephone quality, network reception, quality of the photos ... as usual simply very good and completely sufficient! The gesture control goes into the blood after 5 minutes and you do not want anything else! (I also have it on my S9 + under Android 9 ... you can not compare with each other!) What I do not like so much: - the device is a bit unwieldy and heavier compared to the iPhone 8 - there is no original leather cover the notch takes some getting used to - Haptic touch is just not 3D touch, but you get used to it quickly - many or all users / creators always praise the black value of OLED panels ... I would not deny that. But no one mentions the white value ... that's a catastrophe in OLED's eyes and has much more weight than the black value. I do not know any OLED panel where the white balance is good. The LCD is really clean and knows how it should be. Therefore I emfinde a LCD like that of the iPhone XR, or 8, yes even that of the iPod always better than similar panels from Samsung, Huawei or the screen of the X / XS ... Objectively considered: - for the price, the display ( purely on paper) can tolerate a higher pixel density (Full HD) - 5.8 inches would have done it - generally the price (but where I always have to mention that everyone has to decide for themselves) Summa Summarum is the device perfect for me: not too big, not too small, great software and hardware, super camera, no stuttering, terrific battery, bright and clear display, update policy, security!	1
I switched from an iPhone X to XR. I'll keep it short: it's one of my absolute favorite iPhones. I'm not interested in the "numbers" on paper regarding resolution ect. Only decisive for me is the everyday test. For me, the XR makes better photos than any other iPhone I've ever had. The size is for me a sweet spot between the Plus and the Xer. Absolutely smooth operation and reaction in the Altag, stereo recording in videos, and simply the best value for money an iPhone in my view. (Although it is still "expensive" compared to other manufacturers). From me as a longtime iPhone owner a clear buy recommendation.	1
Had the 6'er for four years. Of course, the XR is superior to the 6'er in everything and not a step back. But it is also much bigger and heavier than the 6'er but also as the current X and XS.Habe quite big hands, but I can get used to it very quickly or my initial skepticism regarding size and weight in a timely manner. black border "" on the display does not bother me in the least, but I'm also in this regard. relatively relaxed or no peacock counter. But what makes me sick of the socks is the battery. I never expected that. Bsp.:Fr. 9h taken from the charging cable, used in my wake up the whole time with short Tel., Mails, I-Net, Whatts App, Youtube etc. plus 4h. 11h still 12% Akku.Es is something of unusual - but also relaxed, in the morning with only 50% battery out of the house to go and know that lasts for the whole day, if not enough until the next morning.	1
I bought the variant 128gb Product Red. However, not on Amazon, but 1day after publication in an electronics market. To my surprise, they had a lot of equipment on site, while a Mate 20 Pro was probably sold out fixed. Well, good. Current quality problems (display) when Mate show yes, the hype is not always good. Now for the XR.Yes I did not pre-order, because I wanted to watch the display live. This was however ratz fatz. I come from the iPhone 6 and feel the "restrictions" of the 326ppi as irrelevant. For comparison: My friend had an S7 Edge with 1440 pixels on the short side ... To save battery but she has chosen the setting 720p .... What strikes one from the iPhone 6 ... BATTERY. The battery life has felt doubled. Did I used to paddle on the couch with a tablet, I can now do it with the iPhone, without seeing the percentage tumble. SizeYes the XR is bigger and heavier (felt twice as heavy). But the transition from my mini Android phone to the iPhone 6 seemed to me more difficult. Meanwhile, the pockets of jeans are probably just bigger ... I got used to it very quickly. CameraIn good lighting conditions, the iPhone 6 has already taken good pictures. Since the quality of the images of the XR is already a corner better, but nothing that is why you have to change. In our apartment (a bit dark), however, the differences are very clear. While the iPhone 6 was just barely able to deliver something useful, the pictures of the XR are really great. Portrait Mode: Class. Although with errors, but is just calculated and no DSLR. Although I have no comparison to the XS, but I think I prefer the camera of the XR because of the much brighter lens with the portraits are shot. I justify my opinion with a comparison of the S9 plus, which makes portraits with a F2.4 lens and submits Murx in poorer lighting conditions. Therefore: I am fully satisfied ... the price would not be. I have already expected the nicely, since earlier the plus devices with Apple were even more expensive. An iPhone 7/8 was not out of the question, because I did not want to spend 500-600Eus for a phone that looks no different than my iPhone 6 and in everyday life so much more does not offer, as well as my iPhone 6 was still running ,	1
I had the last 2 years the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s in use and have due to the high price, the change to the XR longer considered, but now vollzogen.Kleich right away: YES the device is larger and - no na - also "" heavier "", but that does not bother me! After all, there are enough ways to gain a haptic impression before making a purchase. The display convinced me first in the branch of a large electric chain and now in operation at home and on the road. Of course it is not comparable to the big brother XS, but if you want a better display, you just have to buy the more expensive device. What I like very much are the following things: the cameras, the stereo sound (so you even The possibility of wireless charging and face ID as a logical successor to TouchID. All in all - for me, the device is an absolute gain and I find nothing for me to complain. And as I said: If I had wanted to buy an absolute high-end device, my choice would have been the XS. I can not do anything with the androids, alone because of the possibility of a COMPLETE backup without somehow having to fumble with the software of the device or the confusing settings in my opinion. This is also a matter of taste and I have no interest here any iOS. Android debates to kick off.	1
I did not buy the iPhone here. But I am very satisfied, very nice picture. + Nice colors + sound quality super + spoke quality + camera (best with the app Procamera) This makes the best photos. Would anyone recommend an iPhone.	1
So my wife is happy with it and think it's great handy made;) Super apple Apple once Apple	1
great mobile	1
Super is above all the durability of the Akku, clear improvement to the iPhone 7 picture quality top	1
Apple keeps what the description promises. Simply great technology. Very good camera allows perfect pictures.	1
I like it	1
No other mobile phone, fully convinced	1
Absolute top device Had an IphoneSE before and the XR is totally sufficient for my applications. Can not understand some recessions. Would buy it again immediately	1
Perfect	1
Very good smartphone. Unfortunately, I really miss the homebutton, because I often do not lock my phone makes it fax and pants.	1
Top product, top price, super fast shipping	1
I am very happy to have saved about 140 euros on Amazon. At first, I thought of fraud because the phones were so cheap. But I can give the all-clear: These are original iPhones. All good! Gladly again!	1
Installation of IPhone old on new easy and problem-free	1
Great phone with a good display size. Storage capacity is very good. Battery life is better than other iPhones but still can drain quickly under heavy data loads such as navigation.	1
Hello ! The new iphone is my opinion very well. Quality of materials and system is better than competitors. Only thing I do not like is that the battery does not show percentage consumption at main display you have to pull from top to bottom with your finger then shows percentage consumption. Regards Slawek	1
If I disregard the circumstances with the payment and the resulting delivery delay by Amazon, I am so far very satisfied with the iPhone X. I have the iPhone now about 4 weeks. The data could easily be installed on the new mobile phone via the cloud. After about 2-3 hours, I had everything set up so far on the new iPhone X. It was the first time I set up an iPhone through the cloud.	1
I have been using it since May 2018 and I am still very satisfied. During this time, I was also able to test a Galaxy s9 + and a Huawei Mate 20 pro, so I had the direct comparison to the Android cars. The iPhone X is still running very smoothly and the operating system is a dream, especially unlike Huawei. So far I have no scratches, etc. and always used the original Apple leather case. What I like best is the form factor, relatively small device with a large display. I have decided to continue to use the iPhone X because the overall package is unbeatable. Face recognition still works perfectly. Now for the small drawback: The camera could make better photos in this price range, especially in bad light. Since has the Huawei Mate 20 pro clearly ahead, but only there.	1
Brand new Iphone, original packed, and at a great price! A-Mountain is recommended as a seller.	1
When I read all the negative reviews I was skeptical. For me at least everything went well: fast delivery, the device (an iPhone X) was new, welded, had NO scratches or other malfunctions. OK, the price is already a house number ...... Apple just!	1
As always with Amazon lightning delivery. The device was sold and delivered directly by Amazon. More on this below. It was as expected in an original VP, which was without damage and sealed. The phone itself was also fully equipped with all papers. There were absolutely NO traces on the phone, which is to be expected from Apple. I had to choose between the Xr and the X. After examining both, it became the X. Why? The screen with the much higher resolution and the OLED itself were the main reasons, plus the smaller form factor and the more elegant frame. The X is like the Xs only slightly underpowered, which any normal Benzutzer but will never notice. Thus one gets an Xs for the price of the X. Good Deal. There is no need to talk about the further advantages of the X. Attention: There are some windy companies in the market who sell remanufactured, or already returned or so-called showcase models, which often have an apparently new packaging "" Originally Welded "". Please note that these are not new devices in the true sense, but apparently new ones, which usually always have to be declared as such. The companies that label their goods as treated or refurbished are reputable and do not leave behind the impression, like the black sheep, that Amazon or Apple may be selling equipment that itself has small defects. Amazon always sells original goods that come directly from the manufacturer. Therefore, the note to future buyers of Apple. If you buy through Amazon, you only opt for devices that are sold and shipped by Amazon to make sure you receive 100% goods. Do not be tempted by supposedly great prizes. The trouble when the money is gone and the device has quirks, not worth it, just to save a few euros. And finally, a note to the Hater comments. My God, folks, are you really so frustrated that you can not scrape together the coal for a really good product, and go to the level of washerwomen?	1
For me, my smartphone is the most important everyday companion, which is why I think it's okay to spend just over 900 €. The iPhone X is perfect for performance and comfort. I like the camera in portrait mode, which mimics an SLR camera. Of the photos are many really excited. Sure, there are cheaper phones and not for everyone it makes sense to spend so much money for it. But who wants to have an iPhone, is very well served with this. Before, I had an iPhone 6. For the iPhone XS, I see no significant difference, which is why I have decided for the X. The device I have now for 8 months and it still gives me a great feeling. Incidentally, face recognition also works very well in the dark. : D	1
The OLED display is really great. Otherwise, of course, super workmanship, quality design, Apple typical just.	1
Switch from iPhone 6 to iPhone X. Do not regret the high purchase price, I am very satisfied with image quality and operation.	1
I was Samsung user for years, my last Apple device was many years back (iPod touch 2nd generation). So I was with the operation and handling of the iPhone in Neuland.Der shipping was great, everyone is only recommended no preference which smartphones ONLY FROM AMAZON TO BUY (sold and sent by Amazon) to exclude any fraud or the like. To transfer my data from the Samsung Galaxy S8 to the iPhone X I wanted to use the app 'move to iOS', unfortunately, my wireless connection broke but always only EXACTLY THEN off, when I entered the code to transfer the data. Thus, all contacts etc. had to be entered manually, which was at first relatively frustrating, but in retrospect only a small problem. All in all, the change to iOS was one Lightness, the operating system is very user friendly, new and old functions can be explained in the 'Tips' section. The history recognition runs flawlessly, remains flawless even in the dark. The camera shoots 1A photos, resolution and display are top.Other small features such as Facetime or the general better customization of apps on iOS embellish the experience. Finally, the iPhone X shines with a sophisticated design, however, a shell is recommended because with Glass jacketed smartphone otherwise quickly loses the visual touch.	1
Purchased directly from Amazon. Packaging was unopened, the iPhone accordingly brand new. It is a very good device. Makes excellent pictures. The battery lasts about 1.5 days with an average of 4.5 hours screen on time. Will probably still receive several years of updates and in performance it also brings with it more than enough resources. As long as it does not fall down, it should not be a problem for the next 3-4 years.	1
After I flew my X after the break on the motorway rest area in the on-the-highway driving from the roof (I assume that within a few minutes at least twenty 40-tonner drove over it ...) I have despite some bad reviews ordered a new X. What should I say, delivery time as specified and unpacked. New SIM card inserted, within minutes of the cloud everything up to "" short-before-loss "" condition updated and until the financial penalty for own stupidity has been like everything since before! I hope not, but if so, then again. , ,	1
I have always had a Samsung and have now switched to the iPhone X, as Samsung was getting worse. The phone is just great! Super fast and very good battery!	1
Next Generation iPhone. Once you get used to the gestures that are explained very well when you get started, you do not want to miss them anymore. The HomeButton I have missed at any time. To battery / image / operating system, I can only say: iPhone just does what it should and kann.Die apps have now synonymous to 99% of the Notch adjusted.	1
I think the iPhone S is outstanding. The size is still justifiable, unlike the XR and the face recognition works perfectly. The battery life is on my phone lonely tip - recharge every 2-3 days with normal use. The resolution of the camera including sound is quite impressive. Given the fact that it is also cheaper than the XS and XR only recommend it.	1
Am thrilled. Powerful and fluid controls. For 854 € bought here on Amazon. Clearly the best iPhone so far. What impresses me most is the outstanding battery life. I'm not exaggerating! I watched 2 movies with 27% battery! Each ~ 2 hours.	1
Everything worked out great. The phone arrived one day later after ordering. Original packaging and the phone completely new. Therefore, 5 stars for the service initiated via Amazon. The phone is, I think, also first class.	1
I really wanted an original iPhone X and can not understand the comments that this is a fake. Mine was sent unopened in original Apple packaging, including headphones and charging cable. I'm super satisfied and everything works fine :)	1
Not my first Apple smartphone, so no big miracle for me, but the smartphone is good enough to treat yourself :)	1
Shipping took over 1 week, but everything else ok	1
Did very well, the iphone came very fast. Was original and packed. Everything works great. And that for the cheap price. Thank you	1
Normally the face recognition works quite well. Only occasionally there are problems. Let's hope for the future generations.	1

The product is top class, I am very happy with it.	1
Inexpensive than in the specialized trade only to be recommended	1
1 day Apple warranty, but what are you. No scratch. Battery condition 95%	1
Top device. Even if one pays for an "old" iPhone significantly more than the same old competing products, it is worthwhile to get a tuned device with an intuitive and secure OS. Differences to the new generation will not be noticed in everyday use at all.	1
No homebutton, but quickly settled in, now I have "difficulties" with devices with Homebutton	1
delivered quickly, delivered as described.	1
Super mobile, brilliant camera! Is worth the price!	1
I am very satisfied, it is great to use and loading without wires is also a huge advantage.	1

Everything fits ... Problem is you have no insurance, i. E. If something breaks you have to pay it yourself ..	1
The device was delivered within 3 days, in the original packaging. It was welded and unused. I am very happy with the purchase and can only recommend the iPhone X!	1
Everything I need for comm, photo/video with elegance and high quality. Glad it is the X and not the newer models.	1

Very good iPhone. Sure, there are better phones or cheaper, but they just do not work with IOS. Very happy with the iPhone, as well as with the delivery!	1
After almost a year, I can say a lot about the revolutionary iPhone X. First, the negative: 1. Price: Without Zeifel the device was initially very expensive. Nevertheless, I have decided to do so, because I use my phone much more frequently than, for example, a laptop. The latter was much cheaper to buy for it.2. Fear of breakage and high costs: As recommended, I have wrapped my iPhone and provided with a glass sheet. Minor falls tolerated the device already. A short fright was nevertheless there regularly. However, I still assume that if the device falls from a certain height, the repair costs could be well over half of the purchase price. That would be a disaster! So far, everything is fine! 3. Waterproof: This property I challenged in the last vacation. For videos and photos below the water surface in the pool. Partly deeper than 1 m. Everything went fine the first time. Last time I was under water for a bit longer and maybe even deeper. After this fun, the speaker did not work properly anymore. Only with the download of an app that generates a sound in a certain frequency, the speaker recovered. The device works again without problems. Here, too, the shock was deep. Portrait pictures: Depending on the incidence of light, the portrait function may partly lead to deformations of the persons depicted in the photos. Basically, the photos are very nice, but the portraits work only with the right lighting conditions. Now the positives: 1. Bindschirm The picture quality is very good. I also quickly got used to the format. The recess for the camera and face recognition is no obstacle for me! The design: Perfectly processed and optically a trendsetter. You could see competitors stepping on this bandwagon. You can tell, Apple has always been a small step ahead.3. Camera: Photos, even under difficult conditions, succeed perfectly! The possibilities are also really practical and contemporary. Actually, almost like a photographer, you can quickly take great pictures of yourself. Even under difficult conditions, it works great! The possibilities are also really practical and contemporary. Videos are also good. Also the sound recording. For me, an additional camera with this device has become completely unnecessary.4. PerformanceThe performance is enormous. You can use AirPlay to transfer eg GoogleEarth on the TV and to rotate and zoom the world smoothly.5. FaceID works very well in most cases. Even with dirty hands eg when cooking is in my opinion the better technique compared to the fingerprint. Operation / comfortAlso here the user has the regular feeling that a premium smartphone to use. For small hands, the size of the screen might be a bit more cumbersome.Other / Conclusion: As neutral, I would consider the battery life. You come through the day. All in all, I can say that the device is very expensive and there are certain risks, such as the break down, but the comfort and technical possibilities are very good and jumpy progressive. The quality is very high quality, photos and videos succeed well and you can see a lot on the big screen what you want to see - the edge is almost gone. Who uses the smartphone extensively and the features are important, has everything you need - if also for a proud price. Purchase recommendation: Yes!	1
The phone is pretty thin and the operation explains itself a lot of (Samsung would have previously). The delivery was very fast and everything was packed very well	1
A very great iPhone especially the pictures are very nice	1
Great, thank you	1
Super fast delivery, the device is great, gladly again.	1
Very good product. Can only recommend further.	1
Not the first smartphone I ordered on Amazon. I'm once again excited about the iPhone quality! Everything perfect! I do not use facial recognition, so I can not rate it	1
As a fan difficult to criticize	1
Everything went very fast. Very good device. However, Apple has now removed the iPhone X from its store because the XR, XS and XS Max are coming. The prices for an X should therefore loose below 700, - fall from the 21.09 when the new models come, everything else does not pay off, since a XR 849, - costs and is equipped with the latest features. Everything else the display, this is LCD, what you do not mind. So dear providers, goes with the times, down with the price	1
Got today my IPhone X and could test it extensively .... Granted I was a bit skeptical because of the missing Home Button! But long story short. It is the best IPhone that I ever had! Just great, good IOS was I already known, but now the screen over the entire screen and the handling just great .... Thanks to Apple even if the price is grossly overdrawn, but the loss of value is not as big as Android and by a contract extension will be synonymous payable.	1
So everything runs perfect and I have only a trace of use obwogl the Iphone X is used but all top	1
After many years of use of Windows phones, it was initially reluctantly back to Android, after the Windows devices have unfortunately done in the market. A good phone of the main competitor of Apple made initially a lot of joy. After about a year, however, there were more problems with the top model of the previous year and the phone hung on a regular basis. Before the usual rapid decline in the price of Android devices, this was also in the price range of an iPhone. I've been using the iPhone X for several months now and it's going fantastic like the first day. In addition comes the long-term update care of Apple, which in principle promises a much longer full use compared to Android. I've struggled a bit longer to buy an iPhone because of the price. But I think not least of the previous use, that the certain extra charge for corresponding top smartphones from Android pays off (at least if you do not need the latest model for each model change). A smartphone with great feel and features. All in all, definitely five stars.	1
Everything good. Arrived one day earlier.	1
Great phone!	1
I am an Apple and iOS fan .... who accepts the tastes are different with the iPhone X 256 GB in itself, I am absolutely satisfied Ok the price is just like he is unfortunately .. Now for shipping .... this has taken 2 1/2 weeks .... which is basically ok, but it is really bad if you are happy as a small child at Christmas .... no fun .... was to represent .... Packed it was safe .... there were zero problems with the seller	1
I'm not about to apply iPhone as a showpiece dick. I want a smartphone that (1.) both hardware and software is stable (2.) fast (3.) looks good (4.) makes good photos, videos, etc. It may be that Apple products in the price-performance ratio by far more expensive than the competition. But if one considers that the resale value is also correspondingly high, the argument "too expensive" is unnecessary in my view. Compared to predecessor models (up to i7) are in each of the above. Points partly significant increases to recognize. In addition, the super oled display and the very successful face recognition. Therefore from me clear purchase recommendation. The only thing you have to get used to is that before you know what key combination for "off" is provided, first make some unwanted screenshots and the not to be missed, missing home button.	1
I can highly recommend iPhone X, battery running time with normal use about 2 days! top camera, lies very well with cover in hand; I would buy it again right away!	1
The iPhone X is the new star in the iPhone universe: For the first time since the iPhone 6, there is a new design. The new high-contrast XXL screen covers almost the entire front and is THE highlight of the X. The innovative face recognition works well and faster after some habituation than the iris scan of the competition. The processor is as turbo-fast as the iPhone 8, the tele zoom of the second camera lens hardly noticeably improved. The biggest disappointment: The battery does not even make ten hours of intensive use, as is especially the 8 Plus more enduring.	1
Mega horny IPhone.Can I recommend to anyone. Super Camera	1
Who a "plus" is too much ... I can absolutely recommend the X. The form factor is perfect on a larger display, in my opinion. It is great in the hand. However, a shell is a must because it is very smooth and can slip easily out of hand. The operation of the iOS without the home button is slightly different, but quickly internalized. The price is without a doubt steep and everyone should decide for themselves. If & shipping through the dealer was perfect.	1
Has already been said enough! Price is steep, but the device is nice :)) Yes, yes, I know, this is a typical "" women's commentary "";)	1
Great phone. I can only recommend. Very good menu navigation and handling. Take very nice photos, it's fun to take pictures with this phone.	1
The iPhone X is a top device! I am very pleased. A must have. Also the whole transaction was very good.	1
The iPhone is original sealed and brand new. Super fast delivery! Everything perfect!	1
Delivery very fast Friday ordered Saturday shipping and Monday in the hands =) I switched from iPhone 6s to X great upgrade who has an iphone 7 does not necessarily have to buy a newer device.	1
Screen from top to bottom, mini edge, top workmanship and very chic. Lies wonderful in the hand and the gestures to steer you out quickly. I'm currently on 2 days of battery runtime, have it at night and at work in flight mode (except the 1 hour break) Am synonymous no Poweruser more, since I last had a 3 years old iPhone which was really not to use except to charge the battery ^ ^ Sure expensive, normally you would have to deduct a star because price performance is catastrophic compared to other manufacturers ... But for such an innovative mege hot product you can schonmal raushauen all 5 stars.Face ID works so incredibly well, in any Lichtverhältniss, almost scary.I'm really happy with that.	1
top cell phone, I can only recommend! but in a good contract! Because € 900 in one blow for a mobile phone, I think a bit steep.	1
As always, I'm super happy with the iPhone, only facial recognition does not always work perfectly and paint on the bottom is already on.	1
I ordered this device for my girlfriend, because she liked my Iphone X and she is as excited as I am, processing, optics and software as usual from apple TOP.	1
The conclusion in advance: For me, the best overall package, which exists on the market. Professional camera with great results looking the same. Great sound experience with music & phone calls. Sufficient battery capacity for two days. Design-technically appealing and a stable construction complete the package. The only downside is the Preis.Bericht: Since the iPhone 4, I've had pretty much every iPhone. Later came a MacBook, an iPad and now an Apple Watch and HomePod. Compatibility and functionality are second to none. The integrity of the software as well. I have always changed. The longest I had the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 / G7.Android could not convince me on several levels. Why IOS and iPhone: 1. CompatibilityI synced all photos on the Mac and with my devices. Easy to handle and, above all, safe. The iPhone X in portrait mode lets the layman think a professional camera would have been at work. Simply great. The X replaces my digital camera to 100% and the results can be seen. Also video recordings are absolutely great. What is particularly convincing is lifelike recording. It just looks like real. Not oversaturated, no brighter colors usw..Auch after years, I even like the pictures of the iPhone 5.2. From the sound could only keep up with the G7, where the differences but in some songs within some songs seemed too artificial. With Apple music, the overall package works much better. The player is also simple but functional. Playlists are quickly created and accessible from any of my devices. As an advocate of discrete data, I was not initially a friend of Cloud and the like. However, those who are concerned with the topic know that IOS is safer than Android and even tampering with the authorities. For the money, I trust Apple.3. Device clean, stable and best handling despite display size. Thanks to Apple that there are still handy devices. I do not know why the delusion of size and at the same time a tablet to do so. In sports, with children, at work or on the road, the input operation is fundamental. Not only for the quick snapshot, but also for telephone or music control is so much better. The quality is excellent. No button wobbles. After almost a year, only the Alurahmwn is scratched. However, a protective cover was rarely worn.4. ConnectionsMakes everything clean and without problems. I am often surprised how the system keeps all the components apart and still works cleanly. Conclusion: Recommended to anyone who attaches great importance to photos, music and telephony.	1
I switched from the SE to the X. Display is really great, very bright and top of the colors. I have turned off True Tone, because the colors are otherwise too reddish. For me personally important point is the camera: In low light conditions are worlds between the two cameras. In bright daylight, the SE has already delivered good pictures, here is the improvement not soooo clearly visible. Super is also the 10x zoom. The changeover (no homebutton, Face ID) is not really an act. I got used to it very quickly. I am (so far) very satisfied with the smartphone. The only criticism is the high price.	1
I'm probably not the default user. For me, the iPhone is 100% a working tool. Professionally, I have put together a workable system for the job. Macbook Air, Mac Mini, Airport Extreme and the 3 GB Time Capsule. The smartphone is just a part of it. I started with the iPhone 3, then iPhone 4s, iPhone 5s and finally 6s. I did not hold on to the latter until the end. So far, I thought it was not better. But I'll tell you - it goes. Some advantages of the iPhone X briefly noted: - Camera - super, just the new portrait mode I use for taking pictures of technical details, - nice big screen, - Face ID - class and even works diagonally on the Dashboard in the vehicle, - speed in the apps - noticeably faster, and, and, and .... The back is unfortunately very slippery through the glass. Since I always use a transparent silicone case for the iPhone's, this small problem is also solved. So does not bother the sublime design of the camera on the back absolutely nicht.Die so-called "" notch "" is actually gone from day two. The fanfare in the media around this thing can be forgotten. It is really only someone who looks up for the first time. A bit I miss but the percentage of state of charge rechts.Also above all, to be recommended.	1
Have the cell phone before Christmas still on time. Mobile phone arrived in orginal packaging! Top quality! Apple typical!	1
The shipping and selling of A-Montain was smooth. In the beginning, I was a bit skeptical as to whether this phone is for me (especially at the price) but I have to say it's worth the money. I love the camera, the battery life (compared to my old Iphone 6s) and the design. The display is superior in comparison to the Iphone 6s, also the processor speed. FaceID works a lot better, even in the dark, as I imagined , Of course, one can now argue about whether it really is worth so much money. However, my experience shows that I have the Apple devices just longer in my possession, because they are not immature after a year and still work well.So I am completely satisfied and do not regret the purchase!	1
As fast as ever. I came from the latest Samsung. I love how fast it is and how good the camera is. Use it a lot, battery could still be better.	1
I bought the iPhone only very hesitant, because I was afraid that it is not processed high quality, because it was just under 150 ¬ cheaper than Apple directly. Finally, I decided to do it and do not regret it to this day. So far no problems with the iPhone had. I can only recommend it to buy.	1
First of all: I did not buy the iPhone X via Amazon but rather via an electronic market that was not mentioned by name. I had previously an iPhone SE and I was always very satisfied with it. The IPhone X, I have now been in use for a good two weeks and would like to dwell on some points.-) Design-) Display-) Face ID-) Camera) Battery -) Voice quality (that's first and foremost a telephone) Design: The look of the iPhone Ten is great. It is great in the hand and just feels extremely valuable. Everything is rock solid and nothing wobbles or creaks. The size is just so suitable for your one-handed operation. (Although I have big hands) But from time to time you have to embrace. I had the iPhone SE before and thought that was the perfect smartphone size. When I look at the old part now, it seems almost tiny. ;) About the purchase of a case you should think, because the phone is very slippery by the two glass sides and tends to glass breakage in a fall.Display: The display is great and very sharp. The OLED panel comes from Samsung, but was calibrated by Apple. Colors are not too gaudy, white and black are in a nutshell. The "True Tone" (the colors are shown warmer) feature is very useful and protects the eyes. If you tilt the iPhone to the side, the display quickly gets a blue cast, which I do not feel annoying. The much scolded notch at the top of the display, the "notch" I do not feel annoying. Face ID Touch ID never used, so I can not say much. The new technique: Face ID works very reliable in 98% of cases. Sometimes it hooks up and you have to unlock Manuel by code entry. For example, if the phone is on the table or shortly after getting up;) All in all, Face ID but a successful innovation! Camera: The camera I have so far used little, but what I have found so far is brutally good and makes endless have fun. Extremely sharp and detailed images, even in bad light. The portrait mode is still in its infancy (officially beta) and the filters are not always right.Sometimes too much is cut, sometimes a border stops. But yes-beta. The camera shoots 4K video at 60 fps and 1080p video at 240 fps, eliminating the need for a compact camera. You do not have to understand Apple's decision to let the camera lenses feel 2 meters out of the case, which means that the iPhone X on a table could function loosely as a rocker ... With an optional but recommendable case that can be easily remedied.Battery : The battery of the iPhone X is sufficiently dimensioned and you can easily get it over the day. Even 1.5 - 2 days are possible with little use. Nice is that the iPhone X finally supports wireless charging via Qi standard. But I have not tried it yet. Charging, and for me that is the only real criticism of the iPhone X, takes almost 4h !!! (Unfortunately, Apple lays down only a standard 5W power supply, which is a pity at the price! Voice quality: The IPhone X is a great digital camera, a great camcorder, a reliable sat nav, etc. In short, a great companion in everyday life That's why I want to rate the voice quality separately.The voice quality is very good and clear.The background noise is filtered out and suppressed.And my interlocutors have always understood me clearly.Feeling the best voice quality I ever had with a phone Conclusion: The iPhone X is a great device and for me the best Iphone ever - a worthy anniversary Iphone! I would not miss it anymore. I would rate it with 4.7 stars because I find it annoying the Apple itself Almost 4 hours to recharge with the standard power supply, I feel as too long, but since I can not give 4.7 stars and I am 4 stars for such a great device too little, I give 5 stars! Whether you're ready to spend so much money on a smartphone, everyone has to decide for themselves! I regret nothing!!! ;)	1
Everything was fine already came earlier than the 16.4 the phone is also technology as visually synonymous really good	1
What should I say great about the product, I think it should be self-evident. PERFECT!!! Well-known Apple quality. In mobile phones or laptops or TVs, etc., one decides at some point for a manufacturer. The decision of which manufacturer likes one better or not always lies in the eye of the user. Although Apple pays a lot of money ... for the products, but gets a very good product with a better service I think in the background, which then justifies the price somewhere again. It does not always have to be the latest technology you have, it has to work. And that's what Apple has achieved with this product again. It can be operated like all other iOS devices previously, ie. the "" conversion "" was not present. If the device is configured correctly, then you have a battery life of about 2 - 3 days (at the beginning, of course not, because you have to test everything extensively, for example, Animoji ;-P). From my side, top product, which you have to afford first, but if you can be very satisfied.	1
For the first time an iPhone, where everything is great.	1
The shipping date was as promised	1
Although I bought the phone somewhere else, but still wants to share my experience with it. I'm completely thrilled. For me, the best iPhone I've ever had. (Am years of iPhone users). The graphics are great and I like the new features. The Notch personally bothers me not at all. Whether the price is justified, everyone must decide for themselves. It is worth it.	1
The device is amazing. Very high quality processed. I find the gesture control particularly successful, I do not miss the home button anymore. The display is crisp sharp. The size is just great. Hope the next IPad also comes with a borderless design and gesture control.	1
TopDelivery was fast packaging was quite ok, I found it useful but not throwing sure (you never know how the suppliers throw around it) Smartphone is running super apple just	1
Sold by A-Montain. Shipping via Amazon. The article is in original packaging and new. I'm very satisfied. The portait function is also very good.	1
A really fine part ... well thought out and really fast ... great camera ... the new control without homebutton goes quickly into flesh and blood.	1
I have 3 months now this phone is great !!!	1
It is and remains the best smartphone on the market. Simply unrivaled in handling and operation and I already had some. Very fast and flawless delivery. Also, the creation of a commercial bill worked great. Great supplier, always happy.	1
We hold the device since Friday in the hands and give here first impressions again, which may be supplemented later. But first: It is as safe as the amen in the church, that in a new iPhone presentation, the critics come out of their holes , Sometimes the technology is not innovative enough, sometimes it is complained that the new features have been copied and are now installed in other devices. This year is massively working off the price that Apple calls for its new flagship and in advance: yes, 1,319 euros for a smartphone are a damn lot of money. Apart from the fact that even this price is always a subjective benchmark, which can vary depending on the usage behavior of each purchase, the hidden behind it criticism of the affluent society is meant nicely, but often enough rather hypocritical therefore. Why the guilty conscience just supposed to be present on iPhone users, but not on Samsung TV peepholes or Jack Wolfskin jacket straps, nobody could tell us conclusively until today. Fair trade is all that is not and is produced as good as always inexpensive in third countries. But back to the price: Smartphones nowadays function as useful helpers in everyday life. For 1.319 euros, the buyer of the iPhone X gets a phone (surprise!), A camera, which makes now portrait pictures, the SLR level reached (of course, not in the same resolution), a camcorder that records in 60FPS in 4K, a Navigation device, a calendar, a voice recorder ... what we want to say: a smartphone unites in itself meanwhile quite a lot of devices. And that the competition at the same level does not sell for half, has hopefully meanwhile rumgesprochen.Sei it. The discussion Apple vs everyone else will continue. A strange ritual. But even people who get an iPhone as a status symbol (which is silly, since status symbols are more likely to be found in the watch / car / yacht segment) do that out of their very own drive and ultimately it is not up to anyone to judge The incredibly compact design of the iPhone X makes it just a few millimeters larger than an iPhone 8, but due to the rimlessness it has a bigger screen than the Plus model. Thus, the approximately 36 grams lighter (compared to our predecessor phone 6s Plus) cell phone just wonderfully in the hand. Due to the glass surface on the back of a case, however, is highly recommended, especially since the repair should also be extremely expensive. With a case or an enclosing case but also the problem of the protruding camera solved. The display itself, Apple has not promised too much, as one bragged with naked values: it is crisp, has bright colors and the fonts see on the " Super Retina "really like carved. If you scroll over some web pages, a minimal (!) Nachschlieren the font falls on.No idea if you get the software under control, it does not bother. The notch and the rounded corners also do not bother, on the contrary. You look great on apps designed for that, when almost the entire screen is filled. With not yet optimized apps, however, something is missing directly, but most developers pull it quickly (Huhu, Spotify) .- The camera in video mode is stored as a standard HD with 30 FPS, which can be changed in the settings, but should. There were a few jerks at 30 FPS for moving people in daylight. At 60 FPS in HD that is no longer noticeable and at 4K, the image is then outstanding. Disadvantage: 1 minute 4K equals 400 MB. Otherwise, we've experimented a lot with the portrait mode, which puts people (and objects) in focus and blurs the background. Looks great and fun. For users like us, who did not know that from the 6s, almost a reason to buy. Also normal photos look great, but as I said: the portrait mode is just the most fun (see pictures attached) .- Face-ID and the new gestures: here we were the most skeptical. Over the course of time, the homebutton has finally become dear to the heart, the fingerprint has been recognized quickly. How should Face ID come along? Answer: pretty fantastic. Setting up was fast, unlocking the screen is very fast and intuitive (you do not think you have to stare at your smartphone to unlock it). Even in completely dark rooms Face-ID works perfectly. The new wiping gestures are so internalized after a day that one thinks one would never have used the iPhone otherwise.- The software: here we only have to say that apps or websites are loaded with an impressive speed. In addition to the usability of iPhones you fly through the Telefon.Wir we can after this first weekend no major criticisms (except for the subtle streak while scrolling). Apple has managed a great iPhone and adopted the design of its predecessor. We really enjoyed it. And yes with the Animojis (which you can also save in the Fotoapp and then send via WhatsApp). Thank you for reading.	1
The iPhone X is already different from its predecessors. Of particular note is of course the almost borderless display with the characteristic recess on the upper edge of the display, where the camera and sensors for the Face ID are housed. At the same time, Apple's typical home button is missing. But the display extends almost to the lower edge of the case. The side edges are about as wide as the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Although the display is not completely borderless, as it is known from Samsung's Galaxy S8. Apple uses the iPhone X for the first time an OLED display. It is sharp and bright enough, but when compared with the LCDs of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, it is noticeable that it looks noticeably darker at the highest brightness level than the conventional iPhone displays. In portrait mode, the two tabs on the right and left of the front camera are mostly used used to display time, wireless connections and battery level, backed by the background color of the respective app. Even with apps that use the entire display in landscape mode, the "notch" has not attracted attention so far. More conspicuous is that many apps in landscape mode (still) do not even use the entire display of the iPhone X. Instead, black bars are displayed on the right and left. When using the iPhone X, Apple users have to get used to it. The home button as a central control falls away. But as big as initially feared the change is not. Instead of pressing the home button to return to the start page, you now wipe the bottom of the display. The message center can be reached at the same place as before by wiping in the middle from top to bottom. Only the control center has found a new home. You have to swipe from the top right into the display. The only handle that may need some practice is the app changer. To open it, you have to swipe up, hold on the screen and release. If you continue wiping at the wrong moment, you end up back on the homescreen. But after a few attempts you have the hang of it here. The iPhone X has a lot of new features, most notably the almost borderless 5.8-inch display, which packs Apple in a just handy case. The margins leave a little margin, it would be even borderless. The change, which brings the missing home button with it, does not turn out as serious as feared. Above all, the unlocking by Face ID is really fast. The iPhone X makes a good first impression in any case. Apple delivers a high-quality smartphone, which in spite of the many changes is ultimately a typical iPhone, but for which one must also really dig deep into the bag. Look also on my blog: isartest enIf you think my rating is good, I would happy about a "" helpful "".	1
Have changed from the iPhone 6 to X because I needed more memory and wanted a larger display. The iPhone X is the right phone if you need performance. It is compact and the new display can be operated very well. FaceID Works top.	1
After 4 years and nurturing and maintaining my iphone 6 I switched to the Iphone X. The height price is worth it to me because I can not handle Android phones. As usual, easy move and set up. The features convince.	1
Apple has done a great job again! Face ID is a force, the new gesture control without homebutton as intuitive as if you had never used anything else. All apps back in place, okay, check some passwords and settings, but that's peanuts! I switched from the iPhone 6 and it's worth it!	1
I bought the Xer in the Apple Store. In addition a leather case and a protective foil via Amazon. Although the iPhone has crashed a few times from about 1m, it still has no damage. So if you are careful, the fragility is kept within limits or no longer a problem. When I first set up the iPhone, I found it incredibly ugly and especially the silver stainless steel frame looked very cheap for me. I got used to it quickly and now I think it's the most beautiful iPhone. For me an absolute plus is Face ID. The iPhone opens the preview of the news on eye contact. Never again enter any passwords at the App Store or online banking. No back and forth on the fingerprint sensor.	1
I have now bought the iPhone X. Ahead of time said that I had an iPhone 7Plus and an iPhone 8 Plus before. And I have to say really - WOW! This is the first iPhone, where the price is really justified. Everyone else always say that the Notch should be disturbing, but I just think the Notch damn "sexy". Performance and design are really great together. Real class Habdy and 1000% recommended	1
Hello everybody, I share my experiences with this iphone. I had previously Iphone 7 Plus. - Home Button missing I found this "" Button "" really good Fingerprint was detected to 99%. Central point to control the device which I miss personally. Minus gets the X here because FaceID takes much longer than TouchId and the gesture control is not as robust as the Home Button. But now the big improvements: + image is slightly larger than / Plus, OLED shows for me the best picture ever. + Camera, pictures are very good Feels even better than on the 7 Plus, but also represented by the better display contrast. Small criticism in both devices is the format of the photos. That should fill out the HandyDisplay. It does not do it. Is probably small picture format. ++ I can now call and surf at the same time. Who could afford it and Apple lovers, should definitely buy the X. + BatteryWas I noticed that the battery, although similar in size as 7Plus holds much longer , Despite heavy use I come to more than 2 days, if need be, probably even 3 days. For older iPhones, especially the Mobile Hotspot emptied the battery (my 4S was even sucked out in the long run, although connected to power, even the 7 Plus had there still problems), since Apple seems to have improved a lot on the energy management.	1
I would like to write a review here, since I follow this iPhone since the first rumors. The phone lies perfectly in his hand with its stainless steel frame. I am absolutely excited and definitely want it. Unfortunately, it is not my own ^ ^ The sound is clear, no matter if I hear music or call with handsfree. The display is incredibly bright and very colorful. OLED sends greetings! I'm just thrilled and on the other hand, my 8 Plus is very dull:) But now to the "notch problem" which in my opinion is not one. The display is just as big across the image width as the 8 Plus. Then only the rest comes next to the notch. So overall the display is even wider across !!! So no restriction! How to use it later is reserved for the programmers. Edging up is narrower than an 8 Plus, but it is also much better in the hand, in addition to the really handy frame. This is no longer so slippery and the phone is hanging well in the hand. The battery is very strong and holds in my opinion longer than the 8 Plus. But that will bring the next days and hours! So everything I've tested so far, even Face ID works as expected, perfectly! Except for the price, there is nothing to complain about this phone :) but who likes a reliable phone who is also willing to pay;)	1
I have the Iphone X on 3.11. ordered and on 16.11. I definitely had luck to get one so soon. I had the iphone 4, 5 and 6s and then I waited for something new, since in principle Apple did not really change much. I have to say with the X is definitely I think the design is great, the workmanship is immaculate and for me the most beautiful Iphone. The camera makes very good pictures, the display is great and I do not miss the homebutton at all, on the contrary, I find the wiping gestures a lot better. Face ID also works perfectly. The only thing I think is a pity that you no wireless headphone mitliefert and no Induktionsladegerät.Das the price would have to be already.Absolute Buy recommendation on my part.All other permanent Apple rumhacken should stop buy another phone, there is no compulsion to buy an "overpriced" Iphone. I think other smartphones synonymous good, Samsung and Huawei also make good phones However, I just like the operating system and the performance at Apple simply the best. Therefore, I do not spend the whole day so that I have to bag and have against Samsung ... ;-)	1
First of all: This review concerns the device in general, it describes my alltag experience in the last days. I have been using the device for 10 days, a display error or other problems that have been read in the press, I happily did not occur. Closing several app should be optimized in my opinion. Unlocking via Face-ID worked better and better, had first problem with unlocking while wearing glasses. Apple had been right here, the device gradually learns to know its user, so the face ID function smoothly after 3-4 days, even in very poor lighting conditions. Only the battery charging time bothers me a little. My previous Iphone 6s (battery about 1700mAh was fully charged after about 2h, the Iphone X (battery about 2700mAh) needed about 3.5h so soon twice as long Apple would have been able to place a quick charger at this price instead of a standard charger. All the negative reviews regarding wealth and the very high price in my opinion have nothing to look for. Clearly, the price of this device is very high, but should also the innovations of the device and One should also keep in mind the Preisstabiltät the Iphones in comparison to other providers. Therefore, I can say with absolute certainty that this device currently under no circumstances reviews under 3 stars has earned. How the device next months, years interspersed will show up.	1
Absolutely solid smartphone with good new technology, as it should be. The problems that some describe here I can not confirm. The new features are well-developed, nothing that has errors somewhere or anything, I'm happy with it. That's better than the old one is probably the prerequisite if I get such a device, because I think I need not think about it, that should be clear to everyone here. On the plus side, of course, it is at a high level where I would think it scares off customers. I myself got it from the employer, but I would refrain from spending over 1000 ¬ spend. There is really more important in life where you spend your money on than for things that are written off after 2 years. I do not want to influence anyone now, that everyone should decide for themselves. I am since the 3er, users of the devices of Apple and are therefore already obsessively bound to have to take each new but which should not be a shortcoming. All in all, but good device, with which you can work properly.	1
Right at the beginning, I have the Iphone x not yet, it is ordered, the delivery times should also be known here. Of course, I read everything on the net that could be found. And that's a lot like any new iphone. Such interest can not be found on any Android mobile phone. By contrast, the media hype is gigantic and also leads to the fact that the iphones can be sold at all. Whatever and here on Amazon is to read as the biggest criticism of the price is called. If the price hurts so much, why are these people buying the iphone anyway? I myself have always indulged in every new iphone, whether that makes sense, everyone must decide for themselves. Today's mobile phone is no longer just a phone, on the contrary, the phone function is moving more and more into the background. Rather, it has become a toy (see Animojis etc.), more or less like a game console or something. It can also be classified as a mobile PC, of ​​course, the design plays a major role. It was always the same and so it will be synonymous with the X, the highly praised innovations such as super display, Hombutton yes or no, FaceID, A11 processor, etc. If you look at it completely sober, the so-called improvements are not so noticeable and as great as announced. Marktstratiegie !!! People just talk about it. With each new iphone, it is always a new, supposedly sharper display, but if you look closely, the difference to its predecessor is never so great. Sharp are and were all. In addition, you get used to it too fast and then it does not notice anyway. The strategy of Apple is quite clear: An iphone is no longer a luxury item, but it has become a mass product. But with devices like the X in this price range, the iphones will once again become luxury items and thus be satire symbols, as is proven by the constant price discussions. And in the present time, status symbols are more important than many think. However, people also afford the X, which is actually hard to raise these amounts for an iphone, after the delivery then often begins the whining, which is reflected in all the forums. No new iphone will ever be as innovative as the 1.iPhone, the topic is completely exhausted. I'm sure the next iphone generations will be even more expensive and it will now be m.E. always run so that there will be iphones in different price ranges, including an overpriced top model. But if you look at it closely, an iphone 8 plus costs more than 900 ¬, since the difference to X with 64 GB and 1149 ¬ ​​is actually not so big as to take the outdated design, but with current technology. The price is so relativiert.Und if I still have to read that even not included wireless airpods or missing a wireless charging station, I can only laugh. The apple airpods cost around 180 €, who can seriously ask for that a manufacturer of so expensive earphones can settle just so, I do not know the calculation for an iphone, but with such fun, apple will not come on the production costs and the cost of development here knows no, low will certainly not be. I also do not want to know how many employees Apple employs, which are horrendous personnel costs, something like that is quickly forgotten. Of course, it's clear that Apple makes a profit, that must be the goal of every company. These are completely childish ways of thinking and have nothing to do with commercial behavior. I personally did not even want the airpods, I only use beats wireless like studio or powerbeats, but only incidentally. What good is Airpods, if they are not my wish headphones, somehow they would pay me anyway. Then many would say, why the Airpods, better would be a lesser Preis.Man can often read on the net, a cell phone is a commodity: Wrong! An iphone for at least 1149 € is no longer a commodity, it is a valuable item! comparable to more expensive watches or similar .... and so you have to look at it and treat it. As you can tell, this is not a review, it's an attempt to explain how the iphone x can be seen, namely as a design-wise very nice, interesting smartphone with some, but not earth-shattering innovations. I will buy it, but I think it's not a must have, especially if you have other iphones.	1
For a change, I'll keep it short: the iPhone X is by far the best smartphone. Samsung and Android are far behind this premium product and this nagging about Apple is just annoying!	1
Apple sets new standards with its new battleship IPhone X with the razor-thin OLED display and the double camera, the recordings up to 4K. Of course, one can argue about whether a 4K camera in a mobile phone is necessary.Auch nothing can stutter, that the price of 1319 € is a new record and not from bad parents! So the full score concerns the iPhone XAber quite honestly what has ridden here this third party suppliers or what have you smoked 200-700 ¬ charge more than the manufacturer Apple itself? - by the way I can write this review with a clear conscience, since I am the day of Idea was there and it could test! @ Duke if you are not clear with his financial or not in the pay grade with you should just keep your hands off it. It is not a slap to the consumer, as no one is obliged to buy the IPhone X! @ MoBloS and rubber boss: As I said there are people who could test the iPhone X already and therefore can submit a review! First think and then talk / write!	1
The best thing about the iPhone 10 is the price. Yes, that's right. It is still too cheap. I buy the x just because it's expensive. There is no better mobile phone than the iPhone x.	1
This is the best or the best smartphone in the world. In addition, the new camera system "True Depht Camera" convinced me to buy an iPhone X.	1
I have the iphone 7 plus 256 gb am very at peace I have seen it in Internet for 989 ¬ then I am to Media Mark because it was for 1.289 euros best in Internet compare then you get it cheaper synonymous then I have it synonymous for 989 get the photos are very good I was thrilled before I had a Samsung S8 I had it 3 months of fun while shopping	1
I bought the iPhone X after the product launch of the successor model (XS). The higher price of the new model, I was not worth it because the new features of me certainly not needed werden.Mit the X I am very satisfied. Clearly to the conventional iPhones the operating concept is clearly different in some points but you get used to it quickly. FaceID I find great. As a somewhat older person, I already need reading glasses, but I can still clearly recognize the navigation and displayed information when driving. A nice added value to the previous iPhone 6+	1
The iPhone X was purchased through the Marketplace at A-Montain. The article was new and sealed. Whether it is 100% virgin, I can not judge, however, because in the sealed packaging dust in the columns around the camera has accumulated. Perhaps also normal for a longer storage or re-sealed refurbished Ware.Ansonsten I can connect to the actual product only the good reviews. Have long wondered if I zulege a Galaxy Note 9, Pixel 3 XL or just an iPhone X. Since I'm still in the Apple ecosystem, the choice fell on the iPhone X for 900 € at the Amazon Marketplace. The display is a dream. Finally OLED and big, without losing the compactness of the small iPhones. For OLED typical viewing angle-dependent color changes. The cameras and speakers are good as expected. Face ID works with me 100% reliable and fast, even in the dark. iOS 12 is expected to be super fast and at the same time super boring. Absolutely recommended for existing Apple customers or those looking for a change from Android.	1
The iPhone X as premium smartphone in the upper price segment has completely convinced me. My thanks, FaceID would not work reliably, the screen is too impractical, etc. were all unjustified. The smartphone works as an iPhone almost always smoothly and the interaction of software and hardware is awesome. The price is the only drawback with this device, which, however, was never considered a bargain. Apple was always more expensive than the competition, but (in my experience) always reliable (he). So who is looking for a smartphone with a TOP display, a really good camera and a fast processor is definitely right here! I can not complain about the battery life, for me it is as good as always more than a day with normal use. From me, the device gets an absolute buy recommendation for all those looking for a TOP smartphone, if not even the best. I wish all the fun that this device can call their own!	1
One of the best smartphones on the market (2018) a bit heavy but with an impressive performance. It's also beautiful to look at if you did not put it in a case. Face ID works great with me. Picture quality is outstanding in daylight at night shots can be improved. Video recordings are the best I have ever seen in a smartphone. (2018) The display is a feast for the eyes, but it could be a bit brighter but the colors and the resolution is extremely good.	1
The best iPhone I have so far. The camera and the screen are great. Had the iPhone 6 6s 7 before and was very satisfied. The x finally has a different design which is why I skipped the iPhone 8. Also handy is that you can charge it wirelessly. I would never buy anything other than an iPhone. Apple simply has the best service with which the Android competition can not match.	1
The people who made a bad review here are themselves to blame. If you do not choose Amazon as a supplier, but want the cheapest of the cheap, you should not be surprised. I am very satisfied with the iPhone X. Everything original packed. Again and again	1
After some negative comments, I was very pleasantly surprised. Delivery took a few days, but then arrived 3 days before the announcement. Sold by smart tech electronics, really everything flawless! Brand new OVP iPhone also checked at Apple and receive activation mail. I'm very happy with the phone, the only drawback, the battery .... I would have liked here, that you can endure a day well with a load. Unfortunately, one day is a little short for me, partly the battery is empty for the afternoon and has to be recharged. But in my experience has always been an Apple problem. Everything else is top, finally a working cell phone, before a still obsessed 6 which was really no longer usable, because simply too slow and faulty. Would buy the Xer again!	1
Years ago, I switched from IOS to Android (Sony and Samsung), as the limitations of the IOS were too stupid for me. Now I am back, because IOS has developed a bit and with the current limitations I can live, especially since there are huge internal memory. And in addition, you can now also external storage anschliessen.IOS is compared to Android by far better, also come bug fixes and innovations quickly. In particular, Samsung's policies are utterly idiotic, and months are waiting for new versions of Android to be made available. And after 2 years at the latest it is over. What is this? The iPhone has been repeatedly criticized the battery. The question arises, what and how is measured. My experience shows - especially in comparison to Samsung 7, which I had before - that the battery, although much smaller holds much longer, since the energy budget is much better controlled. The screen is great, the photos are very good, the memory is sufficient the speaker quality is much better. Cost twice as much, but you also have almost twice as much. And if you are content with the conventional format (iphone 7 and 8) you are not far from the Samsung price and at the height of Sony and recently Huawei.	1
When selling and shipping through Amazon absolutely new, original and perfectly working iPhone.Like the Apple Store: It comes shrink wrapped in its original packaging, all accessories included (even the Lightning on headphone jack adapter). The change from the iPhone 6 works without problems, I also do not miss the homebutton. Everything in all highly recommended, especially by the cheap price here (970 € in February 2019).	1
iPhone X makes much better photos than the iPhone 7. I missed the Touch ID at the beginning. The Face ID is not that fast, and you always have to look directly into the phone. It also has difficulties in the dark. Sonnst is just an iPhone, what else can one say? :-)	1
Fast, looks good, enough memory, top display. Camera is slightly over at the back. But this is done with Bumper. Super Phone	1
The iPhone X is really very well made and has a great camera and a fascinating display. My expectations were completely fulfilled, the quality is, as expected from Apple, very good.	1
Since I already own some Apple products and was always satisfied with i-Pad, I-Phone, EarPods. So I'm so excited about my I-Phone X so short and good who is willing to accept the prices of the decides again and again for Apple device	1
I'm very satisfied! My phone came new and still in foil. It works flawlessly, quite in contrast to the others!	1
I'm really excited about the iPhone X The price of 879 euros is not a little, but the performance of the iPhone is just great.	1
Top, best iPhone from Apple and really worth its money. Particularly noteworthy is the excellent display.	1
Top device for the price am very satisfied ,;)	1
Iphone X is very well made. There were high quality components installed. The phone has just the right size in my opinion. I would purchase it again. The price on Amazon was also top.	1
Excellent	1
I am very pleased the iPhone is new as described and welded the delivery has even been a day less. More is not possible.	1
This is my first iPhone. I had an LG4 before. I'm glad about my purchase decision. Great phone.	1
Apple iOS or Google Android, I had to answer this question for me first. For this purpose, there was only one thing: I had half an year now an Android Phone from the house Xiaomi, admittedly in a much lower price range. That was enough for me but to answer the question: for me personally (!) IOS is simply the system for smartphones. This for the following reason: actually I find the pricing policy of the company from California quite questionable, say the products (too) expensive. Now the iPhone X itself. I've been thinking back and forth about whether it should be an iPhone with a classic home button or an X. My consideration: I get a handy smartphone with more actual display area at the X and that's an absolute plus you just have to mention , For News Apps, I see more of the text. More from the video on YouTube, more in photos of this, top! FaceID was a necessary innovation and this just works 1A. Whether in daylight or lowlight, with or without sunglasses, behind it is a sophisticated algorithm that obviously only a few key features of the face correctly needed to recognize the respective user. What was particularly important to me? The camera, battery life and the display. Let's start from the back: the display (OLED) is "premium" for me. The resolution (ppi) is very high, so it stands out against the Xr, which I did not buy for exactly this reason. The color space is without measurement already felt larger than other smartphones I had in the hand, the contrast as well. I think on relevant websites there are also according to measurements. Also noteworthy: zero "streaking" (Ghosting, clouding is what I think). Of course you can expect the price. But it must also be mentioned that then everything really fits. The battery life is simply very good. The battery itself has 2700 mAh, if I'm informed correctly. That alone is just a component, a smartphone must also have a reasonable energy management. In short: the battery life is great. Yesterday I navigated for two hours continuously with gmaps, photos and videos made all day surfing the internet and had about.30%. Especially when you consider that navigation is a pretty energy-intensive app (processor, GPS and display consistently active) I think that's very good. With normal daily use I get about 30-40% of the capacity over the day, which is why I charge the iPhone usually only to 80%, which spares the battery! Now finally to the camera, for me a top aspect when buying a smartphone. The main camera (s) delivers fantastic pictures. Here I also notice a major difference to Android on: since Apple developed the camera app itself, the pictures are synonymous top and I do not need to mess around with settings, so I expect that, otherwise I can take a DSLR in the hand. For Android, at least I had the impression that the result depends very much on the app used and their own settings. The portrait mode delivers pictures like from a DSLR, of course with lower resolution, the panorama mode is as I already knew it to top level. Of course, "normal" pictures are great as well. All in all, the camera is for me on a premium level, as I expect. I think there's something going on in the next smartphone generations but when I see what manufacturers are already getting out of such a puny lens, I think that's a technical feat in general. The front camera also delivers great pictures for the reduced resolution that it brings with it. Again, the portrait mode is available and really delivers even with selfies amazing results. All other aspects that I have not mentioned now at least for me are not negative. The only thing that could possibly be mentioned is maybe the weight, it could be a bit lighter. But hey, somehow it is clear that all the technology, battery and the high-quality housing weigh something or "I can recommend the iPhone X until now, have it for about 1.5 months. I also recommend it before the Xr because of the display (OLED vs LCD, resolution ppi) and the camera and compared to the Xs because of the slightly better price. If you treat the phone well, you should not forget that iPhones also have a good resale price i.d.R. A TOP smartphone that convinced me that there is still innovation in Apple.	1
Have the X, coincidentally, since it is on the market, so for quite a long time. It's still THE phone for me. Everything works like the first day. Maybe that's why. Initially, in addition to the seven-euro case was still a screen protector on it, but I have removed after a week again. It does not really fit, because of the arched glass. Dust and dirt then collects between the case and screen protector - so no eye-catcher. The sheath protrudes over the edge and that's enough for me. I would like the original from Apple, the leather is already cool, but I do not like the bulge for the speakers. But this is now a minor matter ... The X can be operated super, the home button was never missing, on the contrary, the intuitive wiping I already knew of Nokia's N9 and it was time that other phones have this feature. Face recognition is great , but I would wish that this also works in the car (holder). From thirty centimeters is over. I think that's because the eyes can not be captured properly anymore. (The phone can not unlock even if I'm sleeping). Videos look better than photos. The display is excellent. Even after hours, my eyes are not annoyed. That's probably the OLED. As a Navy (etc.) offers the size of the display in relation to the size of the phone real advantages, even if I think of iPhone 7 (also a super mobile phone) or 8. A battery has my phone too. When it's empty I charge it up. Goes almost everywhere. IOS is pretty good. Unfortunately, Apple does not call me to ask what could be improved. The price was and is insane - but would buy it again anytime. If it's too expensive, buy a Simson. At the moment, however, the phone is almost 300 euros cheaper than the market launch - I think that makes the X a snap. And if I can do without a navy on the way, I still have the SE. That's it. With original Apple case.	1
Even if you have Adobe Premiere Pro CC installed (which has hitherto processed any H.265 file up to 8k resolution without any problems), any attempt to open the not completely compatible Apple MOV container of the iPhone X, together with the HEVC files of other manufacturers, will result in to a crash of the program. And that, as soon as one clicks on the Apple files in the library only! Unfortunately, one has no choice but to post-process the videos before offering them to other websites for sale. For while even a simple 4K camcorder like the Panasonic HC-VXF11 makes the night practically the day and you can still see the blue sky over the city at 2 o'clock in the morning, the iPhone X videos show only deep black areas in the same places. If you then move the exposure control upwards, not more details will appear. The black areas just turn into rushing gray! Maybe Apple should disassemble a Huawei phone and find out how they turn their videos at night. There are real worlds in between on dark streets and neon-lit clubs. High tech scrap is everywhere. But for the price you really expect something else.	1
Have the iPhone X with 64 Gb for 1 year in the possession and I'm quite satisfied! The display is amazing! You get used to working without the HomeButten very fast. Crisp pictures and the madness 4K at 60 frames per second is awesome! Processing is noble and high quality. Ergonomic housing and is super comfortable in the hand. Due to the glass back it is slightly slippery, but in combination with the original Apple Leather Case the whole is super finished! The price is of course pretty high .. I decided to get 64 Gb and upgrade iCloud to 200 Gb. I am very satisfied and can only recommend the device!	1
I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone X. There were several natural options to buy the device. Ultimately, I decided for the first time to buy me a mobile phone on Amazon. The phone was packed very well. It was in an original packaging, which was also sealed. Thus, I can not understand some feedback here, that should be used here cell phones. All the best, I'm satisfied.	1
... about this noble part, and professional-competent reviews are certainly a better guide. But I want to highlight an aspect that is not naturally so much in the center of interest, but for me as a hearing impaired was the key argument, which is why I have now "switched from Android to IOS" "and just me for this perfect device ( Design, appearance and functionality): The direct streaming of telephone (call and conversation) and all other audio services on compatible modern hearing aids via Bluetooth means a gain in quality of life, for me in addition to everything that still offers such a mobile phone , is enormous. In contrast to Android, this direct audio streaming is integrated directly into the menu at IOS and in my opinion testifies to a committed developer horizons. The full functionality of the hearing aids is also displayed, so that the mobile phone serves as a complete control unit for the hearing aids (this is available for my hearing aid brand via app, in contrast to the use as wireless headphones for selected Android devices). Yes, and in my device, everything works great ... Maybe for others, another great purchase argument?	1
Have now been a week the Space Gray with 64 Gb and I'm totally excited! The display is amazing! FaceID is easily detected with scarf, hat, glasses, baseball cap etc .. Sharp sharp pictures and the hammer 4K recording with 60 frames per second !!! The design and finish typical Apple high quality and feels like a high end top device in the hand. Due to the glass back it is slightly slippery, but with the original Apple leather case nicely finished, so that the device is protected and gets a great grip. The price is high ... 64 Gb is really too lean for such a device, which alone requires the iOS a lot of gigabytes apart from then synonymous of the 4K recordings. Have it but nice with iCloud upgrade to 200 Gb solved! A great piece and absolutely to be recommended!	1
I switched from the 6s to the X and very satisfied Face ID works fast and easy, I have the feeling that the more often you unlock the cellphone it goes the faster. The mailed by the dealer from Barcelona was also absolutely smooth. The phone was versiegetl delivered to me without SIM lock. And I still trust Apple more with my personality date than a cheaper manufacturer.	1
I switched from an iPhone 6s to the iPhone X, apart from the price I'm really blown away. Face ID works 98% of the time, as good if not better than Touch ID. Since I work as a car mechatronic Touch ID often times did not work, because I had very dry hands or had a scar from time to time or scratched Finger.Haptik, look and quality is of course Apple typical non plus ultra in my eyes. The new Camera and the OLED display are just terrific! The price is of course very high, but everyone has to know whether it is a value or not. Since I need my smartphone very often due to a quick change in my job and also need it more often, I was well worth the price.	1
I do not know if I'm the right person to review such a product. The Iphone x is the first Apple product I own. Previously, I was a self-confessed supporter of Samsung. Am still synonymous. Small vorgesichte how it came to my Samsung Galaxy S8 has a massive display damage and the repair would have cost me just 300 ¬. Since I wanted to get me a good travel camera (which is synonymous with just under 700/800 €) both was unfortunately not an option. With a broken display to walk through the area but unfortunately not. So started the search for a cell phone with a great camera. Since I had exactly 3 devices to choose from. Iphone 8 plus (which is too big and unwieldy for me), The Samsung Glaxy S9 (unfortunately at the time only 4 weeks on the market and as new phones mostly bugs have much synonymous out this) and then last but not least the Iphone X. .  What can I say. I am more than happy. And that says a bislnag Apple supporter. I am frog that I have chosen this device. Due to the fact that it has no button any more, the handling is similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8. The photo quality (which is important to me), I think for a cell phone really outstanding. It will now be put to the test in the upcoming holiday, but I'm really looking forward to trying it out. The operation is easier than I thought (but I'm convinced that it's because the phone has no homebutton anymore). The display sharpness and color scheme, I think synonymous really good. Unfortunately, I can not score with so much technical knowledge. I can only say that the battery lasts longer than my Samsung Galaxy S8. The only disadvantage compared to the Samsung is actually that no fast charging cable from Werkauf is here. This is sometimes a bit annoying and I had to get used to something. But otherwise it covers almost all areas of the Samsung. I'm really excited about the Iphone X: D	1
Now I went from the iPhone 8 to the iPhone 10 because I wanted a bigger display, and finally Face ID, and it's really very comfortable! Despite the missing home button I get along very well, it would have expected worse! Already used to it after 1 day. And finally an iPhone that does not look like 6,7,8! Battery life is about the same as the 8er.	1
Best smartphone so far. Battery lasts for me ~ 2 days! Workmanship is incredibly good. 64 GB are perfectly adequate for me. Highly recommended!	1
+ Great smartphone, which runs on IOS and not on Microsoft and therefore has a much improved App Auswahl.Das iPhone has a completely new housing and display. It was important to me that I do not constantly have to learn new functions and know how the mobile phone works. Otherwise, I would have ordered the lower versions.- The biggest minus is the much too high price, while the Samsung 8 is also in the same league and cheaper. The many warnings about Samsung 8 (Android) have made me choose the iPhone without being able to compare the Samsung 8 with it. Performance of the two phones are probably similar only the new iPhone X has given me a higher security for the future	1
Have the X for a few days now, and I have to say I'm excited. Switch from the iPhone 7 and it's a huge leap. The display is absolutely sensational, the size, the resolution, the representation of the colors, just perfect! Personally, I find Face ID to be a bit more sophisticated and more comfortable than Touch ID, but that's a matter of taste. At least it works perfectly, face is always reliably detected, even in the dark. The use without Home Button goes quickly into flesh and blood, I do not miss the home button. The only criticism, if you can call it that, is the lack of customization of some apps, but that's just a matter of time. Camera is as expected top, performance is great, even nice little things like the X detects when you actively look at the display and when a message or a call comes is automatically silent. So the price is amazing, but after 1 hour of use I did not think about it anymore. Also, setting up with the quick start feature in iOS 11 and my iCloud backup was really easy and ran smoothly, as makes a change fun, as some manufacturers could take an example. TOP And finally again something to the 1 star reviews "overpriced bla bla". Galaxy Note 8 also costs 1000 €, cars for 80.000 € are sold, watches for thousands, jewelry and handbags for thousands of € ... I use a smartphone daily, so why not, everyone can spend his money for what he wants, that's what you work for.	1
The delivery was fast and punctual. I am very satisfied with this iPhone. The read reviews, I can only confirm. A defect I must nevertheless cite: the flyer for a first guide were unfortunately only in languages ​​incomprehensible to me. Why are not these also settled in German? That would be at least a little customer friendly.	1
Nothing else to say. The price is not worth it. There are many other phones that do the same, but for a lower price.	1
Mega good IPhone, beautiful design (ordered in silver / white) reminds a little of the iPhone 4 from behind. At the notch and that there is no homebottom, you get used pretty fast. Of course, the price is exaggerated, but for Appleliebhaber I can only recommend it anyway.	1
I have the iPhone X now three months and have it in continuous use. It's true, yes, it is the best iPhone so far - but it must be at a price of about € 1,000 (depending on the dealer, as of, 1.3.2018) For the sake of simplicity, a short listing follows the Pro / Neutral / Contra- Scheme.Pro: - Display, but Notch is a habit at the beginning, but after a while it does not bother me at all, otherwise it's the OLED panel Perfectly illuminated and the color fidelity is very good Speaker: neat for a smartphone control with gestures works very well, the home button is not missing, all major iOS apps are now optimized for the iPhone X Speed: here it is missing nothing, it is also the fastest smartphone for time-processing: at flagship level, the highest quality materials, processed to the finest detail- size of the housing is also great for one-handed operation- Battery: hä lasts 1-2 days depending on how strong you use the smartphone, in addition, the charging option with wireless Qi standard is finally available and faster charging with a strong power adapter (unfortunately not included) - Cameras: very sharp shots and the front Camera captures very nice details of the eyes in selfies, the two rear cameras are good, with these still up potential is present (but is criticism at a high level), especially when Fokus- Face ID: works fine and learns fast In addition, the iPhone recognizes me now even from unusual positions (eg you lie in bed and looks diagonally on the smartphone), in my opinion, much more practical than Touch ID, especially in winter with gloves superNeutral: - games (Animoji o. Ä.) - Telephone functions, the reception is sufficient, but could better-price: contrary to my opinion, I think this is appropriate, you get exclusive key features that the competition (still) does not offer, v. a. Face ID is undisputedly the best and most secure face unblocking delivery: okay, although a quick charger at the price could be there already - 64 GB of memory are just okay with the priceKontra: - jack connection is missing, I can not imagine that it has failed in the field and I also do not understand why it is already removed, where there are very few really good Bluetooth headphones (the trend currently affects many new smartphones) - now and then some apps crash (eg File manager), software updates often help, but sometimes it's annoying. You get a really great iPhone, whose price-performance ratio is quite ok. The positive features are clear, but I would only 4.5 Awarded stars, because the iPhone X is not perfect. Due to the lack of opportunity on Amazon to evaluate a product with 4.5 stars, the rating is rounded up to 5 stars. Conclusion: Despite the high price, I can highly recommend the iPhone X, I'm really satisfied and currently it is the most original smartphone on the market!	1
In the following report, I would like to pass on my experience with the new iPhone X. I have chosen the 64GB version in the color Space Gray. *** Packaging *** The packaging is typical as you know it from Apple. On the front is now the front of the iPhone to see X.Ein nice detail is that the stainless steel frame on the packaging is again highlighted. In addition, the box is now wrapped in a plastic wrap, which you can raise quickly by means of a tab *** The scope of supply has also changed this year nothing. In addition to the power plug, Lightning cable and the Lightning headphones is also this time again because of the lack of a jack jack steckelegt.Etwas a shame I think that the headphones (and the adapter) even in the last models only stuck in a cardboard holder and not as it once was in a small plastic box. *** Design *** The design is the biggest innovation of the iPho ne X. Finally, the iPhone has received a new design after the last few years. The display now takes almost the entire front, the corners are rounded and fit very well into the overall picture. The above omission for the camera technology made for I like the design well, others not. You have to say very clearly that it is a pure matter of taste. Flavors are different and that's a good thing. *** Processing *** The iPhone X is really top processed , It feels really high quality and you can tell directly that you have to do it with a premium device. At the high price, it would be bad if it were not so. The transitions from the display to the stainless steel frame to the glass back are really perfect and clean worked. There is nothing to complain about. In addition, all the buttons have a pleasant and crisp pressure point without something wobbling. So that should be synonymous. The glass back is very anf mature for fingerprints, in the dark version you can see this even more clearly. The camera on the back is now arranged vertically and stands out a bit again. This does not look quite as perfect. *** Memory *** The iPhone X is If you like to watch movies offline and often shoot videos, especially in 4K, then you should definitely opt for a larger memory option. I myself manage with 64GB memory very well, because Whenever I rotate videos, I always transfer them to the computer to save memory. Here everyone can decide for themselves how much memory is suitable for the personal user experience. *** Display * ** When the display is Apple first on an OLED display. The colors are great, the contrast is really good, the brightness is also very good, even in a brighter environment or outside i m outdoors. The colors are not quite as gaudy as Samsung, but they are very lively and colorful without being too oversaturated. The viewing angles are very good, but not optimal. In a white background, for example, this is a bit bluish In normal everyday use, this is almost never on, but it must be mentioned. True Tone is there again, but I personally think nothing of it. In the iPhone 7 Plus, I've never used this feature , because I do not like the colors and I will not synonymous with the iPhone X machen.Beim iPhone X change the colors with activated True sound just too strong, so it does not look nice. Despite the criticism of the angle is the new OLED Display for me the most beautiful display which ever existed in an iPhone.*** Loudspeaker *** Also with the iPhone X were installed now 2 loudspeakers which should provide for stereo quality. A loudspeaker is as usual on the lower side, the second loudspeaker gives out the sound over the earpiece. The sound is clearly clear and loud and it is fun to watch videos and listen to music. The quality of the speakers is at the same level as the Plus models. I could not find any differences or hear it better. *** Battery *** The battery is indeed a little bit larger than the Plus models, however, I notice in my user behavior no negative and no positive effects. The running time is about the same. Who also came well with the iPhone 7 Plus through the day, will have no problems here .Two days are also possible if you pay attention when using the battery. For me, the battery life is definitely satisfactory. In addition, the iPhone X also supports wireless Charging. All charging pads that support the QI standard can be used. This is actually atypical for Apple, but for the user all the prettier that a widespread charging technology is used. I use the current Wireless Charging Pad from Samsung. Fast Charging also supports the iPhone X. , but you have to buy a separate power supply for it. I did not and I will not in the future. *** Performance *** The new A11 Bionic processor is used. This is the same processor, which also with the iPhone 8 Everything works very smoothly. Whether switching between apps, opening apps, zooming, wiping and scrolling, everything runs very smoothly and quickly. Ruckler I could not find any. Even very complex games run smoothly. Furthermore, AR apps are running without any problems and very smooth. The overall performance and the interaction between software and hardware is really great. Differences to the iPhone 8 / Plus does not exist. *** Face ID *** Besides the design Face ID is the second major innovation. Because of Face ID, there is now no longer the usual Home Button with Touch ID. Face ID is something completely different and in the run-up you really could not be sure how reliable this new technology works in an iPhone. I must honestly say that I am very very positively surprised. The setup is very fast and simple. After the face has been scanned Face ID can be used. On the lock screen is a small lock to see, this symbolizes whether the iPhone locked or unlocked After successful unlocking, you have to swipe up and you immediately come to the home screen. In the beginning, it is a bit strange, because you are in the last year Everything is new, is always unusual at the beginning. But Face ID works so well that you get used to it very quickly. I really did not expect that getting used to so well. With the Time I missed the home button also not at all, at least that's the case with me. In everyday use, I noticed the following things: -As advertised, Face ID also works with a hat, scarf or sunglasses and the same speed.-If the eyes Face ID does not work, even if you close your eyes behind a pair of sunglasses, it does not work.-Face ID works in normal daylight, in bright lighting, under artificial light and outdoors without any problems.-When the room is completely dark Face ID also works very well. -You do not have to hold the iPhone X exactly in front of the face.Face ID works even if you look from the side or from top to bottom.-Face ID can be unlocked This works even faster than it did with Touch ID. So far, I'm really happy with Face ID and it works really well. In the beginning it is indeed a a little bit unfamiliar but you get used to it very quickly. *** Animojis *** Animojis are a nice gimmick and it shows really well what is possible with the new camera, but nothing more. I have to honestly say that this feature at least I was interested in it and I will probably use it as well as never. The technique behind it I like, but everything else is as I said just a gimmick. *** everyday use *** The iPhone X is about as large as an iPhone 7/8 and the display size is about the same as the iPhone 7/8 Plus, but a little bit narrower. You can tell synonymous. Because the iPhone X is now more compact than a plus device, it is also better in Hand.Man realizes clearly that it is not so clumsy and one-handed operation is also possible again. I have rather small hands and still it works quite well. The form factor is really a very good compromise of compact Size and large Display.Außerdem you get the iPhone X now also better in the trouser pocket.Dadurch that the display is a bit narrower than the Plus models, the keyboard was also a little narrower.When typing with one hand, this is an advantage the new gestures, which are now required because the homebutton is missing, are learned quickly and getting used to is faster than expected.Thus, after a short time, you are quickly used to w I need to close an app. There are not yet all apps for the iPhone X adjusted. Unmatched apps have a black bar at the top and bottom. I hope that all apps will be updated gradually and this will not take too long. The change between the apps with the help of the bar at the bottom of the screen is very very fast and flüssig.Die percentage of the battery can only be seen in the controller center and not at the top of the bar. The top recess for the camera is definitely a matter of taste. Some find it ugly the other likes it well. This recess is not as annoying as the beginning perhaps was suspected. Even with videos in full screen mode you take this recess after a short time no longer true and you pay attention. Ich could in connection therewith no negative problems which disturb me personally. The distance between the keyboard and the bottom of the screen is too large. That does not look really nice and it was given away a lot of space. Siri is now activated by the power button. It works just as well as before with the Homebutton. *** Camera *** The pictures with the new camera make a very good impression. Both the colors and the contrast are even better than the iPhone 7 Plus. In addition, the colors look nice natural. Also at In low-light conditions, the camera now makes much better pictures. One can really take first-class pictures. The second lens of the dual camera b there is now also an image stabilization, this is not the case with the iPhone 8 Plus. The front camera now also has a portrait mode.The quality of selfies has become a little better and even if I'm not a big selfie fan I have to say that you can now synonymous with the front camera really good pictures können.Skypen or make calls via Facetime also works in very good quality Video quality is synonymous positively hervorzuheben.4K with 60 frames per second film is synonymous with the iPhone X möglich.Die quality of the videos is very good. The image is super fluid and sharp. These recordings but also need a lot of space. Like nature photography, Videos from and with friends or videos from the family, the camera gives very good results. Right big differences to the iPhone 8 / Plus but there is not. *** Price *** That the iPhone X is again much more expensive, was actually no Surprise as it was already speculated months before. The price has nothing to do with whether a device is bad or good, but I would like to say a few words Maybe I have a wrong view, but there is one thing that bothers me which I have already criticized the MacBook Pro 2016. I think it's not good in what way the prices are raised. Everything is a bit more expensive is unfortunately It started in my opinion with the iPad. It gave the iPad the name suffix "Pro" to make it even more expensive, although the iPad Pro was actually just a normal annual development of the iPad Air . In the Macbook Pro, the touch bar was the big change. But to make the price even more expensive to have a slimmed down version without Touch Bar published. In the iPhone X, it is in my opinion exactly the same. I think you have it iPhone 8 / Plus with the now old and boring design only released to the iPhone X as a "special model" with a significant surcharge to sell. For me is But it is not a special model but the actual iPhone 8.Trotz but you have to say that Apple has done everything right, because otherwise the demand would not have been so great and many others, as well as me included, would not have bought the iPhone X. * ** Conclusion *** Finally, Apple has released the iPhone in a new design. The anticipation was very great as well as the expectations and until now, it has really been fully worth it. The new iPhone X is really an excellent smartphone, with a very nice design (a matter of taste), a great display and has with Face ID a new technology on board which although a little bit of getting used to, but after a short time becomes a habit and reliable works. The high price is indeed a bitter aftertaste but here Everyone has to decide for themselves whether they are willing to spend so much money on a smartphone or rather not. Regardless of the price, I can open the new iPhone X. recommend each case and I am very satisfied with it. You get a both technically and qualitatively very high quality processed smartphone which is one of the best devices on the market today Supplement: I added some pictures, which the iPhone X compared with a Galaxy Note 8 show.The Kicker App is for example not yet adjusted.All non-customized apps have top and bottom bars.The Bild.de App you can see both displays in direct Größenvergleich.Nachtrag 2: Depending on the device, it may happen that at different angles a white background turns from blue to yellow.This little problem can be solved by yourself.1.True Activate Sound2.When Display Adjustments - Activate Color Filter3. Activate Color Touch4. Set intensity between A and T5. Set the color tone between blue and purple (The pens at the top are the orientation) Then the display is as it should be. True tone can then be deactivated again.	1
Have this smartphone already 4 months in operation & must say it is a feast for the eyes the display .. the handling the handling Grandios .. The sound from the boxes a dream .. quickly without end, everything works as it should .. The Camera is a dream this incredible sharpness the video recording top no jerking no overloads ... just terrific and yes what you should say cool! Battery could hold more but you can easily through the day:) Wireless Charge is the madness when Apple accessories The price has already been turned down to just under the Apple price for under € 900 for the 64GB! Since I now like to muck out my smartphone the 64GB are enough for me completely .. 128 GB would have been ok but it works :) Would not want to exchange it, with original Apple Case Case a dream Screen Protector glass should definitely be installed because the repair costs can be quite high without AppleCare!	1
I now have the new smartphone flagship from Apple in use. Enough time to give a small conclusion. I will divide this recession into categories, so every self can read the part that interests him. I will deal with the following points: 1. Design2. Screen3. Kamera4. Face ID5. Software6. Power / battery7. InnovationsFinally a conclusion Let's start.1. DesignThe design of the iPhone X reminds at first glance of a mixture of iPhone 4 and iPhone 6. And basically it is. Like the iPhone 4, two glass panes are framed by a stainless steel frame. The shape comes from the iPhone 6th In this point, Apple remains faithful for 3 years.Das weight has changed significantly. While since the iPhone 5 rather lightweights produced by Apple, the iPhone X is now a heavyweight. This weight always gives you the feeling that I hold a high quality in my hand. In terms of design, Apple has not given anything away. Despite the omission of the typical home button, it still has an iPhone appearance. A big difference, in addition to the mentioned Home Button, is the screen. And I'll go to the next point.2. Screen The biggest difference, and basically the difference everyone else pulls, is the screen. If you look at the first power on the display, you immediately think Apple would have just tried everything in space to provide it with screen. This is true. A thin edge goes around the device, otherwise you only have screen in hand. The presentation is just great, this Apple has increased again. When the black levels Apple "finally" "ran to the competition. But this is only due to the OLED technology. A technology that is so new that Android has only been using it for several years. Because sometimes you do not understand why Apple closes itself to such technologies. As in the predecessors, Apple has also incorporated its 3D Touch on the iPhone X. A nice technology, which, in my opinion, is still underestimated.Very sad. Now I have written this above as if the display had not a single flaw. This is true. If the view goes from the bottom up you only see screen, well, until you arrive at the top. Here, Apple has the new famous Notch. An indentation in a near-perfect screen. While in normal operation (read emails, use Instagram) you do not notice this notch. For videos, but this begins. Here, the user has the choice between black borders on both sides, while the impression of an iPhone 6 is awakened. When watching a video in 2: 1 format, one piece of video is cut away from one edge. Some say that you do not notice, I myself prefer watching videos in the iPhone 6 design. Maybe this will be eliminated in the next generations.3. CameraAfter the screen we come to the camera. This was improved here again. Now videos can be recorded in 4k at 60 frames per second. The photo quality also increased again. Here is shown again, the old Urlaubsknipser cameras have had their day. Like the iPhone 8 Plus (and 7 Plus), the iPhone X has a dual lens camera. Here, another focal length is used for the second lens. This gives you an optical zoom. This is handy in some situations. However, in my eyes, no Kaufgrund.Was rather for the dual lens camera speaks is the portrait mode. This is just a gimmick and according to Apple in the moment still a beta. This one notices when using too. Some pictures are super sharp and the effects are also very nice, others you notice bad Photoshop. The hair is cut off and here and there even area in the face are cut off. This will probably take some development on the part of Apple.Von the quality of the pictures you can not complain, only in the dark, the focus likes times. But that is not tragic.4. Face ID Let's get from the back camera to the front camera. This has also improved Apple. By eliminating the Home Button Apple waives the Touch ID sensor. The new technology is called Face ID.And this works amazingly well and exactly. The added value is already noticeable when setting up. While the finger on the Touch ID has to be put on several times to teach in 1 finger, Face ID requires only two turns of the head. The speed is felt faster than Face ID. A quick look is enough. Very often it happens to me that I just want to see the time and it is unlocked. I think the Face ID Touch ID will be 100% replaced. It is safe and can not be tricked by a simple photo. To the point that South Korean explorer Face ID tricked with a mask. In my eyes, this is just scary. You would have to take several pictures of the face and make the mask with a 3D printer. This takes time. With Touch ID, only one glass with the fingerprint is sufficient.5. Software Apple has its latest software bundled with the iPhone X. iOS 11 runs stable and brings many new features. In my opinion, the functions are just a normal development. The software is not as stable as it should be. With the iPhone X have felt a few new bugs occurred. So some apps on the iPhone X do not run on other devices without problems. Here Apple will probably still have to help by various updates. Feels like the hardware is too modern for the software.6. Performance / Battery Let's get on with the performance. The new iPhone (8, 8 Plus and X) has the new A11 processor. And this is currently the top model in the smartphone market. Several tests show this. This high performance can now be used for app developers to get the most out of their ideas. This power also needs Strom.Beim battery Apple has not improved much. With average use, I can easily create 2 days. There were already 3 days in it. In intensive use one day is easy to master. How it compares to other top models in the smartphone market, I can not say. Here others like to say how the iPhone beats in comparison.Innovations Let us now turn to other small innovations. With the new iPhones Apple has now installed a wireless shop. A practical innovation with the device just needs to be placed on a surface and is charged. Here you have to be very careful which cover you use. I had two in use so far. The first one has led to frequent crashes (1 night loading from 15% -> to 83%). The second case was not a problem. A very good technology that shows how innovative Apple is. This technique is also so new that other manufacturers have only been selling it since 2012. Apple will probably always go quite sure that it will be worthwhile. Due to the new technology, I use the attached Lightning cable currently no longer. Conclusion: Who decides to buy an iPhone X gets a very high quality device for a proud price of over 1000 €. Here the ghosts divorce if the price justifies itself. Allegedly the production costs an iPhone X approx. 300 €. In my opinion, the price is okay. For what you get at least. Whether some people are willing to pay this price is up to you. You get a really sophisticated smartphone for your money which is in all areas on the state 2017/2018. Performance / Screen / Camera / Face ID / Wireless Charging. Everything is now up to date after a few years and at the current time Apple can even outperform their competitors in all respects in the front games and in many areas. The iPhone 8 is a little further back here. With the iPhone X, Apple is ringing their new design line in the smartphones and how it will be in the future to be seen. I can give a buy recommendation, but everyone should go to an Apple Store and take the device in hand. Who has an iPhone 7 should wait in my eyes with the purchase. Anyone who has an iPhone 6s can dare the change without a guilty conscience. One look at Android vs iOS: Both systems are an eternal battle and never will be a winner. If one is an Android fan he will surely only find bugs while an Apple fan will surely find some bugs on Android. Everyone should make their own opinion on this topic. It is the iPhone X is a strong smartphone which has weaknesses and the same would synonymous with a Samsung / HTC, etc. write. In this recession, I deliberately did not compare with other devices because I did not use them. I just want to make it clear that comments on these points can stay away. This concludes my recession. If something changes in the next few months (long-term), I will supplement this here.	1
Everything has already been said about the iPhone X. I love it myself, because it goes back in the handy direction, in terms of size. Apple from its coolest side :) Since the iPhone 5SE I order my cell phones without exception at A-Montain & has never been disappointed: Top shipping, original goods, original packaging .. Absolute Satisfaction Guarantee! Thank you very much for that :)	1
To make my review here really useful, I write from my special experience as a former iPhone 6s user who now uses the iPhone X. I go into the advantages that the X has compared to the 6s, in which areas you can see no difference or for what reasons a change is worthwhile or not worthwhile.Old model: iPhone 6s, 64 GBNew model: iPhone X, 64 GB ** Screen size or mobile size ** The iPhone X has a slightly larger screen. What strikes immediately is the larger font size. This is a bit uncomfortable at first, but lays relatively fast. When I took my iPhone 6s after a few days in the hand, the font and screen size seemed too small. Although the size was not a change reason, I would now also advise to change. ** Face ID vs.. Fingerprint ** Sure, it's cool that the iPhone X offers facial recognition. However, the changeover is still hard for me. I noticed that in the past I often had the iPhone 6s on the table, and could easily unlock with my fingerprint. Because of the Face ID, I have to pick up the iPhone X or bend over the phone so I can unlock it. That was much easier in the past. The Face ID works just as reliable as the fingerprint that I would wish for. Here was the iPhone 6s better or more pleasant. ** Speed ​​** I can make that short: The iPhone 6s was always super fast and I had no problems with it. Even after 3 years in continuous use, there was no reason to moan. There are no noticeable differences between 6s and X. ** Battery life ** Again, there is no big difference. Despite the larger screen, I have the feeling that I need to load the iPhone X a little less, so that the battery life is a bit longer. ** Camera or photos / videos ** One wonders with each change, whether the camera really can get even better. The photos and videos at 6s were really great. Nevertheless, I naturally hoped that the difference is noticeable or visible. This hope was fulfilled once again. The camera with all the known additional features is an absolute reason to switch. ** Memory ** I have chosen the 64GB version, since the 64GB iPhone 6s were absolutely sufficient. Despite a lot of photos, videos, games and other apps, including a gigantic Whatsapp database, I never got to the limit. That's why I chose the smaller version this time. I hope I will not regret this choice in 1-2 years, but so far I'm confident and happy to have saved a bit of money. ** CONCLUSION ** Switching from iPhone 6s to iPhone X makes sense. Nicer photos, a better and larger display, and some new features that may be better used in the future (such as facial recognition or the frameless screen). If you change, you should ask yourself when choosing the memory, whether in the past with 64GB more frequently became scarce or not. Thank you for reading and hopefully have fun with the iPhone X.	1
What should I write great? ... Smartphone as expected top! Super fast delivery, even before the given delivery date. Can you recommend without hesitation.	1
I have only been using iPhones for several years, most recently I had the 6S. I have always been very satisfied, updates come regularly and over several years, the operating system is very stable and the whole Apple universe very well thought out and coordinated. Of course you pay more than for an Android phone, but you have much more for your money mMn. Also, the iPhone X is a great device, I got it as part of a contract extension. I usually have at least 60% battery in the evening, despite massive Daddelns, I had that on any cell phone. The performance is great, Face ID works well despite initial concerns, even if Touch ID is sometimes cheaper, especially if the device is on the table. Reception is also good, which was sometimes not so optimal with earlier iPhones. And it has the perfect size for me, a large display with still handy dimensions. I do not regret anything here, only that I would like to operate the X without a shell, but I'm still too big a bowl ...	1
Without a hint of doubt, the iPhone X is the very best phone I've ever owned. My personal highlights: FaceID works perfectly, the display is fantastic, the size perfect and the camera with optical zoom and image stabilization bombastic. But there are also many small details that make using it more fun. The quality of the workmanship is great, which makes the phone very easy to hold, the speakers are not great for the size they are taking, and the TapticEngine (the vibration motor) in combination with 3D Touch make you feel like real buttons also the battery is better than the previous generation, a day is synonymous with absolute continuous use no problem, at least I still charge it every night, which, thanks to wireless charging anyway no effort ist.Zum price is said: Yes, it is incredibly expensive. Just a few years ago nobody would have been willing to spend over € 1,000 on a cell phone. Many people probably still think so today. But some crazy people are actually willing, like me, to invest this money. And it was really worth it for me personally. I use my phone every day for several hours and I want to be confused with hanging apps, a bad camera and security problems caused by missing updates or face recognition that can be tricked by a photo. For that I also like to spend more money. If you also maintain the cell phone well and sell it in one or two years at a reasonable price, the effective cost eh "only" to one to a maximum of two euros per day. Since I prefer to drink a coffee less and buy me a reasonable phone.	1
Best iPhone ever. Am thrilled. The display is awesome. I like to find it heavier and more valuable	1
Have received the Iphone X today and am totally excited about the speed of the device! Had before the Iphone 6 and after the last updates of ios 11 you noticed a few jerks what annoys me personally just annoying. Touch ID was great, I would like that in the Iphone x but well of Face ID I'll get used to quickly, so far, it works great even in the dark! Camera is in contrast to the Iphone 6 a quantum leap, in low light conditions, it was still great pictures without too much to rush! I'm completely satisfied! You do not need to talk about the price, but the part will be up and running in 5 years' time, it has a lot of potential for things that are still in its infancy (AR etc). Do not trust the reviews from the people who still use the thing Never had in hand and blaspheme here, as it is in life, but everyone must know whether he spends so much money for a cell phone or not, there are other cell phones from other manufacturers cost around 1000 ¬ but just the Iphone you always have the feeling you have to justify yourself! A pity, well	1
Pro portait mode still very mixed (especially on the front camera) - Elimination of TouchID (where FaceID surprised me very positively) Short to me, I already had countless smartphones including the iPhone 4s, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, Samsung Note 2 , Nexus 6P, Galaxy S7 and an Asus Zenfone AR. Specifically, the standby times for the iPhone 6 Plus, but also the battery life in use have set standards for me, since I was never satisfied. The iPhone X has very similar battery life I have so far - I come to about 1 hour use per 10% battery loss. So about 10 hours in total. That's almost the value that my 6 Plus has done and of which I was really positively surprised. Unfortunately, the size of the Plus models was a bit too big for me. The 4.7 "" model, on the other hand, was always minimally too small for the outside dimensions, as well as the edge especially above and below the display, which I already have with the iPhone 3G criticized and which even pulls up to the iPhone 8 from 2017 through. So for me three clear reasons that speak for the iPhone X. It is still very handy similar to the 4.7 "" iPhones, but has a larger display and a battery life comparable to the Plus models, if not even minimal over it. **** Processing **** The mobile phone is Super processed what I expect for the price but definitely. But it also feels relatively difficult. It's about as heavy as my old 6 Plus according to the gram numbers, but probably feels harder because of the more compact design, because you just suspect less weight in size. But for me that is rather positive, as long as I know that the weight comes from high quality materials. **** Operation, FaceID, Homebutton (gesture) **** The omission of the Homebuttons was a big doubt for me before the purchase , I was still annoyed by TouchID in the iPhone 6 Plus because it was slow and often did not work, I've learned to love it since my iPhone 6S. It was fast and reliable. Since the home button on the iPhone X has been removed, now the possibility TouchID on the back or in the power button to bring under. However, Apple seems to be very sure FaceID and completely dispense with it. My concerns regarding FaceID were specifically how quickly does it recognize me, I have a much higher error rate than TouchID and it takes significantly longer to unlock the iPhone effectively, it works in absolute darkness? Now after 10 days I can say that FaceID surprised me more than positively. For one thing, you really need absolutely no light because the front camera is not used at all, only the infrared sensors, which do not need light. I've even covered the camera extra - absolutely no concerns. The error rate of FaceID is also quite low. I do not have any empirical data on that, but it feels that I have a hand on my face that is almost flawless and probably even better than TouchID. What caused me a headache in the run-up was to replace the simplicity of the Homebutton with a gesture. I think everyone knows how often it did not work to wipe up the control center from below. Now the Homebutton gesture works really much better and above all, really intuitive, since the first time wiping you got the hang of it. I often catch myself picking up the old iPhone, trying to swipe up there. All in all, I really like the implementation very well, especially with regard to the new design with the entire display front.There is simply no room for a homebutton and as it was implemented, it is really good, and space-saving. **** Camera / s **** First of all, the main camera. This makes really good pictures and captures in comparison to my 6s especially in the dark much more light. Otherwise the dynamics are really good. Here, however, the Pixel 2 seems to have the nose in front. What I do not like so much is the portrait mode. If it works, you get a nice picture, but in my eyes there are too many situations where either the background is not really pixelated. In addition, the edges are often still very dirty, so that the background or the object in the foreground on the contour is slightly pixelated. All in all, I'm very happy with the camera, but I would still want improvements in portrait mode. The front camera even makes very good pictures. With the iPhone X you can also shoot portrait photos with the front camera. The feature is currently still in beta and you can tell that very clearly. The face often looks like covered with a very strong blur and also the problem of the main camera on the contour often the background is not pixelated, or the object is pixelated in the foreground. The differences to the Google Pixel 2 are here really worlds. Also here I hope that Apple put a lot of work in. **** Conclusion **** I can understand anyone who says that the iPhone X is too expensive, because I personally regret that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus design technically got so little. The iPhone has been to iPhone 3G times as far as the edges are just too much and one of my major criticisms and even if they have minimized (I think) 5s minimally, it was always clear to me too much edge. The Apple now this year brings out an iPhone which feels really modern and then still presented two devices according to the old design is a bit unfavorable in my eyes and not what Apple once had as a philosophy - 1 device that is "perfect" , Well, they have not quite complied with the jump to the 4.7 "" and 5.5 ", because the big one had the better camera. Apart from that and the place larger battery, but they were almost the same. The X, however, is really another house number. A more expensive stainless steel frame compared to aluminum. Better display in terms of resolution and technology - even if the Notch is not necessarily perfect. A camera that is even better than the Plus model (both lenses have an image stabilizer on the plus model, only the 1x camera) and the front camera is better and supports FaceID. I've got it despite the price, since I've been for myself after the iPhone 4s on the Galaxy Note 2 changed a mobile phone in 5 "" format had wished, at the former display edges. Although the iPhone X has 5.8 "" absolutely, minus the Notch and because it is now a borderless display, it has pretty much the size that I think is optimal. In addition, the battery is very important to me and I was really satisfied with any android, even if I had devices that had a larger than average battery (Note 2 and Nexus 6P) .For me, the iPhone X is therefore a really successful smartphone with a really good , although still need to be improved camera for a proud price.	1
Super Handy.Kamera is simply fabulousDisplay very bright and the picture quality is top. And all shades are beautifully presented. Mobile phone is also very fluid. Overall a great Handy.Wenn Apple likes then you do not go wrong	1
Have an iPhone that has ever been opened, all good. I am very satisfied with the condition of the product. Is really like new	1
Well well well	1
My son is very satisfied	1
I love it	1
Who wants an iPhone will not be disappointed.	1
For all who have the worry of spending so much money and not get a new smartphone ... Have ordered my iPhone 8 via Amazon at the seller A-Montain. Smartphone comes from Portugal, mine was intended according to packaging for Slovakia or the Czech Republic. That's not bad, you start the iPhone and everything is like a planned for Germany iPhone. Smartphone from the seller A-Montain comes in its original packaging and is brand new. Please always before buying the seller's opinions do not view the product !!! Product itself is very good! Of course delivery takes 4-5 days because the phone had a long way. Everything well packed and orderable without any worries. To the iPhone itself ... Smartphone from Apple as usual top processed, and very fast. Makes great photos. I switched from iPhone SE to 8. SE also great mobile phone, but the difference especially in photos and videos is enormous. Can the product and the seller recommend to anyone who wants to buy the iPhone 8. Kind regards	1
I was skeptical at first, because the iPhone is much cheaper than in the business. In addition, you have read the reviews of "fake". But I thought I try it anyway and have ordered it. I'm so surprised by positive! It is a completely new iPhone in original packaging. The packaging was sealed and the phone in a pristine condition. Just like you would buy it in the store for 800 € you get it here for 640 € Also the delivery was fast.	1
Ordered yesterday morning, arrived this morning! Everything perfect and in original packaging! The price is nothing to complain about	1
After a long search I am stuck with CVV, best reviews and I can confirm this. Item as described Iphone for the German market, fast and very well packaged delivery. Absolutely top.	1
Have now, after more than four years of use of my iPhone4s, persuaded to buy a new smartphone and I have remained brand loyal. Surprising for me was the relatively quick discount of just a year old iPhone 8. Hopefully I'm happy with it so long as with the previously used iPhone ;-)	1
Original commodity!	1
Have upgraded from iPhone 6 to iPhone 8 and I'm very happy Pros: + Better Camera (quality, light, faster pictures recording) + Loud Speaker + Better Microphone quality + Very fast processor + Battery charges very fast & lasts a long time (In my case , 100% load once a day is enough for all day social media & Youtube) Cons: - No "" normal "" headphone jack	1
Fast delivery, Apple original packaging everything great. Setup and commissioning without any problems, okay, this also has a professional in the house, but I think I would have done so well. I am particularly pleased about the battery performance, which was not really bad for my predecessor IPhone.	1
Had the iPhone 6s for a long time and decided after 2 1/2 years for a new phone and it has become the iPhone 8 and I am very excited about the phone. Both the battery power and the camera are very good. Also, Iduktive loading I find very convenient and use it gladly	1
My 2nd iphone after the 5s. Very good commissioning went off, just capture a whirling circle with the camera of the Althandys and already starts the setup of the new phone completely automatically and wirelessly. The prerequisite is, of course, that the old device has a backup in the iCloud. In between, enter the code and the Apple ID a few times. After an hour, everything is done, the latest IOS version is installed and the old phone completely cloned. The delivered Iphone 8 arrived intact as a new product with me. The bigger, but not too big screen, I like, as well as the larger storage space with 64 GB. That should be sufficient for me now. Otherwise, the smartphone works smoothly and quickly. I am happy.	1
For such a cheap price, finding an iPhone 8 is already close to a miracle.	1
Was a bit skeptical because the price was cheaper than elsewhere. But I just trusted the good reviews. And I was not disappointed. Super fast delivery, everything was great. Handy came in original packaging and works perfectly! The color is as beautiful as the phone itself. Thanks :)	1
The iPhone has come packed and original. Charging cable and headphones with it.	1
I do not need to report about the smartphone itself. As usual from Apple a top device. I ordered the device because of the low price for my mother. And everything worked perfectly. The smartphone arrived by "Sameday Delivery" in the late afternoon. It was original packed and in an absolute "" virgin state "". Everything worked, there were no problems. But I did not expect anything else.	1
As you know it from Apple, this model is also extremely good. The camera is really good and the battery power is extremely strong. Otherwise there is not much to say. Once Apple always Apple	1
Perfect for smaller hands. Great workmanship, but you can expect that at the price. The cellphone takes outstanding photos. Unfortunately, no portrait functions of the sister model iPhone X. Battery lasts at least the whole day. Display also at a high level. One of the best LCD I have ever seen. The color gold is a mixture of rose and gold. Sometimes remembering brass or copper. If you do not want or need a huge cell phone, you will find a compact high-end device here. The price is too high!	1
Super device, as always a bit more expensive, but super fast and easy from my iPhone 6 everything played on the 8 "over". Open iTunes and create a backup and import it to the new one. Takes no 20 minutes	1
As expected, of course, a top device, typically Apple. Everything works as it should. We still have nothing to complain about ;-)	1
Meets my expectations. Shipping quickly. Italian packaging. Works flawlessly	1
As always from Amazon, fast delivery. Iphone was originally welded. Cardboard lettering was i.a. in German.Seriennummer the order confirmation agreed with the supplied Iphone. Iphone was registered with Apple. Camera-Click can be deactivated, so no product for the Asian market. All good.	1
My first Apple smartphone and I love it. Quality, performance, design, here everything fits. Also the price. Especially I can emphasize the battery performance, the battery lasts for normal use a good 2 days. Unfortunately that was not the case with my Samsung ...	1
I just love this phone, fits my hand perfectly and does everything i want.The good thing was the expert in my local phone shop was easily able to trim my old Simm card to fit the iPhone 8, no charge, while I waited and even gave me a plastic holder if ever I needed to put the simm back into the 4s. Allowing trouble free change over from one phone to the other without having to change my contract.A great deal from Amazon,£50 cheaper than anywhere else with what turned out to be rapid and reliable delivery.	1
Since my old Iphone 5s has given up the ghost, I have been looking for a good successor with not too big display. Easy installation, great features.	1
I'm excited. Product is really new! And at this price. If it does not matter which country the iPhone comes from, this is the perfect way to get a "cheap" iPhone.	1
What should I expect there is an Apple product with the appropriate quality - Orginal Packed as in the Apple Store.As prime customer delivery within a working day, what more could you want.	1
For the price a good investment! From Amazon, a quick delivery and then get started with the set up. I switched from Android to iPhone and I'm excited about the product.	1
You get an iPhone for a bomb-priced here. The delivery was done in the usual fast manner and as promised, this is an Oroginal product. Full Lieferunfang- round perfect.	1

A preliminary - Actually, the iphone 8 is an iphone 7s. Compared to its predecessor falls in the EVERYDAY: Slightly faster performance The photos made by the phone are a little warmer (the colors do not look as pale as the 7). It is noticeably heavier than that iphone 7 - which is for me a disadvantage. In my opinion, it is better Processed than its predecessor (buttons can be more pleasant press etc. = general better feel) The speakers are louder and have a richer sound (very good for a cell phone). Battery: if the phone is not in continuous use (sometimes checking whats app, taking a few pictures, surfing the internet, instagramm ...) the battery is enough for 1 day. I have to go to bed most of the time about 30% battery capacity left. However, I have to say that I use the phone neither to play nor to excessive video consumption. Tip from me: if you already own an iphone 7, the benefits of an iphone 8 are too low d However, if you would like to upgrade from an older model (iphone 6s / SE or older) to a new one, I would recommend buying an iphone 8 directly because the price difference compared to the 7 is not serious. What the seller (A-Mountain): I have checked the serial number on the apple homepage and it is indeed a new device with full warranty. So everything is fine! Unfortunately, I can not answer you as the cheaper price comes. But probably everyone will care as long as the product itself is okay (with full apple warranty + new). I hope I could help you with your purchase decision something.	1
super quality of the iphone 8, battery lasts 2 days approx is super with pocket in drr hand, I can only recommend!	1
Hi, I also decided to buy an Apple product. How that came, I can not say. In any case here my review to the Iphone came with Prime quickly and easily. Packed in the Amazon package, everything looked normal and commercially - it was. Included in the box is the Iphone, charging cable, power adapter, headphones, AUX adapters and descriptions in all languages. Functionality: I think to Apple products I need not tell anything here. Everything runs super fluently, thanks to IOS 11. The camera on the phone is amazing and the fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. Overall, it was personally unusual for me to hold an IOS device in my hand, because I had been running Android devices. In a direct comparison, the Iphone seems to run smoother compared to my previous devices. The battery life is unfortunately not that convincing. Conclusion Apple products are really great, work flawlessly, have great specifications and details. Unfortunately, the brand can pay well. Nevertheless, a really good smartphone!	1
I ordered the iPhone 8, because my iPhone SE was a little too small. With AMAZON PRIME as usual delivered in next to no time the next day. Packed, furnished and look forward to a smartphone, which shines with extraordinary quality and design. About the design can be a lot of discussion, since it is known from the iPhone 6 from the year 2014. However, for anyone who does not want to give up the home button including the very fast Touch ID, the iPhone 8/8 Plus is the perfect solution. Also, you do not have to do without performance here, because the iPhone 8/8 Plus is currently, next to the iPhone X, the most powerful smartphone, which is currently available. Videos in 4K (60fps) are with this smartphone, the absolute insanity. Very smooth playback and true color images are easily possible with the Apple phone. Processing is Apple-typical on a level, which is unparalleled sucht.Und Amazon.de can only say: TOP price! 699 € for the iPhone 8 are unbeatable at the current time. From a reputable provider to get such a price, absolutely great. Next so dear Amazon team -------------------- Experience report after three weeks of use: The iPhone 8 is very much Liquid with iOS 11.Bislang no grounds for complaint with my device. Everything works perfectly. The battery life was initially a bit short, but has made after several charges an improvement in battery life noticeable. I come with the relatively "small" battery easily through a full day with normal use (WhatsApp, Facebook, e-mail, Internet). But if you expect an excessively long battery life, I would be better served with the iPhone 8 Plus. A11 Bionic - That's the built-in processor of the iPhone 8th Games run without jerking and require the A11 chip only a fraction of the possible ab.Der Virtual Homebutton was unusual in the beginning, as I have previously used the iPhone SE with conventional Homebutton. After the three-week use, but I can say now, you miss nothing. On the contrary, a pushable home button does not look contemporary anymore. The interaction of the Taptic engine with the homebutton conveys a very high-quality click feeling which emphasizes the quality again positively. Camera - The camera is definitely one of the best that one can have in a smartphone. Razor-sharp images are no problem thanks to the optical image stabilization. The color-true videos are a clear advantage of the iPhone 8. Processing - Nothing creaks, everything perfect! The glass back looks very noble and gives the iPhone more grip compared to the aluminum housing of the iPhone 7 or iPhone SE. It is safe in the hand without having to fear that it will slide out of your hand at any moment. Since I myself use a sleeve of SPIGEN to optimally protect my iPhone, the grip is even better. Contra: The glass back is very vulnerable for fingerprints! Conclusion: Successful smartphone from the House of Apple, which despite the already known since the iPhone 6 (2014) design is not really recognizable at first glance. The Apple specifically developed iOS runs perfectly. All in all you get a high-end smartphone in a proven design with excellent quality in software, processing and Materialauswahl.Preis / performance is justified, since you get at least 4 years and longer Apple full support in the form of software updates	1
I write this review because here again and again people are upset that the product comes with foreign packaging or papers. I myself have ordered from the vendor A-Montain an iPhone and actually received a Slovak model. I then had the IMEI checked at Apple and it was a completely new device. I signed it in and my warranty is one year according to Apple. I just want to say that all iPhone models are produced in China and therefore do not differ in quality. However, since the price varies from country to country, it is not surprising that if you want a cheap iPhone would like this from a non-German speaking country. I'm quite happy with the device. I've been using an iPhone 5s for over four and a half years now, and since it had some signs of aging, it was time to switch. I can only recommend the iPhone8.	1
Ships from France. Seller name 630, - (no shipping fees) Box in plastic shrink wrapped. Languages ​​on box: FR, DE, NLArticle code: MQ6H2ZD / Accessories is complete: charging plugs, cables, earphones, jacks <> Lightning AdapterNo SIM LockHandy sees absolutely new, it is certainly synonymous! (The whole protection films were on it too) Registration for Apple Care: no problem! (You have to wait until the next day after the first power up) TOP PRICE !!	1
Was skeptical at first because of a few reviews and then I also thought about canceling the order. BUT everything was fine! Shipping from France, serial number checked and Apple Care insurance completed without problems - device runs great, no damage of packaging etc. Super price! Would order it again anytime - you save a lot of money!	1
At first I had to consider ordering a mobile phone on Amazon because of the price and the fact. Was pleasantly surprised, delivery was without problems and arrived as planned. The device is impeccable and it was still originalverpackungs.Ist recommended.	1
The iPhone was new and welded. Works flawlessly. Got this online for a very reasonable price. Offline, I would have had to pay about 250 euros. The only drawback - the delivery postman just put the phone down in the stairwell. That is not how it works. Not with such an expensive product.	1
Also I was very skeptical because of the enormously cheaper price, but the mostly very positive reviews encouraged me to buy. Rightly! The product is a flawless and brand new iPhone 8 64GB in the color gold. The shipment was from Spain and the product was completely original packed. All protective films were still attached and all included products (Lightning cable, plug, headphones, manual) were included. Also, the IMEI review revealed that it is a new and original iPhone. Unfortunately, I am not the greatest technology guru, I prefer not to lose the technical data. Since other reviews have very aptly put it in a nutshell anyway. I'm overjoyed to have come across this offer!	1
Delivery as Apple itself, perfectly packed, timely. Despite all concerns some joy, the cheaper price must have a reason, I was able to unpack a brand new iPhone 8, which could be synchronized easily and already has all the data plus apps on my iPhone 6 is running. Everything is great, can only recommend this way - get great product, quite a bit of what saved, I would do it again	1
The Iphone 8 is very good in the hand and visually looks very good. Through the glass back it is much more comfortable in the hand than, for example, the iphone 6. Technically, I could now recognize no serious differences to the Iphone 6. The only "" problem "" is still the camera with the Iphones - there are other manufacturers, some light years ahead of the quality of the pictures.	1
I was very skeptical at first, but I dared to buy it and am now very happy to have chosen this 'used' product. There was absolutely nothing wrong with that. "" Like new "" was definitely not over the top!	1
At first thought that this is fake. However, I got a nail nail new IPhone 8 and I am very satisfied with it, would buy it again at any time, at this price.	1
Good as it is	1
Honestly bissl but our concerns .. a new phone for the price on the Internet? Because of the good experience with Amazon but ultimately decided to try. Mobile phone was also delivered super fast with standard delivery. Brand new, according to description from Eastern Europe. We are very satisfied and can only recommend it.	1
I'm absolutely happy with this smartphone :)	1
I ordered the iPhone on Sunday and received it on Tuesday morning (despite standard shipping). The purchase is now half a year ago and the iPhone is still working properly. I can only recommend!	1
Have the iPhone 8 with 64GB to my contract extension and not bought from Amazon. Am with the iPhone (very satisfied and that for about 14 months). The smartphone looks really great, because you do not want to make a protective cover, but unfortunately you have to use the mobile phones nowadays. The screens are getting rounder and very many manufacturers have the screen glass, unfortunately, small curves on the edges, which makes the screen very unstable. This forces an almost to the manufacturer's own insurance, which are not cheap or you get such a glass break insurance, who wants to play it safe. My IPhone 8 has fallen down once and the screen is broken despite the seal, sleeve and screen protector. Called the Apple service immediately and the phone was picked up the next day and it was repaired 3 days later. Do you have to say great and fast service and I already knew how expensive the repair is, that is not the case with other manufacturers. The screen brightness and sharpness is very good, a very clear picture. Fortunately, they have increased memory, which is also necessary because the operating system is already quite large. The hardware is great on the operating system tuned that you have to leave Apple. This keeps the battery very long. Even if I play a lot of videos and games or do something else during the day, the battery lasts all day. The camera is very good for me, there are many little gimmicks, I like it. The picture stabilizes very fast and the pictures are really great. Speakers are alright, I think a cell phone with super speakers does not exist, but the devices are too small and I need not synonymous. I like the iPhone 8 very well and I would buy it again and again. To the newer IPhones I can not say so much, only that the screens should be very unstable. I hope you have helped this review.	1
The price performance ratio is great and I am thrilled. The device works einbanfrei and I'm glad to have bought this IPhone.	1
The phone is made for Germany but delivered from France. It has never been activated and contrary to some nonsense here is a genuine original iPhone with original accessories. And in complete. No idea what others have. Shipping was very fast. Thanks.	1
Very nice mobile. Who is an Apple fan has definitely not done anything wrong! The only drawback is the price but you can overlook it	1
Is an iPhone ... since i phone 5 has not changed much since there	1
What should one write ... it's just an iPhone you love it or ... you can not order one ... delivery quickly and easily, according to my impression new and original wrapped goods. Everything super so far!	1
Perfect	1
iPhone fits - Has arrived in our original locked.	1
IPhone 8 has everything a modern smartphone needs. Display is great. All apps are stable. The battery lasts forever.	1
The phone is superVoll new and OrginalSehr satisfied and I recommend it on Fast shipping and good quality	1
Had something jumble when ordering that the goods could be fake. But was delivered an original iPhone 8 with all accessories. So far I can not complain and am pleased with the new device. :)	1
Product received in perfect condition.	1
Top!	1
I have to say that it is a normal iPhone and everything went well	1
Very nice experience.	1
As usual - very good quality	1
The climb from Android to Apple has been worthwhile in any case. The smartphone does not come against the powerful battery of my OnePlus 3T ran, but is otherwise very good in all respects. The processing and in general I like the look and feel better than with all previous Android models	1
Everything great!!!	1
The product has been delivered to your home in its original packaging, but the seller has not responded to my request to send the product as soon as possible. 1 week has taken the delivery. I did not check the serial number but somewhere I saw a label that was in a foreign language (Italian or Romanian?), Which does not bother me. The warranty I have checked and the warranty began to run only with the activation. Since the price was cheaper than in retail, I am satisfied, all Apple products are the same, no matter from which country you purchase them.	1
At first, I was skeptical that the iPhone is really original Apple. Yes, that's it! I have checked the imei number at Apple and it has not yet been activated. Furthermore, it was still sealed in the plastic film and everything was included with accessories. My iPhone was shipped from Spain. (White / silver) where apparently every color is shipped from another country, that is another dealer. The product name with zd / a has also agreed. An iPhone that was apparently intended for the German market. Fast delivery and value for money also fits. I can only recommend if you want to have an iPhone 8.	1
At first I had no idea which rating I should write here .. but again from the beginning .. In September I ordered my IPhone 8, 64GB in gold, after I read all the great reviews. Also important were the delivery times. Everything was shipped with UPS. Initial difficulties on the part of UPS, I still took in the hope to soon hold my IPhone in the hands. UPS let celebrate and on a Monday my package should be delivered. Since I was not home, the re-delivery should be one day later. I immediately called the toll-free hotline and wanted to make an appointment. 2 pm I'm still working. UPS informed me that there is a kiosk nearby where I could pick up my package. Great, I thought and am on the following day immediately after work: closed. The kiosk was open all week even though the opening times said something different. Through the windows I could see my package lying on the ground .. the iPhone so close and yet so far, I called again against charges at UPS. These could not help with. Finally, I was able to establish contact with Amazon and the dealer Eutronics_Germania. Through many phone calls and a really hard-working boss I did not feel left alone. Nevertheless, in the end, I had to go to the police to file an embezzlement complaint so I could get a new IPhone. UPS informed me meanwhile that I should pick up the package in the shop. Hours: closed all day. Such Witzbolde.Am end, everything went well: via DHL, my IPhone arrived within a short time and I could test it now for a week. Overall, I think it's very good. The quality of Apple is great and the service is impeccable. And since I already had an old IPhone SE, the synchronization worked without problems and I was able to telephone, write and research in the usual way. Overall I am very satisfied with the iPhone so far and the customer service of Eutronics_Germania is top. For UPS I would like to give a different rating. That would be beyond the scope here.	1
We bought a mobile phone from TBE and are very satisfied with the iPhone 8 and the ordering process. Everything in perfect order.	1
After 2 years of Android, I returned to the tried and tested Apple camp. The iPhone 8 is a top smartphone, both visually and functionally. I have not regretted it for a minute, and android is far from iOS in my opinion. (Speed, stability, safety) That justifies the surcharge for me. Especially since I get again 4-5 years updates.	1
I have bought the iPhone as a successor to my previous iPhone 6 and am very satisfied with it. The device is very fast and runs very well. Buy recommendation, since the price was very attractive!	1
Fast, lots of storage, nice design ... I'm very satisfied. Clear buy recommendation, if you need a current smartphone and do not like full-screen touch displays.	1
I'm skeptical at first. But then I like to use the device. There is no fake device from iPhone and 8 is new device so I do not think so far that the device is old and again ...	1
So this is my first new IPhone I as a boy have it in gold #nohomo but still find it a nice color and now the Iphone itself up on the battery, there is nothing to complain about the phone is fast and compact what more could you want Battery had just a little bit stuck back, but if you are not permanent YouTube or durable on the phone is easy to get through the day I can give a very easy buy recommendation and I'm really very satisfied	1
I personally bought the iPhone8 Space Gray. As a small savings joke I have had my iPhone 5 for 5 years so that means it was time to upgrade :-) Through my job I had and still have contact with younger iPhones and also to many different Samsung smartphones, where I for various company-specific facilities and bug fixes are in charge .------------------------------------------ --------------- Here is my personal review of the iPhone 8 64GB space grayI will always put down small tips / tricks at the bottom, which may be helpful for some. -------------------------------------------------- ------ DIMENSIONS / DESIGN ----- The iPhone 8 has the dimensions H: 138.4 W: 67.3 D: 7.3 mm and is 148g heavy. The size is thus minimal different than the iPhone 7, which is not recognizable. It fit case and protective glasses from its predecessor. For me, the size was the reason to buy. With too big smartphones, I can not do anything and the iPhone 8 is here at my upper limit. Ideal would have been natural if Apple also here (almost) borderless display installs. But what is not can still be in the next few years. Compared to the predecessor, the Iphone 7 was hardly changed here. The back is made of glass looks really classy. Unfortunately, this does not use anything, since a case is used anyway. Otherwise, the pages are still rounded off so the phone is very comfortable in the hand. The camera on the back stands out slightly. This is definitely an important disadvantage for those who want to use the device without a case. It suits me, however. The colors are a matter of taste, but for me only space gray came into question. Looks incredibly noble and I like it very well .----- DISPLAY ----- The display is 4.7 "" and has a resolution of 750 x 1,334 pixels. Thus, the pixel density at 326ppi and a lot less than the PLUS model and also smaller than most competitors. Nevertheless, the picture is extremely sharp and the worse value is not recognizable even for me. In direct comparison with the Samsung Galaxy S8, I only realize that the Galaxy S8 is much stronger colors. This looks better, of course, but the iPhone 8 display looks more natural.----- PROCESSOR / SPEED ----- That's the absolute strength of the iPhone. Here one is ahead of the competition for a long time. That's why I was able to use my old iPhone 5 for a full 5 years without restriction. The iPhone 8 uses the new A11 Bionic chip and it is sensational. There are no waiting times :-) In my comparison to the Galaxy S8, the difference is clearly visible. Opening apps and editing photos is ultra-fast, so Apple is one step ahead. The IOS 11 operating system, as always, is ultra-fast and easy to use. The great thing is that everything comes from one provider and is 100% compatible. - CAMERA ----- The camera has a resolution of 12.2 megapixels. That's enough for pretty much all users anyway, everything about it would be nonsense. Not much has changed compared to the predecessor, the photosensor is bigger and due to the fast chip movement and so on should be easier to handle. These are such small details. I think the cam was already first cream and it is now again. With previous use, I was completely thrilled by the photos. The great change, however, there is the video quality. 4K with 60 frames per second. Awesome :-) The slow motion videos as synonymous with HD quality. I have already done both outdoors and in bad light photos and I'm thrilled :-) The front camera is with 8.3 megapixels quite solid. Here you can see the quality difference to the rear but clearly. Nevertheless, a great front camera ----- BATTERY ----- About the battery, I can write something difficult so far. Depending on usage, the battery life varies greatly. Of course you will never get by a full day at full operation, for me the duration is satisfactory. Okay, now Apple has finally managed that their devices can also be wirelessly loaded by QI standard. This works great, and is eg.very comfortable with me in the workplace .----- COMPARED TO SAMSUNG GALAXY S8 ----- My brother has recently launched the Samsung Galaxy S8. I'm equally excited about its device and wanted to test / compare some things. First I have to say that the Galaxy S8 is larger. And especially at the height. The Galaxy S8 is longer than 1 cm. Otherwise, they are close to the same size. The S8 has much more display relative to the case. (4.7 "" to 5.8 ""). Visually, videos look better on the Galaxy. Stronger colors, shinier, looks awfully great, but maybe they're more genuine and natural on the iPhone. The speed is just as great, yet iPhone 8 is the clear No.1. Samsung has to work with Android, which has many cool features but does not make it perfect. Both are wirelessly rechargeable with QI technology. Camera wise, the two do not take much. Likewise with bad Lichverhältnisse. I like both. With the expandability / connectivity the Samsung is clearly in the advantage. The Galaxy S8 you can use a memory card - the iPhone is not yet what annoys me personally very annoying. The transfer of music, pictures, etc. is also very easy with the Samsung.Weiter speaks also of course the price for Samsung.PRO iPhone 8- extremely fast- hardware and software from a single source, perfect interaction- handy- Siri unbeatablePRO Galaxy S8- large Display / housing ratio extreme display brightness memory expandability good connectivity with other systems ----- CONCLUSION ----- I'm absolutely thrilled with the iPhone 8 and I'm glad to have spent the 799 ¬. But it should also hold like my old again a few years :-) An upgrade from the iPhone 7 on the iPhone 8 I think rather not necessary. The changes are not so big, there would probably be a switch to the iPhone X to consider.I can recommend the iPhone 8 to 100%. Except for a few nasty little things that have always been with Apple is a sensational smartphone. I've recently read a pro test, which has come out that it's the best smartphone yet, but at the same time the most boring: -) ----- TIPS ----- PRICEI would have preferred to buy here, but it was not available. It may take a bit longer to get there. So I bought it directly from Apple. In any case, the iPhone 8 64GB may not be more expensive than € 799, which is the list price and you get it normally everywhere. Everything that looks very cheap here I would do some research and investigate the dealer. Apple has its own pricing policy and would like to offer everyone the same price. Therefore, caution should always be exercised at special prices.3D TouchGibts has been around Apple for some time, but some new users may not know it. Example: A normal click on the app icon will get you into this app. Through a 3D touch (strong click) on the camera icon to get to the quick access of various actions of this app. Just try it :-) BLUETOOTH / WLANWer battery saving would like to be said, switching off Bluetooth or WLAN in the control center means only a temporary interrupt. It is completely deactivated only in the settings.CONTROL CENTERWith a wipe from the lower edge to the top you get as usual in the control center. This can finally be adjusted in the Settings / Control Center FINALLY. PHOTO SEARCH really cool and I like it very much. After opening the app photos there is indeed the search function. Here I just enter the keyword of the photo such as. Water or sport. IOS recognizes the pictures partially and assigns them keywords :-) Works quite well.SIRIViele my friends know you but use but hardly anyone. That's a matter of habit. But Siri just works great. Sometimes I do not need to pick up the iPhone to make calls, write messages or make various searches.	1
A MUST for this hammer price! It is an original, new and original packed! I'm glad to have ordered it! iPhone Tip Top! And seller also Tip Top!	1
At first had concerns about the low price, but everything is original and works flawlessly. Was also very fast there and in original packaging etc. Very satisfied!	1
Very well! It was delivered quickly and the product is flawless. The color is very nice (goes a bit to the rose).	1
Here is to read that some are afraid if the iPhone is new or even original. The phone came in original packaging and the packaging was typically wrapped in foil. Definitely all right and new. Also inside everything as normal as from the store. No difference. The IMEI number also confirms that the mobile has never been used. Every time again, the price is great.	1
I have bought the iPhone 8 as a successor to my previous iPhone 6. So far, I'm very satisfied, will probably not change it;). What can I say, it runs much faster than my old, but for other reasons. I can only recommend it.	1
Has met exactly my expectations. Significantly cheaper than the iPhone X but, apart from the size of the display, for the normal end consumer like me at least as good.	1
I am very happy with my iPhone. Of course, costs a lot of money, but in my opinion, its worth the money. So buy!	1
The customer service of Eutronics Germania is the best we have ever had so far. Response within 0.5h and always ready for a solution. There are 5 stars "thumbs up".	1
but it was acquired as an update to 6s. The device can be seen as a logical continuation of a product line ... Lack of innovation? By no means, rather, continuity and understatement. Against the X has spoken for me missing Touch ID. I do not want a Face ID at the moment because I want to unlock the phone at any time without contact to the face. The processor is the same as in the X and in contrast to the 6s, Siri responds, for example. extremely fast, the rest was synonymous with 6s liquid. The camera is absolutely perfect and make even low light extremely good pictures, at least for my claims absolutely sufficient. Language quality has definitely got better and the stereo sound can be seen and are perfect update to the 6th. The device is "" waterproof "" ... nice addition ... There is no real innovation in any device, if you look at gadgets like borderless displays, as an innovation ... especially if a device falls. I would definitely buy the device again !	1
Delivery worked great and everything in top condition. It was in its original packaging and without any damage or anything else. I had my doubts so a cell phone over the Internet to order, but everything worked well. The delivery was also a charging cable, headphones and an adapter for Köpfhörer or AUX cable, everything works fine.	1
The product unfortunately came in the wrong color. The right one was already sent before I had brought the wrong color to the post office. In addition, I was always answered relatively quickly and also guaranteed a non-negligible discount. However, the emails were sometimes difficult to understand.	1
I was a little confused at the beginning, since the iPhone was sold here much cheaper (675 €), as for example in the media market (799 €). But it is undoubtedly an original iPhone from Apple.Apple itself offers for the phone 1 year manufacturer's warranty. The IMEI can be found on the SIM card of the phone, if you enter this on the side of Apple, you get the confirmation that it is an original iPhone. Therefore there is no reason to worry:) The delivery went quickly and without defects. Included in the package were headphones (not the Bluetooth headset), an adapter to connect the headphones on the phone and a charging cable. The back of the IPhone (in gold) is not real gold, but rather a rose gold, which I personally like even better technical details to the iPhone I write now nothing, because you can google this easy:) Conclusion: Super great mobile phone, fast problem-free delivery, original goods (!!), no need to worry.	1
My wife will be happy. !! .. with estimated delivery between 12.12.'18 - 14.12, ordered on 04.12, delivered on 07.12 ... Welded and brand new !! to see happy eyes at Christmas is always the most beautiful .. ,	1
I have replaced my good 2 year old 6s with it and am thrilled. I needed it but bought quasi new / unused for 650 euros here on Amazon and must say: Super fast and with much better battery performance than the 6s. So you can also calmly with 25% charge again go to the fresh (cold) air to run for an hour with GPS App while listening to music (AirPods) and is then still with 18% there. (Fresh example from today). Since the 6s would be already 3x greased. Conclusion: Really good price / performance ratio and clear purchase recommendation.	1
I bought my mobile phone at TBE international I was skeptical but on tbe international you can rely on Original ware everything super fast delivery and would buy it again	1
A very excellent device for the price performance of a very smooth and fast response device does not complain about anything	1
How good the iPhone 8 really is must first be seen. My 6S broke away after two years. Display is cloudy and the touch function is synonymous nicht.Ich can only rate the service of the supplier (CW Mobile). Everything went very smoothly. The device would even be delivered two days earlier than announced. Thank you very much	1
As always on time delivery via Amazon. The price / performance ratio of shoppingheaven motivated me to buy the iPhone 8. I am very satisfied with my purchase decision, the smartphone has fully met my expectations, gladly again.	1
Everything went really fast.	1
Great service, the Iphone was already there after two days. I am thrilled and for the low price. Many Thanks.	1
It's tiring and can be very expensive to periodically search for the even better smartphone ... Well, now I've done it to buy this iPhone 8. Since, as we know, there are no bad smartphones these days, It could also have been another part. Now it is, and it should stay in use for at least four years. And of course a word about this cell phone: Great! Otherwise, I wish all the joy with which phone.	1
Top!	1
I'm writing here on the iPhone 8 and I love it. I have previously used only Android: Sony, Huawei, Samsung After what did not quite 2 days for all features needed I am now completely in it and excited. IOS is indeed rigid and not great customizable, but it does not bother me a bit. Because everything is clean, coordinated, the phone runs like no other. Apps are open in seconds. Camera is top and also by many as the best smartphone camera ever awarded has a tremor like me but then you hate eh any camera whether big in DSLR or small in the smartphone. (Oh yes, please do not make the mistake to compare the photos of smartphones on the display but take NEN Calculator and puts them across, please thank you) Oh and the AppStore what did I hate it on Android .. vollgemüllt with cheap software that does not need anything synonymous leads to the fact that you can not find anything and with bad luck NEN Vi rus includes because nothing is properly checked. iOS makes it really reasonable software which one also finds that although good and likes money costs but ne reasonable implementation and menu guidance includes. By the way, I'm a fan of the design the glass feels from the feel of valent and makes the device even a piece heavier which I feel for me as a very pleasant. Muffo for some of the battery for me rather ... where is the problem? He keeps 1-1 / 2 days and I edit in the meantime pictures, games and surf in general pretty much. The thick frame, well, but maybe also especially now where the X out is the last in this form. The inner life is definitely the next 2 Muko for some battery or that the image from the display is displayed to neutral and not Samsung Oled style the controls up to stop aufdreht.Ich can only recommend it, but not if you own the iPhone 7 is worth it not necessarily unless you have to have the latest and if you are on the hardware. All the others maybe as well as I am annoyed by the instability of Androids and the non-coordinated components and software, which may be trusted times ran ,	1
Have had four iphones so far. The iPhone 8 is my fifth and at the same time the best! There is nothing to complain about! You also get it for less than 600 €.	1
So I have not contracted the phone from here so I do not write anything about shipping. The packaging is typically Apple compact, only the bare essentials but why does it fit more well? I've switched from the Iphone 6. At any rate note the speed difference. I'm actually opening apps in everything. The camera is really good the speaker of the battery lasts 20% longer than the iphone 6. the wireless charging is good but you have to get a high-quality charging station. I am happy with Apple as always.	1
Before I buy a new phone, I will always inquire in advance, get my opinion and then act accordingly. So seen there is the quality of the product here is no great discussion. The delivery itself was done to my complete satisfaction.	1
I'm completely satisfied with the I Phone 8 64GB nice big screen and the Good Camera quality because I am very satisfied. buy recommendation	1
I had before an iPhone 6 which scon has gone through a lot and needed uniaxial a new phone. I order this and I am very satisfied. I would do it again	1
I already have some cell phones, but they were always from Samsung. Now I wanted to test an iPhone. And after 10 minutes, I knew that my next will be an iPhone. It's fast, powerful, responds directly to the tap, has 3D touch and the best ... it can charge wirelessly. The wireless store is very cool when going to sleep! I hope I could help you in your decision to buy it or not help! Can you recommend as a charging station the "Anker 10W Fast Wireless Charger wireless inductive ..." !!!	1
I've been waiting for a new "" mobile phone "since my 6 years a year longer as usual ;-) The reason was actually not invented with the new smartphones`s new anymore. But since the battery from the 6 slowly faltering and I wanted a new toy .... Conclusion in advance: I am full of enthusiasm from the 8th Positive: * In everything noticeably faster. That was always nice to me BUT if it is so it is really fun * The finger sensor works SUPER> works from any position and fast. Why face recognition? * The new Homebutton (in contrast to the 6) is also a great feedback * Battery I would say as the 6th ... fits * etc ... the phone, the software works fineNegativ: * I can not think of anything now * oh yes, maybe not the latest design ... who needs it? Own opinion: * the Iphone X way too expensive (at some point is my end) and not much better, maybe prettier?! >> If it is me cooking an espresso I would be there !!!!! * Load wirelessly I have not tried * other manufacturers will build similarly good or from me somewhere / better cell phone's but the Apple-Dinger things with the IOS hold splendidAlso, clear Buy recommendation from me, especially for those who still have a 6 Series	1
The iPhone 8 is the latest smartphone from the house AppleEs is technically good, but something in the shadow of the hijacked iPhone X I have tested the phone for you and this has resulted in ... Design: Visually, the iPhone 8 reminds something to its predecessor even if the back is made of glass and the smartphone has got a surrounding frame made of aluminum. The glass case looks very classy, ​​but one had great concern that it would not exist as the case of the Samsung Galaxy case test. Apple even claims "it is the most stable glass that has ever existed in a smartphone." In a test that has iPhone 8 survived the 100 drops in the fall drum. However, the devices have not come away with it. Apple claims that the finish is produced in a seven-layer color process, which results in a particularly high color depth. Performance: The technical features are impressive. The iPhone 8 has 3 GB RAM and has the An internal controller controls a total of six cores, and for the first time, a chip integrates an Apple-developed three-core GPU. While the A10 processor of the previous generation could work a maximum of two cores simultaneously, all cores can be active at the same time on the A11. Camera and photos: With the same megapixel number compared to the predecessor, the photo quality should be better. In addition, the iPhone 8 offers a larger and faster sensor, new color filters and lower pixels. In addition, a new image processor guarantees faster autofocus, more advanced pixel processing and wider color capture. My conclusion: The iPhone 8 is definitely worth it. Although there are not much changes visually, but technology has taken a big step forward. If you liked this post, please flag it with "" useful	1
The delivery has worked very well and fast. The iPhone 8 was set up very quickly and feels very good. On my box were not German texts and in the box only foreign instructions, but everything works as usual.	1
for those who do not want to read much, first the pros and cons + High Performance + Good Camera + Fast and wireless charging + Sharp Display- Average Contrast- slightly shorter than iPhone 7- No fast charging power adapter included - No Dual CameraIt has a very good cameras and runs twice as fast as the S8. However, Apple can not really think of something new. The display has, for example. Since the iPhone 6 hardly done anything and the dual camera is still only the plus model "" allow "" If you want an innovative smartphone, must access to the iPhone X Apple or better. However, if you want a solid and fast smartphone with iOS, but is still the current Apple smartphone on the right track.The iPhone 8 is high-quality processed and the new glass back looks nobleThe iPhone 8 has a slightly smaller battery than the iPhone 7, which requires the device to have a shorter runtime.	1
Hello, the iPhone 8 is a mature very fast and equipped with a top camera smartphone and who has ever used a different operating system, the estimated this phone even more. Of course you should already know that Android apps are not transferable on iOS and that it can not accommodate 2 SIM cards but is synonymous in any description, because some of the here 1 star ratings made this bemängelten.Ich for me am very satisfied for 5 months, it just runs without jerking and twitching and the constant updates are still up to date even after years.	1
I have the iPhone 8 for about 2 weeks and I am thrilled by the Telefon.Etwas to my "" consumer history "": I had extremely many products from apple and about 3 years ago I decided to turn away from the Apple Fa often controversial "" eco-system "". Since then I have sold my apple products and I get a Windows Calculator and Android device. Actually on the iPhone 8: I am positively surprised by the device. The battery life is better than my old Android phones, the reception is much better compared to all the phones I had. The operating system is getting used to but very suitable for business use. The design is very noble. Photo are decent - the camera is one of the best on the market. The disadvantage is of course the price, for my iPhone 8 I have paid almost 1000 euros. But I do not regret a cent of the 1000 euros I spent. 2 weeks after the purchase, I think the iPhone was a good investment (I did not have that feeling many times when I bought electrical appliances). In summary: a good cell phone when you want to spend 1,000 Euros. The iPhone is very suitable for business use. If a value on battery and camera sets, he is well served with the phone.	1
Because of the low price you can ever be skeptical. However, this is definitely to Originalverpackte Neuware.Off obviously intended in my case for Greece, the font on the packaging is totally unimportant ...	1
Since Apple is no longer allowed to sell the iPhone 8 in the store, and Amazon has lowered the price of the black iPhone 8 64GB to 599 €. The decision was easy for me. My old iPhone SE was too small for me and was replaced by an iPhone 8, and I have to say that this decision was the right one. The camera is much better, the display size is finally pleasant. The Touch ID works much more precise, I do not have to make 2-5 attempts until my finger is finally recognized. I was supplied by Amazon a brand new iPhone.	1
So much ... Short, I try to go to Android again and again ... 2 weeks, all right .... but then I want my IOS again .. Boring, but it works. It always does what I expect .. the Android synonymous .... somehow there is much better ... display, camera, etc. but in sum, it is just the IOS ... it is always the same .. and running, and running ..	1
Review from Dutch buyer:- Sellername is 'TopShop'- Iphone is real.- Sim unlocked.- Couldn't receive Apple Care (online) yet, going to Apple store tomorrow.- Apple Care online couldn't receive activation data from Serial number, even though phone was activated with Vodafone.- Probably no issues to receive Apple Care in the Apple store.- Best price on the market (€600).- Packaging is in Dutch (& some more) language on the packaging.Very happy with purchase!  I'm only wondering how the company can make money on such a cheap price, and what their margin is?Happy Buying!	1
As usual, very good quality from Apple, technically up-to-date and everything you need to carry only one device. Battery could last a little longer in normal use about 10 hours, economical handling 16 hours, lasting use about 5-6 hours. Simple operating system which gets an update for about 5 years and thus justifies the higher price. Color is laterally gold or a little rose gold back is much brighter Ehrweis characterized very chic, everything else would often already described or you know it.	1
The Iphone 8 model from year 2017 is easy to use, for people who are used to androit at the beginning a bit weird to use. The Iphone 8 is super fast, well made and has great design! Price performance is still acceptable in relation to the Iphone X	1
The i Phone is the best device I have ever had. The basic features I had on it quickly, but every few days I discover new opportunities that you can use. Genila.	1
Despite strike at the Amazon the delivery was fast. There is nothing wrong with the iPhone itself. As stated, it was an iPhone 8. There were no difficulties installing and setting it up.	1
I've been thinking for a long time on Amazon to buy an iPhone 8, as many write here that it was broken or not original. I can not confirm everything, both the original packaging and the IMEI number, everything fits. I'm completely satisfied and would buy it here anytime! Clear Buy recommendation!	1
A classic. As expected, the i phone is just the i phone. The delivery was fast, the goods were undamaged and cheaper than in retail. Meanwhile, the device is a 1/2 year old and still works.	1
Super fast shipping! You do not have to write anything to the smartphone!	1
Everything great	1
Impeccable goods, only to be recommended. Fast delivery	1
Skeptical because of the price because it is cheaper to the wholesale prices over 200 €, abet great have got a top original welded Iphone with a super fast delivery.	1
Do what it should. Had first concerns about the low price. But I am satisfied device works	1
Great iPhone, it is new and completely original packed. Had to first fear that it is the price of B goods. This purchase was very worthwhile for me!	1
Personally, I prefer the fingerprint sensor of face recognition. 64 GB of storage is absolutely sufficient. These days, more and more people are going to the cloud. What else can you say about an iPhone?	1
Item as described - NEW, original packaging, produced in August 2018. (purchased from Topprice 24)	1
I am very satisfied, there is nothing more to write about.	1
The iPhone 8 is still suitable for the pocket! A hassle-free device - just works perfectly	1
I've been connected to Apple for years and find it very user-friendly. The phone is really good.	1
Had an Iphone SE before and that would be unfair to compare the two of them. But runs fine.	1
The product is genuine and works fine.. well packed... satisfactory. original..	1
very very satisfied, exactly the same iPhone as Apple, only cheaper! What more do you want? I just love it.	1

Finally a mobile phone that offers me a huge number of possibilities and never lets me down	1
Running	1
Super fast delivery, all respect	1
After I had the iPhone 5 for 4 years and the display did not participate in the end, had a new smartphone ago. As my iPhone 5 convinced me completely, I realized that the next smartphone will be an iPhone again. That's why I opted for the iPhone 8. Delivery went quickly, unpacked and immediately impressed. Visually, the 8 is a real eye-catcher, not too big, not too small and fits well in the hand. The device has started up very damn fast and I was immediately offered the so-called. Quick Start feature, which I could pair the new iPhone with my iPhone 5, provided the old device has iOS 11. Of course you can also start manually, but of the quick start Feature I was pretty excited. She has taken over all apps, settings and more of my old iPhone, so you do not have to spend time with annoying settings. With the manual version, it is even possible to transfer data from an Android smartphone. Impressive! In the end I felt with the iPhone 8 as if I have been around for a while. The Touch-ID function took some getting used to, but it takes the unlocking by code. To avoid misunderstandings: The fingerprint sensor offers no security component here! Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with the iPhone 8 and therefore I will advise in the future to an iPhone purchase.	1
Although the iPhone 8 is not a design revolution, it is still a great and modern smartphone. The glass back makes the now older design but a little more modern look, but in itself does not always have a new design, if the current is simply pertinent and in my opinion also looks good. The processing is, as Apple usual, seamless and excellent If you do not mind the thicker edges and the older design, you can safely grab the 8, instead of the X. The price difference is not justified because of a nearly borderless OLED display on the X mE, so I can recommend the handle to 8 rather , In the end, however, everyone has to decide for themselves.	1
I first thought about ordering the iPhone 8 here due to the recessions here. But everything top seller CVV has delivered quickly. It is an original Packaged new IPhone 8 ... IMEI tested ... it is not used or on the blacklist! To the iPhone itself ... usual Apple quality! Nothing to stop! Any time !	1
I have bought the iphone as a gift, since I have had an IPhone for years. It was delivered punctually and orginally packaged and has been in operation for a year now without any errors :)	1
You can complain about Apple as you like, but I've been a fan for a very long time, because everything just works as it should and without 100 unnecessary uninstallable apps!	1
Since I already had an iPhone 6, it was not a big change for me. Great display, good camera, only the touch button is unfamiliar.	1
Everything fits. Fast and good delivery. I ordered it for my girlfriend. Everything - now it has about 2 months - as expected good.	1
I was very skeptical, why is the iPhone so cheap, but I was surprised Super device for a fair price! Everything original packed. Including charging cable and original headphones! Would I buy here again and save money!	1
Binding and punctual delivery. The phone well packed and faultless.	1
I own the iPhone 8 now for half a year, previously I had Android and Windows Mobile. For a long time I had reservations about Apple products, mainly because of the prices. But it's just the truth: you get here both hardware and software a quality that is second to none. iOS runs like a Swiss clockwork, so far I had no reason for any complaint. Add to that the excellent workmanship and features of the iPhone. Display, camera, TouchID, processor - all really top. For this adulation, I would not be bribed, it's just my honest conclusion, which I now come after prolonged use. I do not like the new iPhones of the X-series so much anymore, I decided to buy the iPhone 8, precisely because it is the last of the "classic" model series and is still handy with 4.7 ". I hope that Apple still thinks in the future of the friends of compact smartphones, but almost fear that you go along the trend to "bigger and bigger". But the iPhone 8 will continue to receive regular updates, so you can enjoy this smartphone for a long time.	1
Everything is impeccable. I've bought a second time from the A Mountain mobile phone. I can recommend.	1
Everything was great - good value for money	1
Product met expectations, good and fast delivery!	1
Have the phone now for almost 1 week and I have exezive busy. From the design you do not have much to talk about high quality no sharp edges and an absolutely round overall product! The hardware is usually worse than the competition highly creditable, but everything is much smoother The battery lasts for a long time synonymous with continuous operation, I have a good 10-13h total time reached until the battery was at 0 in standby, it is up to 4 days. The camera is back always perfect. Super quality and in the dark a very good overall product. No noise and no major flaws. The focus is always fast and precise top speakers are better than I expected and sound very good. The headphones also do their job. Well, I think they have an adapter to do so since the 3.5mm connection has disappeared so top! The only drawback is again not expandable memory but with 64gb, I think trzd. All in one is it again a great product as you expect it from Apple! Anyone who wants to have an all-rounder who looks very stylish and good and to do everything and still has a little money I would recommend the phone For those with a small budget rather not because there are comparatively good phones for less money!	1
Have the iphone for about 8 months and I love it. The Iphone 8 is my first iPhone or Apple product. Sure, cheap it certainly is not but the typical other problems that my previous smartphone had (hanging the screen, crash of apps, broken micro etc) I could not yet determine. Of course, everything can change after 2 years but so far I do not regret the purchase a bit.	1
At that time I have slammed via Preisjaeger and bought the phone for 619 ¬ via Amazon - I do not need much to write about the product. Tip Top!	1
Article as described - at a good price. I would buy again at this provider. Have the product for 2 days ...	1
Super fast shipping (ordered Sunday evening - Monday evening there!) IPhone is just an iPhone.Who once in the clutches of this device, is not so fast away. But overall, the price and fast delivery convinced me	1
It's always the long discussion iPhone or Android. I've been back to IOS for a long time using Android and I'm surprised how good and fluid the OS is. I would buy in the future only Apple except they continue to exaggerate with the prices beyond the 1000 ¬	1
What Apple does, Samsung just can not, once Iphone Iphone always. The operation is simply much more pleasant and the compatibility between ios devices is second to none.	1
Ordered on Tuesday morning, handed over to DHL at noon and arrived on Thursday noon. If my name on the shipping label had not been confused with my street, it would have even arrived on Wednesday ... The phone is new and was in original packaging. The iPhone itself I have to get used to, as I was pretty happy with my before Sony Xperia Z3 compact, which unfortunately after 3 years always had more problems: / Since the iPhone with 629.90 ¬ significantly more than my Sony (367 ¬) has cost, I expect a better life.	1
Hello, I think I do not have to comment on the technical details, because there is enough information on the internet. Overall, I am very satisfied with the technique. If you have an iPhone that is not many years old, you do not have to buy the iPhone 8. For example, I had the iPhone 5c before and now I switched to the iPhone 8. This was definitely worth it. That design is great. Especially with the glass back. I bought the space gray model. Inductive charging works well. It only takes about half an hour longer for the device to be charged (estimated). I recommend everyone here to charge the iPhone 8 with an iPad power supply, for example, 12W. This is much faster than inductive charging and faster than normal charging via the included power supply. Plus, you do not have to spend a lot of money on a MacBook power adapter for the fast-charging function. In addition, I recommend that you buy a case for the phone, because the glass back is certainly very sensitive. The only big negative aspect of the iPhone eight is, in my opinion, that the battery could be better. In my opinion, this keeps much too short. All in all, it's a good smartphone. The shipping did not work well with me, although I had selected the premium shipping. The device took four days instead of three, but I think that this is not Amazon's fault, but Hermes. For example, if you ship your device through DHL, I do not need to worry about the product arriving too late.	1
You can or you have to summarize this review. Except for a new chipset, a slightly better camera, as with the 7er already the IP certification and new colors, there is nothing spectacular new here And that's a good thing. It's just as usual since there are iPhones. The operating system is the main point here. All in all, you get the hardware passive with the hardware. My 5er ran smoothly, my 5s also, 6 and 6s as well. My wife has a 7 plus and that too runs and runs. I notice now the 8er no difference. If you compare the 4 and the 8, that will of course be noticed. But in the way you got used to it bit by bit. I can not do without Face-ID and borderless displays without Homebutton. Good system, good hardware, feel and look are just as great, no matter if iPad, iPod or whatever. Whether you want to spend the money, you have to decide for yourself. No one builds bad phones anymore.	1
... was bought from me as a successor to the iPhone 6. And I have to say that it really convinces. It is much faster in really all areas (unlocked by fingerprint now in a split second). The photos have a great quality and live photos are now finally possible. Why should I pay 100 Euro more to order it at A ... or to buy it at the store? Shipping and packaging in the usual Amazon quality. 1A goods !!!	1
Have now completed a personal move from the Iphone 6 on the current Iphone 8. The size of both devices is identical, only the faster CPU and the larger RAM are in everyday life very positive auf.The back of the 8er is now completely made of glass, so Being somewhat more sensitive like the 6-series. Through the glass backside the charge via induction (QI standard) is now possible, but have not yet tried it. All in all, I am very satisfied with the iPhone 8	1
Had before the iPhone 6 and now the 8, it is just perfect. Looks thanks to the glass surface very high quality and noble, the camera is very good. Very fast system.	1
After 5 years of Android usage I did not want anymore and decided to buy an iPhone 8 from Apple. I have to say: It's not perfect, but miles better than the competition from Android! The performance, the integration of the apps and iOS in general is simply much better prepared than with e.g. Samsung.I can only recommend it to anyone!	1
I already had an iphone before and am also convinced of this, price-performance ratio is right, meets my requirements, beautiful discreet color, I would buy again.	1
The fastest mobile phone in the world, rightly! Have my 6s delivered, because it was still tidy value. And I wanted the latest technology. Camera is still bisssl better, true tone display very neat, wireless load perfect, fastest processor awesome, the new haptics in the system great. Image stabilization on board now. New home button. And in addition waterproofness, it was worth the change! I recommend front and back ne protection film from scratches. Alternative to the X is it. * Edit * I have now changed to the xx size and new fresher design *	1
I bought the iPhone somewhere else, but that's not relevant. I had a 6s before and had to choose between the iPhone X and the 8. Due to the love for the Homebutton, the mostly same technology and the extra charge, I have now for the 8 decided .... And it does not regret. The speed is great and I would not indulge the inductive charging! The glass back makes a very high quality impression. The camera and the display are as usual sharp (the LCD display is the OLED display in no way)! Even if the iPhone is not cheap, in my opinion worth the extra price for the larger Speicherervariante.Der jump from 64 to 256 GB is quite large. I also agree with other previous speakers, once iPhone always iPhone.I already had the 3G, the 4, the 5s, the 6s and now the 8.I think it will not be the last ...	1
Since the iPhone X has finally broken my pain threshold in the price, I actually felt the iPhone 8 as a very good deal. Just over 4 years ago I paid € 799,00 for a 32GB iPhone 5s and today I get an iPhone 8 with at least 64GB.Now the iPhone 8. You get exactly what you expect. A valuable lightning fast phone with a nice camera and a cable store and yes, the Qi charger must of course to the socket, where else should the power come from? The display is good, for an IPS even very good, but can not with the Amoled of Keep up with X or Galaxy S8. The latter I had before the 8 and thus the display in the iPhone 8 does not seem so outstanding. There is no help for Truetone. But, clearly, worlds are better than Samsung's is the standby consumption on iOS and that's just Apple. On weekdays, I get so loose about two with a battery charge, that was almost impossible with the S8. Next, it is that since the iPhone 7 stereo speakers, which are really okay, depending on the sound source, sometimes even excellent and again a comparison to Find, many times better than the monaural speaker of the Galaxy S8. Conclusion, the iPhone 8 is a total of a top device.	1
For 8 years I had mostly Android smartphones and of course was very happy with it. But now - 2018 - I finally wanted something "different". I decided after a short time for the iPhone 8. Before the purchase, I have been informed about this device intensively. And I can say - yes, it was worth it, I am very enthusiastic and never thought how many options you have with Apple. First impression: The phone looks totally chic and high quality, just by the glass facade and the display. But I have to say, compared to my S7 Edge it's quite "" heavy "", but you get used to it. Operation: Of course you have to get used to the functions of iOS. Often "" touche "" I still on the nonexistent "" back button "", but of course that's pure habit. Still, I'm fascinated how fast and smooth the phone works and at the same time it's still "" quiet "" , I would prefer not to put it away, even if the battery is less than 2000 mAh, it currently lasts longer than my S7 Edge (which is in my possession for 1.5 years) The integrated fingerprint sensor works perfectly and smoothly. I saved my two thumbs and just used the index finger to test it. My phone could not be unlocked and that shows me how accurate the sensor works. Camera: Selfies and normal photos are now razor-sharp and catch much more details. The color is very intense. Photos with flash are no longer totally overexposed, but of course. In addition, some pretty filters were installed, which give the photo again a bit of individuality. Microphone + Speaker: Meanwhile, so many voice messages are made and listened to by many. The microphone of the iPhone is great, many already said that my voice is much clearer and clearer with less background noise (compared to the S7 Edge). But also the voice messages of others are no longer like "" noise "", but pleasant. Music or other sounds seem to me as if I had high quality speakers connected to the iPhone, although it is only the speakers of the phone itself. Additional recommendation: Since the device is made of glass, I recommend everyone a bulletproof glass (cheap to find here on Amazon) and a protective cover, so that the protection and the value is maintained long! Conclusion: I do not regret this purchase and me recommend this device to all people who would like to experience something different than Android!	1
The delivery of the iPhone 8 was as announced already after a few days, the goods were originally packed and corresponded exactly to my wishes, elegant in design and intuitive to use.	1
I'm very satisfied. The iPhone 8 can also be regarded as the second major facelift of the iPhone 6 (except for the 6s). The degree of maturity is therefore very high. The design has been further perfected. The form factor is almost perfect for me. In addition, there is the possibility of inductive charging. I deliberately decided against the X, even though I was about to buy it. Face ID (slower than Touch ID and sometimes awkward) and OLED (risk of burn-in is still present - especially in applications such as Google Maps) are simply not yet mature for me. Especially in view of a price of over € 1000. The new A11 Bionic is incredibly fast. There are virtually no delays. Above all, surfing the Internet is felt partly faster than a current Notebook.Auch the camera system has been further optimized. The noise behavior in the low light range is even better than in my five-year-old SLR camera. The dynamic range is also very good. The bottle neck is here still the small lens. Picture details are still relatively blurred. This can be seen only in greatly enlarged images. Overall, for a smartphone but a very considerable Bildqualität.Ich can recommend the iPhone 8 so much!	1
The device has been as good as new, I had not expected the headphones and adapter plugs. The price was completely ok.	1
Top mobile phone. Do not be influenced by tests. I do not know a smartphone which makes better photos. And who wants a compact phone is well advised. Accu is also very good and everything runs smoothly. At all the blasphemers no envy arise.	1
As the smartphone age began, I always had Android devices, which were slow and therefore useless with time. Therefore, I bought with the 5s the then flagship of Apple and I remained loyal to the model 8. First impression: The iPhones were In my opinion, always the fastest models on the market and that has not changed with the iPhone 8. In the processing Apple has once again done everything right and this time even the back with a glass instead of aluminum versehen.Diese is the device a little better as the predecessors in the hand. Of course, through the glass, the weight of the iPhone has increased a bit. It is great in the hand and you can reach everything without problems. If not (especially for users of the "" Plus "" variant) there is still the possibility with two gentle touches on the home button to pull the current app down to the center of the screen. Of course, this device also has no headphone jack, so you have to work with a Lightning adapter. (This is not enclosed with the device and must be purchased separately. Cost about 10 €) But now something that has me a little disappointed.The Camera: Here Apple uses a new camera sensor. These make excellent images and are among the best that the smartphone range has to offer. In low light, the detail resolution has become a little better and the colors look more natural than before. The Google Pixel, or Samsung Note 8 get in the dim light anyway the exposure better. For details are usually heraus¬ worked better. Therefore, it must be said that both Android devices rather strong colors and the iPhone acts more restrained, but mostly the correct hue hits. Next the known problem, Akku.Akku: Of course, the iPhones were never known for their long runtimes, but the iPhone 8 is slightly better than the predecessor. The battery has shrunk again, but you notice nothing. Of course, it is not enough for top positions. After a working day without much use, the iPhone does not necessarily have to be charged, with moderate use even two days drin.Samsung, LG and Google create here with the top models mehr.Mal again is a 5- Watt power supply to the device. Since the iPhone also supports USB Power Delivery, after 30 min already 50% percent load. The appropriate USB-C to Lightning cable with power adapter costs about 90 € with Apple. If it is a bit cheaper, should be with the wireless charging (Qi). Since the iPhone 8, this feature is given and is cheap to get thanks to widespread standard (about 15 €). Conclusion: A technically excellent smartphone with a cool design. For the next few years it has enough performance, the battery life is good and the display respectable. Thanks to 12 megapixels makes the iPhone great and beautiful pictures. The changes to the predecessor are minimal. The expensive quick charge and wireless charging is slow and rarely practical. That's why I think it's more of a 7s than an 8. For users of an iPhone 7, or 6s worth the transition, because the improvements are hardly noticeable in everyday life.	1
iPhone 8 - This is already a great device ... With the iPhone 8, Apple introduces a new generation of smartphones, which convinces by exciting exciting features, strong performance and an elegant design. What I really like is that the iPhone 8 is made of very sturdy glass and aluminum. Feels great in the hand. To the improved flawless retina display. Also new is that the smartphone can be charged wirelessly. Already a great thing. The iPhone 8 is based in its design clearly on the previous model, but sets new standards, especially in terms of display, speaker and camera quality. It consists of a 4.7 inch HD retinal display integrated 3D Touch.Eine further improvement was also in terms of color accuracy. Thanks to the automatic white balance of the new True Tone technology, the display adapts to the lighting conditions in your environment, ensuring a pleasant and relaxed viewing experience. The natural colors not only protect your eyes, but also show all images, videos and games razor-sharp .25% louder than the 7 Series 12 megapixel camera with wide-angle lens .... Even in low light and using the flash, you can take professional pictures with sharp details and blurry backgrounds in portrait mode. You can now get slow motion videos in a full HD resolution. The 7 megapixel front camera with integrated retina flash and image stabilization ensures that every selfie becomes a small work of art. The dimensions are67.3mm x 138.4mm x 7.3mm148grams	1
After the iPhone 5s certainly one of the best iPhones so far. Top size and weight. Absolutely perfect workmanship and speed that is second to none ... simply terrific. By contrast, my S8, which I had before really not good. And I thought that Samsung has been unbeatable since the s6 in terms of speed. But I was wrong. The iPhone 8 opens everything immediately. Really IMMEDIATELY. As it should be with any smartphone these days. The loading screen in asphalt needed smooth 5 seconds and you can go jet ... Phenomenal and so still seen on any cell phone ... Camera top. Display top (and again and again the proof that nobody needs more than Full Hd on a mobile phone) Battery lasts for less than 1.5 days. With much use about 20-26 hours. That's ok. Now the box is finally waterproof and can be charged wirelessly. Yes. The ipunkt, which unfortunately was standard for many other manufacturers for a long time. And the stereo speakers are also awesome. Thanks for that! I fell in love with the iPhone again after a long Samsung trip. A great part!	1
Got a reasonable price for my iPhone 7 and then bought the iPhone 8. Well, the innovations are limited. The old proven design continues, but that's a point that would not even bother me. Much more bothers me because of the battery. It has not gotten any better (actually smaller, but Apple promised more uptime with a more power efficient processor). Otherwise, there is again a good iPhone with a brilliant camera and top hardware, especially with a Cpu, which is ahead of the competition 50%. In plain language ... Apple has swept the competition out of the way for a long, long time. Worth mentioning is the stereo sound. Who has an iPhone 7, knows how good it already sounds there, but the iPhone 8 is even better and sounds much fuller, louder and sauberer.Apple has clearly brought a good improvement with unfortunately the same look, but a lot, would have been much more expandable. I opted for the iPhone 8 because I do not like the iPhone X visually. Since Samsung has brought something nice on the market with the S8, but with your unacceptable software and me just had an Ios ago. Never again Android I say only. From me a clear Buy recommendation. Not maybe if you have an iPhone 7, but who can take it financially will be happier with the camera and the stereo sound.	1
I was very pleased. Happy again, great phone	1
Great mobile without problems. The phone is expensive but worth the money.	1
just the Mercedes among the smartphones.	1
Since my previous iPhone 8 unfortunately had problems with the WLAN, I ordered this product as a warehouse deal yet again and was not disappointed. Since I am still attached to the home button, it had to be an iPhone 8 again and of the functions and the photo quality of this mobile phone is always enough.	1
Super satisfied	1
Initially a little confused by some critical reviews, but still dared and I'm not disappointed - so far! :) Instructions etc were exclusively in Eastern European languages, so this phone may actually be more for their market. That does not matter to me, as long as it does its job and holds for a few years:) Can not complain after a month, on the contrary. I made sure on the website of apple that it is new. That was it. So from me for the price clear purchase recommendation! :)	1
Was a bit skeptical at first because the smartphone is sold much cheaper than in all electrical markets. However, the iPhone has been around for a few months and I'm still very satisfied. The mobile phone was delivered undamaged and works perfectly.	1
Good smartphone for people who would otherwise need glasses. The operating system IOS runs flawlessly. The Appstore is being monitored. If you look at the Android systems and store on the other hand, you do not want to use anything else.	1
Wanted for a long time a new device of the house Apple. This iPhone is perfect for videos because of the larger display!	1
As with all Apple products, the prices are spicy. Compared to the next generation but the equipment is neat. So far, I have not regretted the investment.	1
It came as expected and was not damaged, original from Apple. Previously the best phone, which I had! Mega camera and great system (despite the change from Android to Apple)	1
Now I have this iPhone a while. It is meanwhile the third mobile phone from the house Apple. Can only recommend and not imagine anything else.	1
Everything was great! The iphone arrived quickly in excellent condition. Hopefully it will not break as fast as the last.	1
Top everything is mega	1
Was unsure to order such an expensive device on the Internet and not to go to the store but I do not regret it a second. Delivery was fast and the phone is working properly.	1
I was skeptical if the cell phone is original but it is super fast and original arrived, only recommended.,	1
We are very happy with the article!	1
I was afraid to order my iPhone on Amazon, but I did not need the worry at all. I am satisfied with the price-performance ratio and fast delivery	1
The delivery was fast, the iPhone was originally packed with the described accessories and works flawlessly	1

Super fast delivery. Durability must be checked in the near future	1
Everything great	1
A very nice phone	1
Everything as expected. So far I have never had problems with my iPhone.	1
The phone is all around class, but the price is also "class" (too high). Display large and good resolution (great photos). Usual private use.	1
Did not regret the purchase.	1

Thanks for fast delivery and as described	1
Super satisfied. recommendable	1
Good mobile phone	1
All ok!	1
Perfect	1
I give 5 stars, because it's all as I imagined. The phone was original welded and arrived on time. I had an iPhone 6s Plus before and have now decided to switch to the 8 Plus. And it's really worth it! Good battery life, great display resolution and the camera is the blast! The portrait mode is great. I'm just excited. Definitely buy recommendation! :-)	1
At first I would not have a serious impression, since the price has changed every minute by about 100 €. However, I did buy it because it was the only supplier selling gold. The iPhone came in its original packaging with all the accessories, but shipping unfortunately took 5 days, even though it was shipped from Amazon and I have Prime.	1
Oh yes, the iPhone X (ten or ten) is so beautiful, so innovative, so great and in general, the best there is in the world. Is that really? And why is the 8+ in so many so-called "magazines" ", all write more or less the same crap, as if they distribute the articles among themselves and would only slightly change, so neglected treated? I use iPhones because I, at least to Time to have a little more confidence in the Apple Privacy Policy than in the Google Privacy Policy. Tim Cook is always saying that Apple does not live on selling data, just selling hardware and OS's, but the "" X "" is for me a device that a. too fragile, b. too expensive (even the 8+ is not a snapper but just in painful setting) and c. Technically bringing innovations that I neither need nor want! So the 8+ has exactly 8 good (buy) reasons for me (of course there is more) and I'm really happy with it! 1. Timeless and beautiful form. Yes, I do not think they are stale but successful and I like them! In addition, great stereo speakers that are quite enough for occasional listening to music, Samsung still does not get the S8 with the S8. Super fast A11 Bionic processor Incredible fix! As has the "" X "" synonymous nothing better, namely, has the same processor. Glass back allowing wireless charging. I do not mind, especially since the open Qi standard can be used. Glass back thereby lower SAR value (compared to iPhone 7+). Personally, I think it's important! 5. Again improved camera through the new signal processor. Very important to me! 6. High quality LCD display, no "burn in" possible as with OLEDs (iPhone X) and therefore natural colors.7. Super battery life. Only Apple gets with comparatively small batteries such maturities out. You have to admit that without any reason.8. And now the best for me. Still Touch ID. I do not want a face scanner. Apple leaves the customer but once again no choice. One would have at the fragile (test - Stiftung Warentest) "" X "", similar to Huawei or Samsung, behind a fingerprint scanner install and then leave the customer the choice. But no, that would have meant additional costs and limited the profits. Instead, the "" fans "" made it clear that this is a musthave ". it is, at least for me, but not! I feel the fingerprint scanner as perfect and it works absolutely fast and reliable! No idea what I do, if there are only iPhones with Facescanner ?? Otherwise there is not much to say. iPhone just great quality, everything works as it should, works perfectly with my MacBook together, gets years of updates. The high price will be amortized, because I will use the device the next (at least) 4 years. I can only recommend the iPhone 8 Plus. In this form, it is proven, protected with protective cover against falls, battery can be with some Bastlergeschick yourself exchange. And it stays up to date for a few years. Yes it is expensive but who buys cheap, often buys several times! :-) Update 02.02.18 ============= Have the iPhone 8 (times) Plus ;-) now almost two months and my enthusiasm has increased even more! The battery seems to have got even better.The camera is just great. Another reviewer said she was not so good! I can not agree with the best will. Coloring, dynamic range, lens intensity, shutter speed. So extremely good for a smartphone. Had a Galaxy S7, which was (and still is) very good. The 8+ works out details (in JPEG format) in my opinion but even better. In Lowlight, they give nothing. The bokeh effect is better than I would have expected. Partially succeed, with a little routine, great shots. The portrait mode is for me more of a gimmick but quite funny. What the Galaxy ahead of the iPhone, however, is the Pro mode. I wish that too. So Apple, homework machen.Mit my handsfree in the car, the 8+ coupled immediately and the quality is just as good as my old Nokia and now is really a compliment! Crashes or freeze I had not loaded it is very fast. However, I use a 12 watt charger from the iPad. That's about the same as Quickcharge :-) I bought a protective cover from Spigen. Then the iPhone is indeed hidden and stingy with its charms but in case of a fall, it is well secured. And safety comes first, and I now own a Bose Headset QC 20 in Ears with Noise Canceling. Designed for Apple. So that you can use as a phone headset. That was a very good investment. Takes away a lot of noise when traveling by train or plane. Sounds good in music and keeps much better in the ear than the included headset! I will from time to time post new impressions and expand my review! I hope help to the reader in order to können.Update 10/11/18 ============= What can I say that 8+ still runs as Bolle, by iOS 12 even greater smoothness I imagine on. But can really only be imagination. There were no crashes, no problems. It just works. However, I would really like to slowly, the Apple at the camera software nachbessert. A real annoyance when you see your friends handling the Samsung and Huawais of this world. A Pro mode in which I could set ISO, exposure time and the like would be really great and overdue! And why I still can not choose 16: 9 attitude in photos (in the case of videos), almost borders on insolence. Man Apple, now take the wishes of the customers finally seriously? Sure there are third-party software, I would still prefer it if Apple would invest a little more (detail) love in the camera software. Can not be that hard! And one more thing I want to say. The three new iPhones that are already or soon (XR) on the market, have no more Touch ID. Sorry, apple, you lost me. I refuse your overpriced Face ID number. I do not like them, I want Touch ID. Finally come down from your now high horse and offer your loyal fans what they want! Why do not you build in addition Touch ID (eg on the back) and leave me as a customer the choice? You can not be so greedy for money !!! You have already bunkered more than Dagobert Duck ?! ;-) So please, build the 5 Euro part again!	1
Sure, the iPhone X is the super thing .... but also the super price! I opted for the 8 Plus, because it is technically almost equal, because it is an iPhone with the underlying Bedienphillosophie ... and because I do not want "showcases", but use it. I put it anyway in a solid protective cover, which applies a few millimeters. It's a good smartphone with super cameras ...	1
Super fast delivery, original packed IPhone everything great	1
I opted for this smartphone after a very long time of consideration and eternal comparison on the Internet, as it was the closest match for my requirements. I have to say, although I only had Samsung phones before and this step was hard to get an Apple device, I have not regretted this decision. The habituation went fast and simple. Crucial for me was in comparison to the other smartphones, the performance of the iPhone 8+, which makes the competition in this price range look old by far. It reacts immediately and opens application without delay. The dual camera with 12MP each also says a lot and also makes great pictures and recordings in up to 4K with 60 FPS - that creates no device of the competition and is due to the powerful processor from Apple. The memory version with 64 GB is enough for me completely and will also be sufficient for any normal user who does not want to record 1000 videos in UHD. The quality is very good and the glass optics makes something really good. The fingerprint scanner works reliably and leaves nobody in the cell phone. The cables and accessories are also processed to high quality. The wireless shop, I could not test yet, I have the necessary accessories yet. I can definitely recommend this phone to anyone who firstly wants to get away from the usual Android, second, is on performance and third, who does not feel like over 900 ¬ for to spend the iPhone X want.	1
Once iPhone, always iPhone and especially the last of its kind in the proven 16: 9 format! Had some androids tested, all quite failed and after my then 7 Plus now the good 8 Plus. In a jiffy, the backup was uploaded from the cloud, it could not be any better.	1
I ordered the iPhone 8 Plus at o2. I was the iPhone X too expensive and I would rather have the big 8 with a lot of space. The Internet as a result, worth an X anyway only for real Apple fans, because the 8 Plus can keep up. The camera is awesome and the battery lasts a long time. It does not get warm even after playing for a long time! The 7 Plus, however, a colleague was right hot. The home button is also really class with the 3D touch. Can not complain in general! Only a few small but also annoying things are there: - Although it was a new smartphone (not anymore), it has hung here and there times, which is forgivable but should not be with a new device recently I had massive problems with my wifi on the Fritzbox 7490, whereas no other device had something to complain about. Not an iPhone 8 for example. The iPhone 8 Plus my brother in law also had problems. The only thing that helped was an older Fritzbox. The iPhone 8 Plus or generally iPhones are often not so good with Fritzboxen.Ansonsten I can only recommend the smartphone and especially for those who do not want to spend so much money for an X with little memory.	1
For this price it is unbeatable. In original packaging and with invoice. Perfect! Great thank you.	1
I am very satisfied, I could not even discover blemishes! I can only recommend, very reliable and correct!	1
Very to Epfehlen. Delivery came before specified period. (Smart Tech Electronics)	1
Everything great!	1
Fast shipping, original iPhone 8 Plus and original packed and sealed. Everything in German and without problems. For the price really unbeatable.	1
I am more than satisfied with the product. The order came quite fast. I switched from iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone 8 Plus. The camera can not be compared to a world of difference. I can really recommend this iPhone to anyone.	1
The product is new, originally packed and arrived undamaged. It works flawlessly and was very easy to set up. It does not really matter that this is an iPhone manufactured for foreign countries. I've got a MQ8L2NC / A. One is not limited by this, however, packaging back and Bedinungssnleitung are not in German. Nevertheless, the product can be used properly. Similarly, this can justify the cheaper price than Apple.de	1
Finally my ... everything worked out great and I can only recommend for me the best iPhone ..bin but also giant Apple fan ...	1
The phone is very good and works without any interference. I went from the 6 Plus directly to the 8 Plus and I am so satisfied. Class mobile phone.	1
I had an iPhone 6 before and am really excited about the change. The speed, the design, the size (you get used to it quickly) really everything I notice in the first few days only positive!	1
Has worked great. After 2 days, the phone was there.	1
Pro: Fast delivery. High quality processed. Very good camera Very good battery life (I get away with it easily 3 days.) I had no problems with the phone when charging. The phone has not deformed during charging. There is nothing negative to say. A very nice phone.	1
I got the phone and must admit that it is a really good device! Battery lasts a long time and it has already fallen down to me 100 times without what happened! I would recommend it !	1
The cell phone is just amazing super camera very good performance just great	1
Since the iPhone 3GS I am a smartphone user of Apple.This, however, is my first NEW device purchased.The unpacking experience is unsurpassed.To other 1A quality, I can not add anything that is not already known. The battery has not bloated with my new device so far synonymous. ;-)All in all I am very satisfied.	1
I already bought the iPhone in September. Super nice contact. Top goods. Always my pleasure.	1
The cell phone arrived today, and I have to say the camera is really awesome. I immediately made a direct comparison with my old Iphone 7 Plus, and the differences are really huge. The Iphone 8 Plus came from France, which is why the shipping took a bit long. Anyway, I can recommend the Iphone 8 Plus.	1
Original iPhone probably came from another country, so the instructions for the quick start were only in two completely illegible languages ​​... but that did not bother me, therefore	1
I ordered the product from Turbado in Berlin some time ago. It came after 2 days so very swiftly I'm due for a praise Turbado ever. I switched from the iPhone SE to the 8 Plus and was not convinced of the size at the beginning. After a maximum of one week I was convinced of the big model. I still can not get the battery out within a day. If you do not want to spend so much money on the iPhone X, it's perfect because it has the same chip and it has almost the same camera. It just does not have the Face ID but Face ID has not convinced me drastically to buy the iPhone X. The iPhone greatly facilitates my everyday life as a student. I am Head Boy and therefore I have to send at least one email a day. Conclusion: The iPhone 8 Plus was the right choice for me, there is nothing to complain about! LG Paul	1
At first glance I was a bit confused about the iPhone 8 Plus, it looks just like the iPhone 7 Plus. However, when I saw the back, I liked it. The golden version looks the best in my opinion. The color is pretty much what I wanted. The gold iPhone 7 Plus was too yellowish to me, and rose gold was way too pink. The new color, however, is the perfect center. For most, the design seems outdated for me but it looks like the iPhone should look like. A perfected iPhone in the final stage. No ugly antenna strips, no sensitive aluminum and no annoying bending mehr.So should have been the iPhone 6, it would probably synonymous if the developers had more than just a year to develop a new smartphone.Wehalb should be an iPhone 8 Buy Plus? The question is quite simple to answer. If you like Apple's tradition I guess you'll probably prefer the iPhone 8 Plus to the iPhone X. For me, the iPhone X is not a stand-alone device, it's a special edition of the iPhone 8 Plus adapted for Android fans. Apple throws all its convincing overboard just to impress these Samsung fanboys. There is not much difference between the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X. Touch ID becomes Face ID, Animojis are there (more of a gimmick), portrait exposure has both and this very funny Display.Apple stood for minimalism and simplicity, but with the best performance as possible.Therefore, the iPhone 8 Plus has a Darreninsberechtigung.Es provides the latest and best processor on the market, this works perfectly with the operating system together and offers an incredible pace. Everything runs smoothly here, the iPhone 8 Plus does not allow mistakes. The camera is as usual on the highest level, the pictures have an incredible sharpness to the edges and 4K videos with 60FPs are just technical upper class. What another strength of the iPhone is, is the display. This is synonymous if it is only Full HD is sufficiently sharp, the viewing angles are the same as a magazine and the contrast is very natural. Otherwise, one has minimally improved the speakers, wireless charging and fast charging are now included. A smartphone, which has no weaknesses and actually a perfect device is in my opinion definitely a Darseinsberechtigung.Klare buy recommendation on my part, if you do not want the iPhone X you get nothing better than this one.	1
Hello! I bought the iPhone 8 Plus 64GB in Space Gray on 27.09.2017! I already had an iPhone 6, 6s, 7 Plus and now the iPhone 8 Plus! What can I say! The best iPhone I've ever had! Top performance, very good camera and battery lasts at least an hour longer than the 7 Plus !! Well clear from the front it looks like the last iPhone! But with the glass behind beautiful view !!! Just a top iPhone !!!	1
Super Smartphone, Super Kamara and Super High money well what can you say just great	1
Perfect mobile I switched from my 6s to the 8 plus am just in love with the phone and the look also very fine with the glass like me super :)	1
..all first class! Anyone who has ever had it in their hands would not give it up! The camera I would like to highlight! 4k in 60FPS and that is a device in pants pockets format? Even if the price is more than steep, who wants quality, quality and nothing but quality, who has to dig deep into the bag!	1
Everything went great - shipping was as always fast through Amazon. The iPhone itself was probably imported from Scandinavia. I conclude that from the "instructions", as they were printed in the local languages. The iPhone itself is the same worldwide and therefore no differences to the German version available. The accessories, especially the power plug, of course, also fits easily. The network operators are all supported. In short - everything works as it should and there are no disadvantages. Orginal packed goods from Apple!	1
I have not used iPhone for so long, but it convinced me. The iPhone 8 plus meets my expectations fully. It is frugal and super fast with the usual feel of the middle button (iPhone X does not have these anymore). However, a shortcoming of this product has not been resolved by Apple until today (as is the iPhone X). From a temperature below 7 degrees, it is no longer possible to take pictures outside with flash. The Apple Forum is loudly reported and it is confirmed by all. However, Apple has so far ignored and dismissed with statements like "" does not meet the specification "". I think if all iPhones manage to take pictures at 4 degrees, it should get the iPhone 8 (plus) and the X too. Therefore, only 4 stars but with Apple together. The seller was the super fast and easy.	1
Everything was described in detail by the previous speakers. The device is pretty fast and the photos are brilliant, they are starting to compete with a SLR camera. The device is trimmed on AI, but the practical benefits you have not yet so will change soon. Inductive charging is also great. Touch ID is the change takes some getting used to pressing the button not so deep, but you learn quickly. Overall, the device looks more modern in everyday life.	1
The price of the iPhone 8 Plus is simply top. It costs at least 100 € more in the trade. The delivery took place within a week and there is nothing to complain about. The photos are awesome! Insanity quality, which was the main reason why I chose this phone. The portrait mode is absolutely great. The background blurs easily and the subject is razor-sharp. In addition, there are some features in this mode, such as contour light or black background. The mobile phone is stable, is super fast and the new home button is after a short time getting used to much better than its predecessor. Absolute Buy recommendation for the phone and also from this dealer ,	1
Have I brought the 8, because the contract renewal makes the iPhone Xr worse photos, there is something wrong with the white balance. The movies are getting a little better on the Xr, but that's just a touch. The photos are just going very well with the '8', imo still the best photos of all smartphone cameras because the dynamic range is felt to be bigger than others, too And I have definitely received a new iPhone, the bad reviews on this I do not quite understand. You can exchange yes, if it does not fit. Conclusion: who wavers between the Xr, and the 8, I recommend the 8 Series , All the other specs did not really convince me on Xr, and the camera is just worse. Since I take a lot of pictures, that makes a difference to me.	1
Everything worked out well for me. The device is new, everything original packed and perfectly fine. I had previously read in the product reviews that some buyers have received used cell phones. That was not the case with me (fortunately), I am very satisfied. And with ordered shell and screen protector - so a total of three items together! I am often dissatisfied with the Amazon's own delivery service lately but here it has worked out exemplary. So here's a big praise in this direction, must be said so synonymous times. For the iPhone itself, I can only say that I have carefully considered whether I take an XR or 8er. The XS is outrageously expensive. But I would like to have the homebutton as well as the fingerprint sensor because I do not want FaceID. And I am very satisfied, everything is running smoothly. And even if the price is not exactly a bargain, it is and remains Apple quality. I can recommend the iPhone 8 Plus.	1
I had an Iphone 6 Plus until a few days ago. Unfortunately, I accidentally but definitively shredded it. The 6Plus I had 3.5 years and would certainly have done a few months his service reliable. Since it was so reliable, I chose the 8Plus for the current successor and am thrilled. It is much faster.	1
I've made the change from the iPhone 6 16GB to the iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB because I've lost noticeably in performance and speed. With the 8 Plus you're technically up to date again, the speed is great, the performance and the general tuning just super. Optically, the iPhone 8 has hardly changed its predecessors. The back is now made of glass, which on the one hand is very nice to look at, but on the other hand again a potential weak point and repairs to the glass are the Risiko.Apple used in the iPhone 8 and the 8 plus the A11 Bionic chip, which all other opponents in the Shadow poses. the camera is probably one of the highlights of the new IPhone 8 Plus. It has a 12 MP dual camera and a 7 MP front camera. There is a lot possible here. 4K recordings, portrait mode and live photos are a few keywords. Of course, Touch ID is also on board again, this will not be the case with the iPhone X anymore. For me, this was a reason not to take the iPhone X, but rather the 8 Plus, since I got so used to Touch ID. The battery should according to the manufacturer, similar to the 7 Plus, allow about 21 hours of talk time, up to 13 hours of Internet use, 14 hours of video playback and 60 hours of audio playback. Of course, I have not done these tests in practice, but I can say that the battery lasts all day, I leave the house in the morning at 7, and when I go to bed in the evening at 23 o'clock, I still have between 15% and 25% battery. with the already installed iOS 11, the command center has been reworked, and you can configure it yourself. I see this as a big advantage because I can choose what I need and what I do not. Screen and back are covered with a grease-repellent layer that makes fingerprints less noticeable. Compared to the Galaxy S8 of my girlfriend, I can even confirm this. For me it is a disadvantage that Apple renounces the iPhone 7 and now the 8 on the jack connection. I use my iPhone while driving a car as a navigation device, and I also hear music via the iPhone. With my 6 Series, I was able to connect the AUX cable and charge the device at the same time. This is now only possible via special accessories, for which you also have to spend money again. the quick charge function on the iPhone 8 is also only accessible if you're ready to spend another good 90 ¬ for power supply and charging cable. At the end I would like to say that I do not regret the change to the new generation, because you just notice how old my iPhone 6 became. I am very excited about the speed of the 8 Plus, and it has been well worth it for that alone.	1
I'm very happy with my new iphon 8Plus in gold. Delivery was quick and in gold it looks very noble. Can only recommend it.	1
After switching from 5s to 8plus, the addiction to hold the device and paddle has increased even further ...	1
Not much to say. I upgraded from a 7+ to this. Basically the same but faster. Great phone too a great price.	1
I bought this iPhone used, great price and can say how surprised I was when unpacking, like new, impeccable. It corresponds exactly to my ideas.	1
Super quality and as usual Apple very chic. I would buy again and again.	1
Apple is just Apple, I'm fully convinced. Since the iPhone 6, which I own, a lot has happened, especially with regard to the camera	1
It’s nice and it’s original, I love my iPhone 8plus. It came on time without delay	1
Very well	1
Since I had my old iPhone 5s about 4 years in use and the battery performance is more than exhausted, I bought the iPhone 8 Plus just under a month ago. Now I would like to share my experiences with you, maybe they are helpful for one or the other in the purchase decision:) DESIGN: The design is not really different from its predecessors. Only the back is made of glass, so a wireless charging is possible. The smartphone is processed as usual perfectly and is very good in the hand. In addition, the display jumps immediately when you pick it up and I'm really excited about this feature. The camera on the back of the phone is a bit out, which personally but not bother me. The frame is dull but somehow shiny. All in all, the iPhone 8 plus offers a very high-quality impression. The screen is 5.5 inches tall and is also dissolved in FullHD. It offers very nice bright colors and even in direct sunlight, I can read the display still good. PERFORMANCE: In my opinion, the performance of this smartphone can hardly be exceeded. It reacts lightning fast and the reaction speed is really phenomenal. Test results have also shown that Apple hereby offers the fastest mobile phone on the market. This is not only due to the strong Apple A11 processor, but also the excellent balance of hardware and software. With this performance, everything is possible on this phone, I often run several apps at the same time and I have never had problems : The battery life is very good. In a 10h train journey I had the smartphone almost the whole way in operation (have watched series, surfed the Internet etc ...) and even here was the battery is not completely empty. However, I noticed that it actually takes a little longer to recharge (just over 3 hours). Personally, this does not bother me, but I usually charge it overnight. If you do not want to, you can replace the standard Apple battery charger with one that offers more watts. Wireless charging: The iPhone 8 Plus now also offers wireless charging according to the Qi standard. Here I had to wait but 4 hours until my iPhone was fully charged. CAMERA: The concise dual camera is located on the back of the iPhone. It offers 12 megapixels and thus a very good picture quality, which inspires me again and again. The pictures look really high quality and the portrait function was convincing. Objects in the foreground of the picture are even more strongly lifted off the background. (I'll attach different motives, so you can better imagine the quality of the camera.) I was already very excited about the camera with my old 5s iPhone, but this exceeds the quality of the images again by far. The iPhone 8 Plus also offers a slow-motion feature that gives you a slightly different look at things you know. Here, Apple relies on a high full HD resolution with up to 240 frames per second.FAZIT: For some iPhone fans, the new 8 Plus may seem boring, but since I have switched from my 5S directly to this here, I discovered many innovations. iPhone offers hereby a high quality mobile phone in excellent processing with strong battery, excellent performance and excellent camera. The iPhone 8 Plus is undoubtedly a Topsmartphone, but the competition from its own market should be strong. Let's see if I can resist his successor :)	1
Is my first Iphone, so have no comparisons to previous models. Great photos, great outfit, great service and for me a super battery characterize the device. Since I already owned an iPad I know myself with the controls. The ICloud makes the interaction between both devices perfect.	1
Fast delivery - earlier than announced.iPhone 8plus is exactly the description.	1
Package - after e-mail from Amazon arrived much earlier than originally stated !!	1
Everything as described! The phone is white and there are no problems with the software. I can only recommend	1
Finally, I can write a review here, even if I have not bought the phone here. This will not be a technical review, but there is the datasheet and I think because you know yourself anyway in advance over it. I had the Iphone 7 in Rose before. I already loved that, when I switched from Samsung to IOS. The beginning time was difficult but meanwhile I do not like to miss IOS any more. Since the 7 he was too small for me, I have now switched to the Iphone 8 Plus. First of all, I did not want, because there was no pink in the series of 8 more. However, I find that this golden looks exactly like Pink. Even now after some time I am glad to have decided for the golden version. The edge is as mentioned pink and by the beige back cover in glass it looks really noble. The phone is slightly heavier than the 7 Plus, here I had reservations. But I can completely blur this, after only 1 day I got used to it. Now it seems to me not so big, only if I have a little miss, I still notice the size. The service is great, as usual from IOS. It makes great photos, especially the panorama function, I loved skiing again. Despite its size, it can still be quickly put in your pocket. Super is the stronger battery. While I had to load the 7er every day, I get along with the same use already for 2 days. That's great if I forgot to load it. An absolute top stop for me. I can only recommend it absolutely, I'm glad that I switched from the 7th. Clear buy recommendation from me.	1
I have to say I had only the Samsung s4mini, samsung s5 and the iPhone 6s so far and was curious how the new iPhone will be, I had a few concerns because I had heard that there was little difference to the 6s but where I had the 8 plus and compared it with the 6s I have to say it's just nice differences there: -Kamara is extremely good design with the glass backside being extremely nice-for me the size is also really nice-the phone is just totally fast-the battery lasts longer-the phone is louder-wireless charching (cable charging) i can definitely recommend buying	1
The 8PLUS is very fast with the new chip. It runs without problems. The camera is excellent, you just have to deal with the instructions from Apple, then you get top recordings. The rest, software, operation, processing and speed is really impressive. Have changed 3 years ago from Android because the system after 1 year slower and slower. Apple no problem.	1
The iPhone 8/8 PLUS makes sense especially when upgraded from a 5 or 6 model. I myself had the 6 plus before, with which I was also completely satisfied. But since a contract extension was due, I have deliberately decided for the 8 Plus, and not for the X. The difference from the 6 Plus to the 8 Plus is immense. Thanks to the new A11 processor, the smartphone is brutally fast. A real monster. I've never experienced that at such a speed before. Every application opens almost instantaneously. The camera in the 8 Plus is total madness. Even 3-4 years ago, I would not have thought it possible that a smartphone camera would offer such a quality. The photos are quite worthy of a DSLR camera. The prerequisite is, of course, always that you also know how to deal with a camera. And with the video function you can now synonymous 4K / 60fps recordings, thus the 8 Series models and the iPhone X are currently the only smartphones on the market, with which this is possible. 4K / 60fps recordings are otherwise not even possible with 2000-3000 ¬ expensive SLR cameras. And all that for your pocket. If you had a 6 before, the difference to the 8 is a real quantum leap. And if you like the classic iPhone design with homebutton, touch screen and the well-tried swipe gestures like I do, then the 8 is the only reasonable alternative to the iPhone X, which I find too expensive. Since I'm on the plus models and there is not the X in the Plus version, it comes to me anyway out of the question. The iPhone has come to perfection with the iPhone 8/8 Plus. Never before has everything harmonized so well in an iPhone. Everything runs absolutely smooth, round and smooth and at a rapid pace. With the iPhone X, a new iPhone era begins. The device has many teething problems and is far from mature. On the contrary. For me, the X is almost a trial iPhone, a beta phone and it will be years before it will be as perfect as the 8 Series is now. All of this (and much more) has been the reason for me to choose the 8 Plus. For me personally not only the best iPhone ever, but also the best smartphone ever. A real high-end / tech multi-media machine of the finest quality.	1
The iPhone8 plus has met exactly my expectation. Price performance is right, the device has the usual Apple quality, super fast and user-friendly with the latest IOS 11, great features, cloud-based data exchange with other Apple devices are just unique.	1
I use the phone 14 months a day have a € 10 case (transparent) and a bulletproof glass (3stk also about 10 €). And it has so far not a single scratch the phone is running perfectly, it is fast, battery top, picture quality top! Do not regret a penny (909 €). Will certainly last the next few years without any problems, and in the end you can even sell it well.	1
Had a 6 plus before. So far completely satisfied. More memory was important to me. I'm looking forward to the made photos if the camera is really better. Unfortunately there is no big difference to the 6er visually. Otherwise Apple stop	1
I am already over 60 and smartphone entry-level. I looked at different models. Since we have a MacBook Pro and my wife has the same model, I decided to do it. A small drawback is the high price.	1
I've made the change from the iPhone 6 16GB to the iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB because I've lost noticeably in performance and speed. With the 8 Plus you're technically up to date again, the speed is great, the performance and the general tuning just super. Optically, the iPhone 8 has hardly changed its predecessors. The back is now made of glass, which on the one hand is very nice to look at, but on the other hand again a potential weak point and repairs to the glass are the Risiko.Apple used in the iPhone 8 and the 8 plus the A11 Bionic chip, which all other opponents in the Shadow poses. the camera is probably one of the highlights of the new IPhone 8 Plus.

I see this as a big advantage because I can choose what I need and what I do not. Screen and back are covered with a grease-repellent layer that makes fingerprints less noticeable. Compared to the Galaxy S8 of my girlfriend, I can even confirm this. For me it is a disadvantage that Apple renounces the iPhone 7 and now the 8 on the jack connection. I use my iPhone while driving a car as a navigation device, and I also hear music via the iPhone. With my 6 Series, I was able to connect the AUX cable and charge the device at the same time. This is now only possible via special accessories, for which you also have to spend money again. the quick charge function on the iPhone 8 is also only accessible if you're ready to spend another good 90 ¬ for power supply and charging cable. At the end I would like to say that I do not regret the change to the new generation, because you just notice how old my iPhone 6 became. I am very excited about the speed of the 8 Plus, and it has been well worth it for that alone.	1
The iPhone is the perfection of the previous models. The workmanship, the glass back it fits everything. Battery keeps me 2.Days and I use the iPhone quite often for social media, YouTube, etc. And typical IOS is, it runs and runs and, above all, runs smoothly. The camera is great and the pictures have a realistic color representation, which is not the case with many other smartphones. I can only recommend the iPhone.	1
It's all so good the last real iPhone before the x price like all apple products just a bit high otherwise top	1
The iPhone 8 Plus is a top device. I've owned Samsung smartphones for many years, including the latest ones like S7 Edge, S8, S8Plus, Note 8 ... I've tested all of them and in the meantime for a few months iPhone models (6s Plus, 7 Plus). After me the Note 8 had now extensively tested, I have found for me that the Samsung Time has expired once for me. Not least because of the bad battery life of the note 8. For the price unacceptable. I was convinced u. a. the iPhone 8 Plus the design (yes, it looks like its predecessor, but that's exactly what I think is great). The quality is perfect! Soft- and hardware ... are perfectly matched, this is also noticeable in the battery life While the note 8 with moderate use and a bit of luck managed a day, my iPhone keeps very loose 2 days ... It inspires me every time again! Camera The camera is great! Currently one of the best smartphone cameras you can get in the market. The thing is really fun! What I've noticed very clearly: Your iPhone is really an honest smartphone. While me in selfie shots a Note 8 from Samsung has always hammered such a nice blur in the face, so yes all tippi toppi looks like, no wrinkles, no dark circles (not even after a 10 hour party or stressful 50-hour week ) my iPhone is quite different. After shooting the first few selfies, I was horrified. No blur - just the brutal reality. For some selfies, I briefly considered whether I should really leave the apartment. That's sometimes a bit hard ... But let's face it, who wants to be fooled around on the other side? My iPhone has clearly taught me to think carefully before, if I'm mentally able to, now really a Make selfie. It could happen that my good mood is shredded within a second. Charging the battery takes 2-3 hours, but that does not bother me. Who wants to get a quick charge cable? Buy device, the 8 Plus and the iPhone X support Qi and inductive charging. The points that should have a smartphone for me, are all given here. And in a super quality and technical Ausstattung.SpeicherIch have the 64 GB version, which is absolutely sufficient for me. I currently have about 60 apps, 600 pictures, a few videos, about 25 hours of music, offline navigation .... and just about 14 GB consumed ... But who films a lot, plays many games and everything else on the mobile carries with it should possibly to the large 256 GB version griff.FAZIT: Clear Buy recommendation!	1
I bought the Iphone 8Plus after having to hand over the Iphone X again. So I will not talk about the Iphone 8Plus, but explain the differences between the 5.5 "and 5.8". It's a great smartphone Compact in the hand, is very clean processed, offers according to Apple a 5.8 "large screen, of which one, however, due to the screen format only when reading websites has a greater advantage over the 16: 9 screens! Watch videos like Youtube on, the X is not the first choice. The Iphone X is unlocked by Face ID, which usually works smoothly. In addition, both rear cameras are equipped with an optical image stabilizer, so overall a top mobile phone with small weaknesses when viewing videos (hardly larger than the 4.7-inch model). Why have I now exchanged the X for the Iphone 8 Plus? The reason is the following: The Iphone X has caused me head and eye pain! As I researched more closely, I came to the following answer: It is partly due to the OLED - display, which works with a kind of pulse width modulation to darken the display and the relatively slow oscillations (240HZ) can lead to eye and headaches, and the other is Face-ID (attention checking), which regularly emits UV rays. The incredible thing is that I do not seem to be the only one with this problem, just give it "Eyestrain with Iphone X" at Google and will be amazed that the Iphone X causes many users problems. All these factors have me almost to 8 Plus which offers an almost equally good camera, has the faster and more reliable Touch ID button and is able to display 16: 9 content on the entire display. I owned it before (without X) the Iphone 6S Plus and can also say In total, the Iphone X gets 1 star from me because it is harmful to my health (flickering, UV rays) and the Iphone 8 Plus 5 stars, even if it is not so compact.	1
The iPhone was even earlier than Amazon announced to my surprise. I'm very happy with it. I can only recommend	1
I switched from the iPhone 6S Plus to the 8 Plus and do not regret it in any way. Yes, almost 1000 € are a lot of money for a smartphone, but you also get a lot for your money ... if you know what you want! In my household are various Apple devices, such as MacBooks, an iMac, an Apple TV and various airplay-enabled speakers and an Apple Watch and hi-fi components. What you have to leave Apple - the connection to a given infrastructure in the "" Apple Cosmos "" is terrific, iCloud for me is always the "" killer feature "" because data exchanged very quickly and documents from one device to another first-class Yes, the display design is "" stale "", but thanks to the display edges you still have something to "hold on" to and look (for example, while looking a Youtube video) is not covered by the fingers (as it is the case with the Galaxy S8 / Note 8). 1080p are also perfect. The workmanship is typically Apple-typical and the glass back feels terrific. Wireless charging also works with Case. The speed of the iPhone 8 is just brutal. This is undoubtedly the currently fastest processor in a cell phone, no matter whether photo editing, games, multitasking - everything runs easy. The first impression of the camera is breathtaking, but it could test only a short time and only a few "" test shots "" make. In this regard, I will attach some sample images of the camera. Now a highly recommended smartphone for the buyer, who knows what he wants. I would buy it again and can recommend it without hesitation.	1
The iPhone 8/8 PLUS makes sense especially when upgraded from a 5 or 6 model. I myself had the 6 plus before, with which I was also completely satisfied. But since a contract extension was due, I have deliberately decided for the 8 Plus, and not for the X. The difference from the 6 Plus to the 8 Plus is immense. Thanks to the new A11 processor, the smartphone is brutally fast. I've never experienced that before. Every application opens almost instantaneously. The camera in the 8 Plus is total madness. Even 3-4 years ago, I would not have thought it possible that a smartphone camera would offer such a quality. The photos are quite worthy of a DSLR camera. And with the video function you can now synonymous 4K / 60fps recordings, thus the 8 Series models and the iPhone X are currently the only smartphones on the market, with which this is possible. 4K / 60fps recordings are otherwise not even with 2000-3000 ¬ expensive SLR cameras möglich.Wenn previously had a 6er is the difference to the 8er a real quantum leap. And if you like the classic iPhone design with Homebutton and the well-tried swiping gestures like me, then the 8 is the only reasonable alternative to the iPhone X, which I find too expensive. And since I'm on the plus models and there is not X in the Plus version, it is for me anyway out of the question. The iPhone has come to perfection with the iPhone 8/8 Plus. Never before has everything harmonized so well in an iPhone. Everything runs smoothly, fast and faultless. With the iPhone X, a new iPhone era begins. The device still has many teething problems and is far from mature. On the contrary. For me, the X is almost a trial iPhone, a beta phone, and it will be years before it will be as perfect as the 8 Series is. All of this (and much more) has been the reason for me to choose the 8 Plus. For me personally not only the best iPhone ever, but also the best smartphone ever. A truly phenomenal device.	1
Have the device just under a month in use and am very satisfied. Previously had the 6s Plus, which was still a top smartphone, but me the camera of the 8 Plus, the chip and all the benefits that there has been since the 7 Plus, enticed.Have also considered the iPhone X to buy, but here I have the even more expensive price, the omission of the Touch ID and also the rare scarcity an argument against the purchase been. The 8 Plus at least does what it should. The display with True Tone I find just super natural of the colors and very sharp, the camera is one of the best smartphone cameras on the market and the benchmark atomized anyway any Android Phone. The processing is first class as usual. Especially the new glass back is terrific. Battery life for me much better to my old. Some describe the design as stale. It may be, but I call it classic and I like it very much. But in 2 years at the latest, I'll probably say goodbye. Until then, I can only fully recommend the 8 Plus.	1
I've made the change from the iPhone 6 16GB to the iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB because I've lost noticeably in performance and speed. With the 8 Plus you're technically up to date again, the speed is great, the performance and the general tuning just super. Optically, the iPhone 8 has hardly changed its predecessors. The back is now made of glass, which on the one hand is very nice to look at, but on the other hand again a potential weak point and repairs to the glass are the Risiko.Apple used in the iPhone 8 and the 8 plus the A11 Bionic chip, which all other opponents in the Shadow poses. the camera is probably one of the highlights of the new IPhone 8 Plus. It has a 12 MP dual camera and a 7 MP front camera. There is a lot possible here. 4K recordings, portrait mode and live photos are a few keywords. Of course, Touch ID is also on board again, this will not be the case with the iPhone X anymore. For me, this was a reason not to take the iPhone X, but rather the 8 Plus, since I got so used to Touch ID. The battery should according to the manufacturer, similar to the 7 Plus, allow about 21 hours of talk time, up to 13 hours of Internet use, 14 hours of video playback and 60 hours of audio playback. Of course, I have not done these tests in practice, but I can say that the battery lasts all day, I leave the house in the morning at 7, and when I go to bed in the evening at 23 o'clock, I still have between 15% and 25% battery. with the already installed iOS 11, the command center has been reworked, and you can configure it yourself.

At the end I would like to say that I do not regret the change to the new generation, because you just notice how old my iPhone 6 became. I am very excited about the speed of the 8 Plus, and it has been well worth it for that alone.	1
Fast, persistent, high-quality, top-processed, super display, best camera, iOS. There's nothing more to say about that. A great thing. Recommended!	1
Finally it is there .., it was speculated and talked a lot about it! From the outside it does not look much different than its predecessor, where I find the look noble, minimalist, classically perfect and why change a lot if it is perfect! Again, Apple has managed to excel and I also think that the changes are more drastic than between the last iPhones! But you have to test it yourself! The camera performance with the effects is sensational and the display, the graphics and the colors are really terrific. Also the sound is a lot better. The battery has been massively improved, but of course it is still better The apps and the menu is running like sliced ​​bread.The operation is as easy as any iPhone so it is also suitable for seniors or people who do not care much with high tec! Well the price is steep, but knows You rarely buy an iPhone just because you want to make a phone call, but because it's just a kind of status symbol and I have to say I love it and for me it says ... once iPhone always iPhone!	1
I have not bought the iphone 8 Plus at Amazon, but I write after 4 days of use my review here. The iphone 8 Plus I bought in silver, it is top processed, with the back of glass, it looks very chic and feels It is also very good, it is not as slippery as the iPhone 6 Plus or 6S plus, 7 plus. The operating system is smooth and 100% secure. Why I did not opt ​​for the iphone X? Because of the missing homebutton, the ugly bar on the iphone X. Processing 100% TopDisplay 100% TopPower 100%. Top camera 95% very goodAccumulator 95% Very good about 10-12 hoursListenspeaker 96% Very goodIQ loading very convenientWho wants to have a solid top smartphone and IOS like, can access without hesitation.	1
Beautifully more you need not say the glass side noble and in gold not to toppen.Handhabung and operation butter soft and with iOS 11 outstanding. Bought somewhere else but you have to judge something synonymous.	1
Everything is very well packed fast delivery	1
I deliberately bought the iPhone 8 Plus because I like the home button better than FaceID of the iPhone XS or XR. I like the size very much.	1
The product arrived even before the delivery date! The Iphone 7 was ORIGINAL packed including everything that belongs to it, welded in and also the check of the serial number showed that it is NEW! Works super fast without any mistakes! Battery capacity 100%! I am satisfied from the ground up!	1
Although no Apple warranty more on it but much cheaper than Apple. Was originally packed with all accessories. Generally a very good phone with good battery life and has almost all the features like the 8 Series.	1

I bought the iPhone 7 because my HTC one M8 broke. I am very satisfied with my iPhone. The workmanship is high quality, the picture quality is very good, the camera is synonymous really great. I have intentionally bought the iPhone 7 and not the iPhone 8, since it is the last model with a metal back cover (IPhone 8 back cover -> glass). The computing power is also not significantly worse for the new model. Clear buy recommendation for the iPhone 7, because you can still save a lot here in return for the iPhone 8, without added value.	1
Have as described a brand new iPhone received. IPhone has never been used or somehow processed. Also, the model is intended for the European market. As usual, top quality Apple. Absolutely top price.	1
fast delivery, everything okay. Mobile phone was summoned. To the phone is also the USB RCA adapter, which is required for the iPhone 7 for normal headphones, only the Sim card needle was a bit verstcket between the slips	1
Had the iPhone 6s and now the iPhone 7. I am very satisfied, but I do not feel much difference between the 6s and the 7, except the battery life, which is better than the 6s. The delivery ran flawlessly and super fast!	1
The iphone came within a week, pretty soon after I commissioned it. The smartphone was packed as expected and had no damage. I still use it and I have to say that I am very satisfied and can recommend the purchase.	1
The iPhone 7 has arrived punctually in the original packaging, everything should be like. One should immediately order a protective cover, since the smartphone is relatively heavy, smooth and thin, so that it can easily slip out of hand	1
Ordered Monday morning, received Tuesday morning - wow! Since the article is needed, you have to expect one or the other Macke or scratches, inasmuch as the condition of the phone is acceptable. From the technical side, I could not find any defects so far, everything does as it should. Touchscreen, fingerprint scanner, loudspeaker, everything is working properly. If I fall again a cell phone in the toilet, I will definitely buy my next here again! A small note: the adapter for lightning to aux was missing in the delivery. I do not need him and I do not even know if he should have been there. But maybe an important info for another customer.	1
My cell phone arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The handling is as expected, simply top, picture quality leaves nothing to be desired.	1
I chose this purchase because it was the cheapest deal I could find for an iPhone 7 in my favorite 128gb color. Super fast delivery! Within 2 days it was already there. Original welded. The iPhone does what it promises and looks really chic. Buy recommendation!	1
Ordered for my girlfriend as a birthday present. She is enthusiastic after a few weeks of use of the iPhone 7! The price was right, so what more could you ask for!	1
The device is very nice, sturdy and has many features.I recommend to buy the device and enjoy the many features	1
Since my predecessor was also an iPhone and I needed a new one, of course I decided for one again and would not buy another brand anymore	1
I ordered the iPhone 7 in Rosegold on 02.02.18 via A-Montain and am very satisfied. The goods arrived as promised the next day and everything was packed perfectly. Packaging was completely sealed. NEW ordered and also received NEW. Everything perfect!	1
Delivery without problems. I do not have to say anything about an iPhone 7, it usually just erupts again. Who decides to Apple, knows what he gets.	1
shipping faster; price-performance fits; an iphone just, what can you say, my wife likes it and he switched from 4s to this was already huge ;-)	1
Fast and easy delivery. I am very satisfied with the iPhone 7! High-quality construction, very fast operating system. I was an Android user before, but the transition was surprisingly easy!	1
Top cell phone. You do not have to lose anymore.	1
Everything was great, after a long time thinking, I finally stopped here and was not disappointed. 1A new, sealed, not on the Apple Black List. At this top price, you have to be aware of getting a device that was sold to the Eastern European market. Functionally, however, there are no restrictions	1
Delivery received very quickly. Mobile phone in very good condition, no scratches, no quirks. Very slight signs of wear on the screen. Highly recommended!	1
Handy is impeccable I as an Apple Fan Can not complainI hope only it lasts a bit longer than my iPhone 5sThis was broken after 2.5 years and could not be repairedCPU defective	1
Is very good in the hand. The processor works fast so the apps are loaded in a very short time.	1
The iphone is, as usual from apple, very well processed. It has a fast processor and a high resolution camera. The mobile phone is really fun	1
Like all apple products the iPhone 7 is easy to understand and to use just like using an iPad that fits in your pocket.money well spent	1
The iPhone arrived quickly and was undamaged. Everything went super.	1
I recently ordered the iPhone 7 in gold from the seller A-Montain and I am very satisfied. Package arrived as promised and the packaging of the smartphone was completely sealed, as well as the phone with film and the accessories also completely new. So it was never open. Also, a review of the serial number on Apple has shown that this Iphone has never been activated. Have ordered it NEW and also received NEW. Everything super! Just got a bill from A-Montain requested. If this arrives in the next few days, I am desperately happy. EDIT: The requested invoice arrived on the same evening by mail! Conclusion: really desireless Happy!	1
I bought the iPhone 7 as a replacement for my old 5C. Can say that I can recommend it to all Apple fans.	1
everything as described	1
Ordered, Delivered, UnpackedWhat should I say the iphone is visually really new. Have it set up, it is running very well so far!	1
So with me everything went as planned and previously said regarding delivery etc., although a bit long with 5 days of delivery but well known is the anticipation is the most beautiful ;-) Everything as it should be, the 7 was completely new welded and inside in the package, in terms of some recessions are where the iPhone was missing! I have to say that I have between the iPhone 6s I once dared to the other side and I got the Samsung S8! Phew yeah what should I say for me, Apple ever Apple !! I notice again, how great the system and processing around the device works is the hammer, because Samsung or any other manufacturer in my opinion, never and never keep up! Battery has been improved a lot to 6s, camera, and I find 3D Touch also very useful! Speed ​​of the apps and everything around it anyway (top) !!!! ...... One of the most important things was that the fingerprint sits back in front! That's a disaster at the S8 up there next to the camera. And besides, I could not cope with the aspect ratio at all !!! So what you get out of my recession is that I'm extremely excited about iPhone 7 and "" for me "" is the best smartphone on the market !! But that's everyone's taste and how he likes to handle it! Aja the dealer was from Topprice 24, if I have written him correctly now! ;-) came from Madrid the device-so 5 days delivery !! But everything completely new, so from me nothing to complain about !!! Lg ;-)	1
had no scratches and delivery time was very short	1
Buy Used "" Apple iPhone 7 Smartphone "". Can I only recommend, because at amazon good providers with service and warranty minimize the risk for a used device. Processing and delivery optimal. A small note about the "" Apple iPhone 7 Smartphone (11.9 cm (4.7 inches), 128GB of internal memory, iOS 10) matte black "". As an Apple user, I have gained my experience with iPhone 4, 5 and SE. After the SE as last development, after the 7er, I still chose the 7 as described. Pleasant is the larger display. All other innovations are well communicated. Whether progress or disadvantage ultimately has to be decided by the user. The handling through the rounded edge of the case takes a bit of getting used to, but users of the 6 Series have become accustomed to it. I find two things disturbing. Once the location of the home button right side in the upper area, is often disturbing in the photo function. Second, the omission of the 3.5 mm jack for the headphones appears to be a problem at the beginning. But the Apple original headphones with Lightning connector instead of the latch actuator, simply solves the problem. However, if the AUX function for other purposes wireless is not sufficient, has invested in an adapter. After iPad, MacBook, iMac and Co. is for me personally wireless announced.	1
You have to give the sellers bad reviews, not the product. The iPhone itself is not scrap, just because you wanted to make a special bargain and fell for it. A particularly cheap price and an unknown seller is there but a good indication. The Rolex from the beach certainly has no guarantee.	1
Super quality as used by Apple. I think the camera of the iPhone 7 is particularly great, the pictures are beautiful. Also, I am thrilled, as always! Clear Buy recommendation.	1
Was better than described. There were even headphones and everything was like new. There was only a small mini scratch on the display, but in the condition Acceptable I would have imagined it much worse. I would recommend again and again	1
it does exactly what it's supposed to give the quality nothing to shake price performance Top and Amazon is shopping WITHOUT RISK is always the best STEP !! CUSTOMER SERVICE 1 must I go here once !!!!!	1
bought and found to be very good. After 6 years of experience (4S, 5S, SE, 7, Ipad2, Ipad Air 2, Ipad Pro 1. 12.9 ""). What annoying? you can not put the phone to film anymore, it just turns around ...	1
After my IP6 is now 3 years old, it was time for something new used. The 16 GB memory reached its limits. After all, I am convinced of Apple. The IP7 with 128GB memory is faster and delivers better pictures than the 6er. For my use the right decision. Me (58) Electrician is still working and does not always have to be "on". The battery lasts for three days. At night and in the office on power-saving mode, it works. Nice toy for technology lovers. Since yesterday I have learned that you can also call it. That should have gone with the IP6 already? In that sense, the Nokia 3210 can finally retire, ahead of me! ;-)	1
The iPhone was at the time of purchase, the latest on the market (before 8 and 10), have given it to my wife. The background was that she got an Apple Watch 2 at Christmas 2016 and I did not know that it works exclusively with Apple products. At first I was angry and wanted to give the watch back, but then decided otherwise. It may be that certain Android smartphones are "better" in technical terms (camera e.tc.), but overall the iPhone is very convincing and a really great device. Also the shipping was smooth with fast and secure delivery.	1
I like my iPhone and after my old one has been holding for 4 years, it has been allowed to make a new one. Of course, it is known not the cheapest mobile phone on the market but that should be well known by now.	1
was really skeptical at the beginning if everything worked out as it was partly written here. I also read the recessions in which it was described that no devices have arrived. but has to say everything worked out great even faster than stated.	1
What can you say, very well, as expected. You have to get used to Android, but not complicated. Very good workmanship. Delivery faster than expected.	1
I bought for the first time in iphone and am extremely satisfied, everything can be stable and extremely fast. plays all the games you want and looks simple and elegant. Processing also top !!	1
Delivery includes an original packaged device. But there is no German user manual, which personally disturbed me nic.	1
I belong to the first group. So, who cares: this thing is a force: fast, sharp, good sound ... mature design ....	1
The cell phone is original packed in foil arrived. The shipping took a little longer, which is a pity but was aware in advance. The only thing that was a bit stupid that the expensive thing was given to a neighbor ... I'm not sure how it would be if I had no confidence in my neighbor, but to say positive I could do it right in the same day Even with questions, the support is very helpful, so after a few days my e-mail has already been processed Value for money is unbeatable, thank you	1
After extensive testing, I can only recommend the Iphone 7. I am completely satisfied with this product, but I have to say that the battery caused me the biggest worry in the beginning. However, I could convince myself that the battery is not as weak as it is shown on some pages, but can compete with the current smartphones in the market kann.Die camera of the iPhone is in my opinion very satisfactory and the design of the smartphone is also very convincing. The display and sound of the speakers and the call quality need not hide from the competition of Samsung etc. The price is deterrent, but IOS 10 offers many new and improved things that justify it. In conclusion, it can be said that the Iphone 7 is a good smartphone, which I strongly recommend.	1
Actually 4.5 star top smartphone with small disadvantages Despite the top equipment! Mobile is very fast and makes a very good impression!	1
What should one say big about this? Well-known quality expected from Apple. Top product. Makes fun every day. Super.	1
Perfect protection. Super handling. Class service. I would buy the product again at any time. Also good that two glasses are sent along.	1
a great phone, good and easy to use, very good camera, very nice color, good size. Can I only recommend.	1
I confess, before I bought this iPhone for the proud price, I had to think it over several nights exactly if I really wanted to spend 800 ¬ for a cell phone. You could just as well have planned a short break for the family for the money or give a car to a driver. But I thought that one could also be totally off the socks and do what you are thought to be crazy or crazy. So I bought this iPhone.Vorne away: I was already an iPhone 5c owner. I had ordered it after the apprenticeship even for 480 € as well as Amazon, because the competition MM or red Planet did not consider it necessary to get their prices under control and therefore I am Amazon my money in the throat. I have never regretted anything. Shipping and the device were first class. I had the iPhone 5c now more than 3 1/2 years in my own possession and noticed after the big IOS 10 updates that it takes my 5c but too much. Do not get me wrong, everything went really smoothly or crashes, but now and then the iPhone had its minutes of silence because the animations had to load longer than the text. And then I realized clearly the device is slowly reaching its technical limits. So I decided for a new iPhone. (Android is fine, but has its advantages, but not nearly as mature as IOS). I rummaged on Amazon several times whether it should be a 6 or a 6s. The 6er fell out because of the age again, because I had only the 6s left. (Until then, the new 7 Series was released, but priced really a limb). So after 1 month I went to MM again and looked at the device one more time. I was disturbed directly by these funny antenna strips on the back, which could have been solved elegantly by Apple, or the designer was probably at this time on treatment or had a long-term holiday. However, I fell in love with the very beautiful black front, which was impeccably finished. In addition to the new iPhone 7 was already issued and I flirted briefly. At this moment I was really amazed how chic the matte 7er but with the shifted antenna strip looked. But the good piece had its good price. After that, I looked home on Youtube for the first hands-on of the new 7 Series and the older reviews of the 6S. Technically, both were not too far apart, each device had its shortcoming. Then it grabbed me and I wanted to look at Amazon on how high the prices for the device are. And I was amazed once again about the exaggerated MM pricing policy and that of the competition "Amazon". (It should be said, MM gets you the next 12 weeks, no device, they buy only every 2 weeks 30 devices and these are directly assigned.But since MM probably did not respond to the huge demand and then ordered several devices, I would imaginary the stinky finger against this shop and against this snotty MM seller who probably had his day on this day). Amazon has just created a monopoly where good customer service, top shipping and products have found their place.So the madness grabbed me and I ordered the device in the 128GB version. The 16GB of my 5c's was really too small in the long run. Here is a video, as a few vacation photos and a few useful apps (which have really immense sizes under IOS) and from the available storage space of 12.3 were only 3GB. Clearly too little if one plans to continue shooting vacations or videos. So I made up for the last bad buy a little bit. The device was ordered on Monday evening and was already there Wednesday morning. (Without Amazon Prime probably noticed) In contrast, MM could really pack only. I grabbed it then, straight out and amazed again: If there would be smartphone pornography, Apple would have earned its golden nose. The device and the accessories were really elegant and perfectly packed. (Please do not understand me as an Apple lover / fanboy but I'm packaging industry and this high-quality packaging has its price) In this point, just anyone can not make Apple what! Device was removed and of course I as an old game hare, had to turn it directly. These 4.7 inches made something in contrast to the 4 inch screens from 2013. Much more saturated & brighter colors and much more pleasant for the Augen.Also the old Nano Sim card was taken immediately (yes, this device still has the Nano SIM card slot like the 5 Series) and plugged into the 7th. Incidentally, a backup was played on iTunes to continue to use current data from the 5c to the 7 loss-free. After the backup was transferred to the 7, I played directly with the new camera around. The new optical image stabilizer is a true dream and was long overdue, but he worked first class. In terms of performance, it was day and night between the two devices. The 7er flits without making any mischief through the menus or the Safari Explorer as there is no tomorrow. I really noticed how much my 5c was claimed by IOS 10. No wonder with only 1GB Ram and 1.3 dual core processor had their best days long behind .... Well after another 2 weeks with the device, I have not regretted the purchase of the device. Even if the purchase price was pretty heavy at first. However, it must be remembered that development costs for updates and the technology of the device also flow into the purchase price. Of course, Apple also earns a fair share of the rest, but the poor managers still earn too little! : o) I will shoot after the first half of the device with a few updates afterwards. And for all new customers who intend to buy an iPhone, always buys a larger storage variant. A better repurchase value & a greater benefit reward you in the future with the device.	1
I ordered the iPhone from RH Mobiles - the provider changes very often and fast here - and I can only say: I'm thrilled! The iPhone arrived 2 weeks faster than stated, say after 2 days! It was originally packed and with German instructions! I can only recommend	1
The delivery was there within 3 days. It is complete and after my first assessment, the iPhone is fully functional. So I can highly recommend it. Especially since it is offered much cheaper here, as in the media market z. B.	1
Although I already ordered a lot about Amazon but here I am very unsure if I should actually make the order over the Internet. Fear was whether the goods actually arrives, in what condition and whether it is an original. Have even opened packaging under the eyes of the postman to have a witness if carton should be empty or similar fears should prove true.So end good all good.Handy came on time. Device corresponds to the original which was bought in Austria. (Have both placed next to each other and one: one compared. Color, size, thickness, functions = ident Menu navigation worked immediately in German Handy is impeccable and works even after a month in the operation excellent Am of course curious if it stays that way or how Apple or dealer in case of a defect would react.For the packaging is not much to say was sufficient.Phone is unlocked.It was impeccably recognized by two different providers simcards immediately.Various apps are supported.Web Internet and mail forwarding work.The setting went virtually by itself .Preissparnis still pretty high. Especially if you should consider with a sim card with a cheap provider and the savings there.With an often overpriced tariff, the phone is indeed paid twice and that even with years of binding.Can say with relief: So actually buying recommended.	1
Have my iphone already 2 years umd it still runs flawlessly. The battery is still durable and the software runs efficiently and very well. The camera makes super nice pictures. I'm still very satisfied!	1
Am a total iPhone fan and thus it has done to me the iPhone 7. I am very pleased. It is similar to the iPhone 6s, but I'm still happy about the iPhone 7.	1
Yes, there is not much to say until it is a great smartphone. Of course, tastes are different but with the iPhone 7 you can basically go wrong. It is always worth the money. Unfortunately there were delivery problems but that has nothing to do with the product.	1
I have used the iPhone 6s for a year and have now intensively tested the iPhone 7 for several days. I will describe in detail my experiences in comparison to the previous generation and update the test in the future. For questions just in the comments report. If I helped in the purchase decision, I would be in return on a like look! Optics iPhone 7 looks essentially like the 6 or 6s. Only the antenna strips on the back are a little inconspicuous designed and the camera nubs is now no longer like a porthole out, but was filigree incorporated into the case (I think the pictures show the differences quite well). From the processing, the smartphone is top, you can expect this price but also. Incidentally, I myself use a protective cover, because I'm always scared of dropping it at the rounded corners. In addition, the diamond-black variant is susceptible to scratching. Looks cool, but is a real fingerprint magnet, after a short time you have the feeling, half the neighborhood had the device in hand. So always have the cleaning cloth ready ;-) Waterproof Case Apple advertises the iPhone 7 with IP67 certification, so it's dustproof and waterproof for 30 minutes to a depth of one meter. So much for the theory. In practice, the iPhone 7 survive a lot, as various Youtube videos show, even a dip in the hot coffee. I just kept it under the tap, and there was no damage. But I do not want to dive with it, but can only make calls in the rain, without fear that the phone will break. Screen The screen measures 4.7 inches, which I consider a very pleasant size. Unfortunately, my hands have not grown as fast as the smartphone industry plans, so I can handle large smartphones beyond the 5.5-inch size with only two hands. The iPhone 7, a one-hand operation is just so possible. The colors and contrasts are very good, if you look from the side of the screen, there are no significant color distortions. From the much brighter display that Apple advertises, I have noticed little - but I turn the screen brightness anyway only in the blazing sunlight to maximum.KameraNun the most important: the camera. The 12-megapixel snap-on now also has an optical image stabilizer, which was reserved in the past two years, only the Plus models. Video footage in the movement are not as blurred as the 6s, in photos, the effect is not so recognizable in my opinion. During the day, the pictures were also good in the previous year, here there are only improvements in detail - such as finer color differences (the camera can record an extended color space to DCI-P3). You can see the differences in low light conditions, such as at night or in dark clubs. The f / 1.8 aperture of the iPhone 7 lets out more light than the 6s (f / 2.2). Unfortunately, the dual camera with which you can optically zoom is only available in the Plus model. The new quadruplet flash feels a bit further, but does no miracles. Whether the pictures are better than the Galaxy S7, is a matter of taste - the S7 makes sharper, bangier recordings, the iPhone 7 seems a little more restrained. Overall, the camera is superior to that of the 6s but in every way. The selfie camera now has 7 instead of 5 megapixels, pictures are a bit sharper. Missing headphone jack Yes, the headphone jack is missing. The package comes with a pair of Lightning headphones and a Lightning-to-jack adapter. According to technical measurements, the sound is somewhat impaired, I could not hear much difference with my headphones - sounded the same as before. That may be different with really expensive premium devices. Best in case of doubt before in the shop or a friend with iPhone 7 probesteen.I have been using bluetooth headphones anyway for some time. Who connects the iPhone with the jack adapter to the car radio, must remember that he can not charge the device at the same time. The new HomebuttonThe Home button, which exists since the first iPhone, is no longer a real button, but was replaced by a touch surface , A vibration motor inside simulates a click. This feels strange at first, but you get used to it quickly. Quite as "" real "" as the Macbook but it does not feel, perhaps because the trackpad is larger there. In general, I like the new "Taptic Engine" that provides vibration - turning the alarm on, for example, makes you feel like you're spinning on a real, mechanical device. Big disadvantage: The Home button can not be pressed with gloves, as the fingerprint scanner will not respond. Sounds banal, but you can unlock the iPhone but not. I imagine that in really cold winter nights annoying. I'm curious, maybe you can fix that via update. StorageBislang had the entry-level 16 gigabytes, now it starts at 32 gigabytes. Since there is no microSD card slot, but you should better grab the 128 gigabyte iPhone (costs 110 euros more). Then you do not have to worry about downloading apps or music on Spotify or snapping lots of photos. The top model has 256 gigabytes, which should only need the least. Battery Apple keeps the battery for two hours longer, I myself felt no real improvement. But that may also depend on the personal usage mix. I regularly use social networks, check e-mails 5-6x a day, read 25 minutes in the morning and evening in the train, get push messages and take some pictures. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are always running. At the end of the day, the smartphone has to be plugged in, more than a day's runtime is not there. Processor Short for computing power: The new A 10 chip is extremely fast, as benchmarks show. In the menu you have nowhere annoying stuttering, but you honestly had the 6s not. Anyone who plays will be able to enjoy more elaborate 3D games in the future, while everyone else will not need the extra computing power. In any case, the processor is state of the art and you're on the safe side for a few years in terms of updates. Stereo Speakers The new stereo speakers are louder and a bit clearer than the mono speaker earlier, but one should not expect miracles. The LG G5, for example, has a more impressive stereo effect. But I prefer to listen to music anyway with the headphones and do not let the whole train listen:) Conclusion If you look once from the new colors, optically not much new is offered. The iPhone 7 is chic, but the wide frame is not quite contemporary. Robust is the smartphone, in the trouser pocket has not bent yet. I liked the better camera and the waterproof case. The new home button is a bit unusual, let's see if more developers will integrate it into their apps (the interface is released). With the battery life one should expect no miracles, the small iPhones must be loaded as usual every night. I certainly will not tell anyone anything new when I say that an iPhone is more expensive than the competition. Comparable Android phones are available for 500-600 Euro, but they do not have an iOS operating system - and for many people it's also about convenience. For my part, I can recommend the iPhone 7. If you already have an iPhone 6 / 6s and you do not want the camera or the waterproof case, you can still wait a year without hesitation.	1
Super Handy, just an iPhone! Everything works fine. Shipping went incredibly fast, it came from Italy and was in less than 2 days.	1
Everything went super. Iphone 7 in original packaging and welded. I had the iPhone 5s before and you can not compare it to this device. The iPhone 7 is extremely fast and makes super nice pictures.	1
Definitely a great thing, does what it promises and is clearly an aid	1
For around 700 € I received an original packed iPhone with all accessories within 3 working days. The enclosed operating instructions and packaging are in Northern / Eastern European language, which however causes no problems with the putting into operation of the mobile phone, since the language for the installation beforehand can be selected. Operation is very familiar and simple, as one knows from Apple. From my side a clear buy recommendation!	1
Goods exactly as described.Nagel new and original packaged, to a like me find unbeatable price at the time.Have found it cheaper anywhere.Fast DeliveryBin very satisfied	1
What can I say, everything works as it should. Super fast, great OS (you have to like that of course - I personally am not that fan of Android) and chic design. The shipping was super fast and easy.	1
The delivery was lightning fast. The price is a lot cheaper than Apple itself. The original iPhone packaged without any quirks, brand new. The operation etc. is as usual with the last iPhone models very easy. Due to the Apple ID and iCloud, the iPhone was ready to go with my data and settings ready and I could use it directly without having to reinstall everything again. Short for: Absolute buy recommendation, price performance is right!	1
Very nice cellphone!	1
HAMMER just am so happy about it as an 11 year old Apple customer>>> I NEVER want to miss it anymore :-)	1
I need to change from Android to iOS. It took a bit of transition (about 1 day), but I've never looked back. I absolutely recommend the iPhone 7.	1
Fast delivery. Goods were original packed and with all accessories. If you already own an iPhone, you do not need to tell anyone who does not have one should quickly get one ...	1
I'm really very satisfied! I bought iphone 7 32 GB silver, works perfect. Unlocked for all operator. (the delivery was real fast)	1
... I found so rather dubious. Especially after reading various negative Rezessionsen.Fand it was strange that one recognizes amazon, the contents of the package directly. Have at the checkout so still the gift option "" Amazon packaging "" selected. With me everything went well. The package came quickly without any quirks with me. It is also an original iPhone 7th most likely always something to the provider. For me it was A-MONTAIN.Bin very pleased with the Apple, and the fact a brand new iPhone 7 over € 150, - to have gotten cheaper.MfG	1
Very good is very nice loads quickly on beautiful camera makes beautiful photos again and again, everyone recommends the phone top	1
If the device arrived I could write something. Pack empty. Already a 7 ... just fine, is just an Apple!	1
I have now obsessed with every iPhone and also made frequent trips to the Android camp. Remarkably, I always landed at Apple. I was not 100% satisfied with every iPhone, I always missed something. Either the photo quality was not great, the operating system was pretty sluggish over time, the screen was too small or the voice quality was not 100% convincing. With this device Apple hit me completely black and (almost) everything right. Here are my personal highlights of the new iPhone 7: The camera has improved Apple: Already at the first photo, I was completely convinced of her. So far, I've always been a bit jealous of the Galaxy Camera, the times are definitely over now. A new image signal processor and a 4x LED flash (True Tone), which according to the manufacturer is 50 percent brighter than the iPhone 6s, improves the camera. It now has: • 12 megapixels • 1.8 aperture • 4K video recording at 30 frames per second • Slow motion video up to 240 frames per second at 720p • Optical image stabilization • Face and body recognition • HDR, continuous shooting, panoramas etc.The selfie HD The camera has an automatic image stabilization and a 7-megapixel sensor. Flash acts as before the smartphone display, but a lot better than the predecessor iPhone 6 & iPhone 6s. Here, Apple has really done a great job, photos and selfies make me again fun, even in poor picture conditions, the pictures are sensational. That's exactly what I wanted! Stereo speakers for the iPhoneWhen you play games or even watch a YouTube video, you can now fully enjoy its costs. From the lower speakers and the outer ear, there is now a nice stereo sound that I do not want to miss anymore. Now music or listening to an audio book is twice as much fun. According to Apple, it is twice as strong as its predecessor and I can only agree. The jack plug has disappeared, does not really bother me. I've been using Bluetooth headphones for a while, or listen to loudspeakers as I said. The iPhone 7 is (finally!) Waterproof after IP67. Something that is delayed by the iPhone gets splash and dust protection.I've been wishing for some time, finally, one is on the safe side. For underwater shots, the protection is not enough, rainy phone calls or a trip to the beach is nothing in the way. The battery life up to 2 hours longer than the iPhone 6s: I hated the iPhone 6s, the battery life was just under all cannon. This update was badly needed. Finally, I can get by with my battery until late in the evening. It now has: • up to 14 hours of talk time with 3G • up to 14 hours of internet use over Wi-Fi • up to 13 hours of video playback.New Taptic engine Home Button: The home button is no longer a mechanical button, but only sensor surfaces, from The Taptic engine is now given a haptic feedback that gives the user the feeling of actually having something depressed. The habituation goes straight into the flesh, it seems somehow more modern and works perfectly. The Taptic Engine gives the user but also in other areas feedback: if you pull down about the message center from the top of the screen, the home button vibrates as soon as the window below "" hits "". Just like the alarm clock: he rings and shakes the alarm. These are playful little things, but exactly this love of detail I like at Apple. Pro great camera with good image quality in low light Waterproof case High speed thanks to Apple A10 Fusion processor with 4 cores Stereo speakers new Force Touch Homebutton beautiful 25% brighter display good battery RuntimeContra- no fast charging mode- no cell phone induction charging- no memory extension►►► ►► CONCLUSION: I love it! I am really happy that I have bought it myself. Brighter display, a great workmanship, extremely fast performance and durable battery compared to my iPhone 6s. My personal highlights are the two cameras and the stereo speakers. Everything I got from my iPhone 6s as extras have been desired, was realized.In terms of performance, Apple has the iPhone 7 once again put on a dashing. The new A10 Fusion processor has four cores: 2 cores are used for demanding applications such as 3D games, the other two are battery saver and Unfortunately there is no fast-charging function and Qi on board, which will definitely be saved for the Iphone 8. I regret the update of my Iphone 6s and can definitely recommend the Iphone 7.	1
I read the recessions on the iPhone 7 with surprise. Why? To penalize a product with only a "*" star because Apple is on it, or you are just a Samsung fan, or think the iPhone is too expensive, and ... .. has nothing, but also nothing to do with the functionality or reliability of the product and falsified only knowingly the assessment of the relevant criteria. Why do people slice only such a "Dünnsch ...." in a so for us buyers so useful product medium? When I make a selection I would like to be told technical and other helpful experiences but not if someone the Appel brand hate because Apple pays no taxes in Germany ... .. I have the request to all who take the time to write a recession to remain factual and for "us" who want to decide yet, useful hints down write.	1
The iPhone 7 screen is better than last year, but compared to the competition is far from the best. In terms of resolution, brightness and contrast, Samsung shows what current display technology can achieve. That the iPhone 7 is better than the previous model , under the metal housing is a powerful processor: The A10 Fusion is to ensure that the smartphone in the pixel hunt on iOS 10 nothing to hang. The processor has 4 cores, with 2 of them according to Apple with a fifth of the energy. The two high-performance cores run only under demanding tasks under full steam. The iPhone 7 is thanks to A10 processor according to Apple 40 percent faster than iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.	1
High-quality mobile phone Surround speaker Waterproof Matt Black Very good software New Touch ID Button Very fast Bluetooth connection with the W1 chip in the new headphones (Airports, BeatsX)	1
After almost two years with the iPhone 6, I made the switch to the iPhone 7 on the key date. An overview can be found here in my video. Of course, this can not show all aspects without becoming long. In addition to this, so here are some sentences here: For someone who like me has omitted the 6s Force Touch, so the pressure-sensitive display, and such a home button is a new experience. But for me in any case a good one. In iOS 10, the sensitivity for the Home Button as well as for the display in 3 levels, so that after a short settling time and the difference between tap and hold - for umlauts - and press works. I had some problems with that for the first few hours. The device itself is no different than the iPhone 6. It's 10 grams heavier, but that does not really matter. The display is better and you can read it well in bright sunlight. The speaker has also gotten better and can quack a bit louder. The lack of the jack plug is one thing I have accepted. Apple has always been a company that has cut off old braids and the old analog jack plug belongs m.M.n. also to. And where is the problem? There are plenty of alternatives and headphones with Lightning port for mobile use. The supplied adapter is not a nice solution, because it looks a bit too filigree - replacement costs 10 euros at Apple but I would complain about it but a defect within the warranty period in the store - but it works properly, so that old headphones or amplifiers continue to be used can. Loading and listening is currently not possible. But Belkin has announced a solution and an (expensive) adapter.The aftermarket will certainly soon offer cheaper alternatives. So just leave the church in the village. The included EarPods with Lightning connection work well and the sound is fine, the left is not good for me and I'm always worried, the things are falling out of my ears, so I'm now Lightning InEars of a third party manufacturer ordered. Largest invisible innovation, which I have not mentioned in the video: the iPhone is dust and water protected to IP67 (I = dust class 6, P = water class 7). It may so fall into the water for up to 30 minutes at a maximum of 1m depth without it breaks it. However, this is not part of the guarantee and a wet device must not be charged, it must first be allowed to dry. But that should already say the common sense;) The protruding camera was not quite my thing with the iPhone 6, the even larger and still a little further out standing camera of the iPhone 7 are no exception. And although I was concerned about scratching the glass on iPhone 6 - and even more about iPhone 7 - that did not happen. However, I am also very careful with my things, so whether that is universal I can not say. A protection would help anyway and this is the only real downside of the iPhone. But compensates the camera with good photos on the level of a good compact camera with a fixed focal length of 28mm KB equivalence and 4k video. All in all, I find my upgrade from the iPhone 6 with 128 GB to the iPhone 7 with 128 GB and I'm up the small software bug in iOS 10, which can empty the battery empty, satisfied. But this bug will be fixed quickly, thanks to Apple's good update policy. Everything else works as expected or better. Quality and impression are correct and I am pleased about (m) a new device. The old man has reliably done 2 years of service with me and was therefore absolutely worth his money. It will certainly satisfy the next owner. For my part I recommend every iPhone 6 owner to upgrade to the 7. It is worth from my point of view due to display, speakers, battery power, camera / video and the very fast operation.	1
Top device! Super fast and very high quality feel! The price hurts something, but would buy the device again and again! Runs error-free without crashes! Since only Lightning also much dustproof!	1
Hello, in advance I apologize for my spelling. Who wants a short conclusion should rather read the last section below. To me and the choice of this smartphone: I am zz. 20 years old and have already quite a LOT of mobile phones durch.Ich grew up in my childhood without a telephone or other Schnick Schnack. I had only one Gameboy. My first phone I got in the 7th grade (a LG KP500) which was a touch phone. After some time I got my second mobile phone a samsung galaxy (with some longer number) my very first "" smartphone "" admitted I did not use all these "" crass "" features of a smartphone. I only needed it to write with friends on WhatsApp or Facebook and Telln with Muddi. Also this phone broke sometime, because I had to buy my own smartphone. This was not possible without a side job ... so now a wanted (newspaper distribution) and money saved. Back then I bought a Kazam (a cheap China brand) I was just not willing to pay 100 Euro for a cell phone. However, this phone was broken. After several years and teachers phones from samsung Sony and co. I thought to buy an iPhone, these were so popular and gehyped .. now with the beginning of my apprenticeship, I bought my first hand on financing, no problem had been counted 200 € and twice a year then a rate of 35 €. Good deal I thought to me ... but even this Telefong broke after a year. (I was more excited about Apple than any of the other phones I've had.Because it was not plastic special alu, was not unnecessarily huge and the operating system was mega easy to understand). One year later (last year) Kahm then samsung Galaxy s7 out .. it was praised so much that I decided to one Contract with mobilcom debitel to take with just this phone. Absolute wrong decision. I do not want to say that the phone is bad, but it was much harder to get along with this phone than with an iPhone .. just because it has too many features I do not need. It was down to me after 3 weeks and was broken in spite of bulletproof glass and cell phone case ... I had ne insurance but from suitable laziness I have not given it. Logically, it broke more and more and now after a year I faxed it thick. I have now bought an iPhone 7 directly from Apple on financing, with 100 € deposit and a half-yearly rate of 80 €. Many think now, what a spast but not just not. I have now brought the s7 for repair and then sell it for 350 ¬ of which I pay the iPhone 7 with. Why the iPhone 7 and not wait for a new one? Why an iPhone generally? Is it worth it for me to use an iPhone? Well I'm not waiting for the new iPhone for the reason that it probably will be priceless anyway because there is an anniversary coming up. I just think that the operating system IOS is easy to understand and clear. It offers certain advantages over android, for example that more people are hacked using android because it is simply more represented. If you are crazy about games you have the advantage that most of the known games come first for iOS than for android. Personally, I find it extremely noble that the Apple for its iPhone on aluminum as a frame, etc, it just feels PORN **. Apple stands for premium (others may see it differently, but I do not) Some argue about the technical data of the different phones, personally I do not care about whether a mobile app opens at the speed of light or not, it is important to me It is worthwhile to buy an iPhone 7 only if you have not had a newer iPhone for some time or if you tell yourself you want the latest from the new one to have it in the Compared to the iPhone 6s not much changed, the button is now a touch sensor instead of a real button, there is no aux more, instead stereo speakers (the aux is missing is absolutely not bad as I think). The iPhone 7 lasts for about 45 minutes in the water and the iPhone 6s never 5 minutes. If you want to have the technical data in mind, however, should ask a professional or read the Internet smart. My personal conclusion is: it's worth it, it's fun and offers exactly what you imagine. Thank you for your attention	1
I have it for about 3 months now and there is nothing to moan about. I am fully satisfied. Interesting are the extreme negative ratings (1 star). For some, I can understand the reason, if e.g. an empty box arrives. But that has nothing to do with the device itself. Here are some again the iPhone z.b. as "" scrap "" designate and one senses when reading the despicable and obviously pathological attitude to Apple and their products. Unfortunately, I can not understand something like that. It is only a product! Actually it should be so that one can write here only a product recession if this product also here. bought through Amazon. So now every stupid Apple haters "puke" here "and write things of what he actually has no idea. That should reconsider Amazon!	1
Have now for about half a year, my IPhone. First the color is beautiful and the workmanship is perfect. You could set it up very quickly and use it completely after just one day. My cell phone has fallen loose 10 times (no bulletproof glass) and it has not broken. Whether on tiles, wood, grass, carpet or stone, it has not broken. Overall, it's the best product I've ever ordered on Amazon.	1
Apple stop. Fast, sure, great cam. Liquid system. Great display. Again and again ... Logical that the battery only one day, right? Nen Porsche also needs 15 liters per 100km and no one complains or how! And why do some people rate the price here? A Porsche also costs 70,000 euros, and? Say something. Quality costs nunmal. Sure, I can also drive a VW, you also come from A to B. All Apple products are great, but also expensive. It's so. And you get good money for a used one. Where does one have that? And why fingers away, as in the last review. Nonsense something. The product should be evaluated, not the delivery. Complaint and good.	1
The iPhone 7 is for me the best device from Apple. Waterproof and fast in class. The display convinces and even 3D Touch has become more useful with this series. Touch ID has become incredibly fast, very rarely that it does not work. Workmanship is great and nothing else to complain about, the matte black is timeless and noble. No comparison to the diamond black which is already scratched after a few hours. We had Samsung and HTC here in the house and not only tried once, it's just nothing to Apple ran. It's easy to argue that Samsung and the others are in league with Apple, so I do not think so. My S3 always liked to go out and sometimes I did not notice that for hours, my wife's S3 had this "" Sudden Death "", the S3 mini of our kids regularly had a flat battery, a friend's kid has an S5 for Christmas Mini received, went on and off several times a day. I did not even have such a nonsense with Apple. In the whole family or circle of friends not even some people are aware of the fact that you can not work so "" freely "" with the iPhone. What should I fumble on a mobile phone or tinker s.System? The time you can better invest in other things than any program to be able to write where you have any effect on the mobile. Anyway, Apple can see everyone as he wants, I think Apple is great and the device does what it should, reliable and like a clockwork. And if something should be then it's just in the next Apple and Apple helps where they can. I really have no idea why so many people complain to Apple. My opinion here should not be anything against Samsung or HTC, we have just made our experiences, it should be an opinion for Apple. Samsung builds beautiful devices and many are satisfied, HTC too. We have made our experiences and just do not trust the two manufacturers anymore.	1
Mobile has arrived today and as always, I'm super satisfied with Apple! No comparison to the Samsung Note 3 that I had before. The Samsung was much slower and stopped constantly or shut down applications due to system errors. I'm glad to have an Iphone again have, because in Apple products you can always trust.	1
The device is my second iPhone and does what it should! Runs great and feels great. Even the battery is great for an iPhone! One is informed before buying and therefore I do not understand the bad reviews here; people seem to be weird (buy an iPhone 7 even though it does not have the features they want: "" I want a 4 inch phone, man, why is the iPhone 7 so big "" ... "" they're getting bigger; hä? Apple since the iPhone 6 not ..). I find IOS better than these gushed androit systems, even if the back and forth copy and move files is cumbersome. Interestingly, all Android phones after 2 years look like junk and creak and knit. My last iPhone is now over four years old and the current operating system is still running well and the phone looks great. My Android friends need new devices every two years, I all 4! In the end, the Android / Apple dispute is not worth it. Then every van driver could argue with a sports car or SUV. Some still buy optics, some just for specifications and others for apps ... I've never been disappointed with iPhones / iPads. From the iMac / MacBookPro already; So I'm not an apple freak but the iPhone is alright :)	1
It's great, the camera and the home button have changed a bit! I love it ... It's even a bit bent!	1
My rating refers to the smartphone as such. Revolution and expectations have nothing to do with fitness as well as valuation. I kept coming back to Apple. Intuitive operation, software optimally tuned to hardware, reliability and security (statements from a lawyer, as many Android phones are cracked, at least more than Apple), absolute harmony between products also from Apple.Android, Windows has always disappointed me. Especially music or photo apps, there are always several apps for one. How so? No idea. Now the iPhone 7.Matt Black looks classy and different. Finally, the jack is gone, too old, has had its day. Wireless is the future. Had the 6S before. The battery now lasts 2 hours longer, charging too long. The camera has gotten better, looks mature. Splashing water and protected from stub. Nothing new compared to the competition, but super. Negative I notice that in iOS 10 the music app is totally bad. I liked better before. Straight operation like eg. Favorite title or random mode, I have not found today. Telephoning and communication with car, headphones and other devices easily and reliably. Operation is absolutely great. Touch ID is getting better integrated with the apps, and Force Touch is becoming more and more simplistic. For me, there are 4.99 stars. The deduction is for the music app in IOS 10, but think that will be solved soon or someone can tell me how the above works;)	1
I have used the S4, S5 and also S6 edge from Samsung in recent years. Although I also use an iPad, I could never imagine getting an iPhone. With the devices from Samsung, the S4 and S5, I was very satisfied. Then the S6 came out and for me it was clear that the edge version will be my new device. Said and done. Now after 6 months of conclusion I am extremely disappointed with the S6 edge. I do not want to fix that on Samsung or the S6 edge as a whole. I want to relate it to the one device I had. Overheated device, system errors, extremely long repair times, etc. have now drawn the last nerve. So I am the dealer of my confidence in search of a smartphone. Here the S6, the S7 or even the iPhone was touted. Since I had not had good experiences with the S6 I reached for really long superior to the iPhone. Now a few days after the purchase, I have to honestly say that iPhone is really a big step ahead of the congruence.	1
I am very satisfied with the phone and therefore give 5 star design: Externally, the iPhone 7 resembles the iPhone 6S. Only the across the smartphone back-crossing antenna strips and the seated at the top of the headphone jack of the previous model are missing the new model to keep it water and Staubducht.The key arrangement is unchanged.Hardware: The make of the GPU of the Apple A10 know we do not yet - maybe it is an improved version PowerVR GT7600, which belongs to the Apple A9. The graphics performance of the iPhone 7 should be 50 percent higher than that of the A9. In addition, an M10 called motion processor for monitoring the sensors is part of the chipset, which has been extended to 2 GB in the iPhone 7 in the iPhone 7 Plus are the A10 SoC3 GB RAM to the side. If you liked this post, please flag it with useful or read my other reviews :)	1
Very cool mobile phone, which has been optimized at every turn. Really great is the CPU, here is a real board expected. Insanity, eye-catching, especially battery life and Force Touch Home Button. Both nice optimizations, as well as the very well-optimized finally available in stereo speakers. All in all, it is like the Porsche 911er: Discreetly evolved, for me great companion. Performance, usability speak for themselves.	1
Hello wanted to ask if on the I Phone 7, 32 gb rose gold, a guarantee is on it? 1 year or 2 years or no ,,, ??? thanks, lg	1
It is running confidently. The device is one of the fastest devices I've ever had, before that I had a Samsung s6 edge and this only caused me problems. Of course, the rounded edges are nice to look at but also something so useless I have not had in a long time. Let alone the plastification of the pictures they seem very unnatural and funny. To the GB RAM I can only say that Apple perfectly adapted its phone to its software compared to the s6 edge, although this 4 gb but 2.5 are constantly in use so that the device has very little power. The iPhone 7 combines these things perfectly together and brings out what to get out is contrary to power hardware phones like Samsung Sony etc. The screen is very good in my opinion. And the fact that the 3.5 mm jack has disappeared bothers me, of course, this causes more wear and tear because of the on and unplug, but be honest who of you buys such a luxury mobile and has no 10 insurance for it? So I do not see any problem in that to be honest. By and large it is the best mobile phone currently on the market.	1
I am very satisfied with the device after one week of use. The performance of various things is not to compare with my previous Galaxy S7. The screen is also much better in comparison. I do not like the unnatural colors of the Galaxy S7 at all. But probably in the eye of the beholder	1
Unbeatable price, fast and easy delivery, what else could you ask for? The iPhone works great, I'm glad that I ordered this way!	1
I have the Iphone 7 now 3 days and can only recommend it. However, not much has changed compared to the 6s, so switching is not really worthwhile.Iphone just got the edge for me - great cloud still the best for me - I just like Design - New Homebutton for me a blessing camera just great - Programs Numbers eg a hammer to working audio with Apple Music a dream	1
Have the new iPhone since yesterday and I'm totally thrilled super workmanship great Design.Zur previous reviews. You're right who will not be able to afford an iPhone and complains about it!	1
My friends got this and it really differs from 6sSome functions are really niceI am going to purchase it...	1
So far, you could trust a new iPhone release. Since iPhone7 this is different. The iPhone7 differs in design and innovations little if any from the iPhone6, on the contrary, it is thicker and heavier. The changes are not tangible for a standard user, who eg. Topfotos wants anyway has a SLR camera, etc. The new iPhone7 is now waterproof, great, I'm probably going to go diving with it, I need it. For this reason, the speaker connection is missing now. Ie. while listening to music lug around another moronic cable. And that in the future I am switching to these stupid air pods is excluded. Shall I stick the Sh .. in the ears while jogging? I already regret that I switched to the iPhone7. And the besch ... Home button is a horror. The whole phone vibrates like a surprise egg. iPhone7 never again, sorry Apple, maybe next time again. And then only after extensive testing of the new release.	1
I love it but can not afford it very compatible better than samsung i love it so i should be able to puke	1
Had several such devices and have now purchased this for a friend who is very excited. It is, as with other APPLE devices as well as a sophisticated fine technology, which unfortunately has its price. However, considering that the system will be updated accordingly and the associated technical standard of this phone, then it is clear again that here a premium device does its job. Even if it is not the newest technology, these functions and the speed of the device are certainly enough for the normal user. If you are looking for a device that is not really outdated and at the same time meets the technical standards, then this is probably the place to be.	1
I have decided for a long time now for the iPhone 7 and me against the iPhone X.My reasons why I keep the iPhone 7 and have returned the iPhone X are the following: Better brighter color rich display without yellowing. This actually bothered me the most on the iPhone X. As soon as you tilted the screen a bit, the display color went from bluish to yellowish. And yes Truetone was disabled! At this price I could not make friends with this highly acclaimed Super Amoled. It annoys immensely that this yellow shimmer is always visible. The iPhone 7 has a fantastic camera, a super battery, lies well in the hand, looks chic and is first-class processed. The speed and features of this Samrtphone at this price are unbeatable. I am very satisfied and can recommend this IPhone unrestricted further. The iPhone was originally welded and new! Sale and shipping by Amazon.	1
This is my third iphone now and I'm not going to get Android anymore. It's just a nice design, a super picture resolution and a very high-quality mobile phone, which suffers very little loss of value. So it can, even if you buy a new yet sold at a fair price and pleased by its longevity and other users . Only the price is a shortcoming for me at Apple. But you can not change that.	1
I bought the 32gb Iphone 7 for my mother. On 12.05. ordered and on Tuesday the 14.05 it was already there. For the time being I had some jitters that it might not be an original Apple Iphone yet unpacked to look and it was a NAIL NEW WASHED AND ORIGINAL PACKED IPHONE 7 inside. Thanks to the serial number, it was also possible to see in Google whether this is an original Iphone! The price was great and we are still satisfied today! Battery performance is great, enough memory, you can only say that it is worth it! Of course you can also make a mistake	1
I was skeptical. But wrongly! I ordered 2 phones. One looked like brand new and one was a mini-scratch (a normal use track) to see. Functionally, not to distinguish from a new one. Really worthwhile for this price !!	1
Speedy delivery of a used iPhone 7 with new housing and display as described by the provider. The battery is in an age-appropriate, good condition, so far everything works without mistakes or quirks. I am very satisfied, the price-performance ratio is very good. I can fully recommend FS-Trading.	1
Delivered on time, device works perfectly, only the case has more damage to the paint. However, the charger was missing.	1
A new original Apple product. You do not need to say anything about it. Exactly what is expected. Simply great!	1
Loved it, it’s been two years now. Loved using apple.	1
The phone leaves nothing to be desired.	1
Everything was excellent even if no accessories were ...	1
Top Handy - what more can you say	1
The iPhone 7 was delivered very quickly. Processing top and it all works fine.	1
The phone arrived in its original box. Condition: New !!!	1
A Mountain bester barn	1
Bought as a Xmas present for my daughter - she has been happy with it so far. No complaints!	1
Ordered via Amazon at "A-Montain": Shipping via Prime very good. Item was still original welded, all top.Ledlich the "leaflets" were in Portuguese but who reads the schon.iPhone 7 is in itself, as expected, a very good smartphone.	1
Already had the iPhone 4, 5 and SE as a business phone and I'm always very satisfied. The hardware has always kept much longer than my previous phones. Well, the software does not pack the iOS updates at some point, so that you need a new one after 3-4 years ;-). I know the iPhone 7 from some colleagues and acquaintances and always thought it was very chic because it was so flat. So I've got it private now. Although I was afraid that for my relatively small hands the decisive milimeters would be too wide, so that I can not hold and type in one hand anymore, but it works :-) The functions have been familiar to me and the tips App gets to know new ones too. The camera is awesome! Something stupid is that the charging cable and the headphones must be plugged into the same socket. Charge at the same time and make calls via headphones is therefore not with the included equipment. All in all, I'm really happy with the part :-)	1
I am very satisfied with the supplied iPhone as well as the supplier. I've been thinking for a long time about buying the 7 Series for the iPhone 5 or waiting for the current version. I was mainly interested in the 128 GB of memory available in this device. Here I had the 5er capacity problems. Of course that's a nice thing. About the remaining super features of the iPhone, there is little to report because everyone who once had such a device no other desires. The dealer is recommended because even on questions and requests promptly reacted. I also have no better offer than found here. I would have also given 6 points here. Anytime gladly again.	1
The delivery was faster than announced and I am very satisfied with the iPhone. So far, I had the iPhone 4s, where the battery has made flabby. I will definitely buy here again!	1
Apple typical, usual quality-super workmanship-great optics-class software, runs despite worse key data better than anything that Samsung and co throw on the market-I'm pleasantly surprised by the new Homebutton-come from the SE and was a bit skeptical because of the size, but if you do not have the smallest Patschepfötchen go the 4.7 inches fully fine! -super price (€ 579 - MSRP € 629) -packaging is on (believe) Russian, so probably intended for the Eastern European area, you realize but only on the back of the packaging (device from TBE International)	1
Fast delivery, orginal newly packaged device and at such a good price. I am very satisfied and have nothing to complain about.	1
iPhone 7 for the top price, including VAT and invoice (even if you have to wait a few days for this). It is not about equipment for the German-speaking market, but who can save the German manual, which otherwise has no differences ,	1
Very nice cell phone with many features. Fast computing. Super camera makes the great pictures. The color looks great too. All in all I am very satisfied.	1
I already had a 5-series iPhone before, I am very excited about this new one and not disappointed in any way. I deliberately waited with the review to gain enough experience. I would buy this 7-er again and again	1
5 Sterne.Das iPhone is Simlockfrei and corresponds exactly to the device information, with which Apple describes the device. Therefore, I can not understand some buyers who complain that the AUX connection is no longer exists. The device I have now 2 months in use and works perfectly.	1
I switched from an iPhone 4 to the 7 Series. The device runs fluently and looks very good. 100% recommendation (the price is of course steep).	1
The new Iphone 7 was again a class device which Apple has developed. Today in 2018, it is still running flawlessly and the battery still holds as on the first day. Only the lack of AUX connection is a pity. But well, times are changing.	1
The device is working properly. All mentioned utensils were included. It always pays to always buy Apple products. The memory of 32 MB is fully sufficient for me.	1
As an Iphonefan, I now have my third device, starting with Iphone 3, then 5s, and now the iPhone 7, so far I am very satisfied and did not go along with every increase, which in my opinion is quite sufficient.	1
Super cell phone in the usual Apple quality. Good workmanship and the absence of the jack connection is no problem. If required, the enclosed adapter can also be used.	1
very good and cheaper than others. I really like that. Apple Iphone 7 is very nice a cell phone for me.	1
I was skeptical at first because the price was so cheap, but it was all right. Delivery was with UPS and the cell phone arrived undamaged. I had only Android phones before and was just curious. It was worth it and I'm probably one of the few that likes both Apple and Android. Very easy to use, the camera is great and it is waterproof. I would not try taking underwater shots now. The sound quality is first class and otherwise the quality is good. And thanks to the silicone shell and bulletproof glass foil which I bought extra, it has already survived several crashes unscathed.	1
I do not need to say much about the iPhone 7 ... just great! Nevertheless, I had to return the phone because the version I ordered in Austria did not work. Nothing was mentioned by the provider, especially since the shipping to Austria was also offered. After unpacking the mobile phone, I had the first (negative) Aha moment. There was no EU plug, but the power plug for the US ..... this was not the main problem. IPhone 7 charged (of course, with a "" normal "" plug for Austria), Austrian SIM card inserted, go through the first part of the registration on the iPhone, Game over! SIM card is not recognized. Then tried several Austrian SIM cards, unfortunately no success. Because of this, I had to understand slowly now that this sold and offered version of the iPhone 7 does not work for EUROPE. The Amazon support contacted, problem described, order no. communicated, and recognized the local hotline lady also immediately that the offered version passed on any information to the customers that it is a pure US iPhone 7. Returns are accepted immediately, and credit is made. Have a European version - and all Tip Top! Thank you Amazon for this great transaction within 4 days.	1
I bought the iPhone 7 with 128 GB purchased as a retreaded product. It looks like new! To the iPhone itself, everything has already been said, I try to supplement: since I once again skipped a few models (previously had the 5S) I had to get used to something in terms of operation. The now-side lock button causes the phone, I always accidentally turn off, although I only want to carry it through the area. But only as a small anecdote. Can you get used to it? Touch ID is much better than the 5S. However, you have to be careful that you do not unintentionally unlock the phone in your pocket. Luxury problem. The phone is very fast, so far there has been no dropouts and it is running very stable overall. It is great in the hand, where I recommend a sheath to people with smaller hands, otherwise it can slip out of the hand due to the smooth surface sometimes times. Top product!	1
Proven Apple quality, no negative surprises. Acquisition of the data from the old iPhone 6 also worked very well. The only drawback was a Hermesbote, pretending not to find our address, which delayed the delivery by one day. That would not have happened with Navi.	1
I bought the 32GB iPhone 7 in matte black from Planet-Online2015, which was described as new and ovp. The description was 100%: The iPhone was unopened, the packaging contents completely. Having already read horror reviews about other sellers, I would like to make a very clear recommendation for the dealer! Before the final payment, I was also advised that the invoice is shown after differential taxation without VAT - who should have something against it, so can still withdraw before completing the order process of it. To the iPhone itself has already been said a lot, I can only to add my personal experience: After I skipped some iOS versions - my last iPhone was the 3GS with iOS 6, which has accompanied me for four years - I found myself in iOS 11 very quickly and I am after longer trips to BlackBerry and Samsung, which also have their advantages, but also clear disadvantages / bugs, (again) really excited: The phone is very fast, there was no dropouts and it is running very stable overall. For me, the purchase was definitely worth it! Although the price is not a cardboard handle, but I'm sure to have a phone for it, of which I will have something for the next few years, instead of having to buy another after just 2 years already another.	1
Certainly the best iPhone ever. Definitely the fastest. It's just fun on the internet, taking photos, editing e-mails etc. The new Home Button works wonderfully and recognizes fingerprints very reliably and fast. Definitely better than the 6s and, above all, much faster. For me, the most natural color reproduction of all smart phones in terms of display and photography. I am very pleased.	1
I ordered the iPhone 7 with 32 GB on Amazon at this provider, because he was one of the cheapest. The iPhone arrived within 3 days and works as expected by Apple. TOPVerseller TOPPreis TOPProdukt TOP	1
It's exactly what you expect. Top product, top service from the shipper. Highly recommended, item and sender Top Genial	1
The iPhone 7 is in itself a good mobile phone. 1 star deduction because it bothers me, that z. B. can not separately set the alarm clock to quiet. The volume can only be adjusted to the complete mobile phone. Sometimes you want to hear the message tones quietly but the ringtone loudly. This is not possible. For WhatsApp there are only 1 standard ringtone, no selection as in Android. It is already a change from Android to iPhone. I do not know yet if I would order it again. What's great is the crisp picture. I use the iPhone for about 1 year.	1
I had until now always Iphones and since I was satisfied with everyone to date, I now bought the 7 Series with 128Gb. Again, I can only say, top quality!	1
It was a gift to my friend. And he is so excited that he really tells me on every occasion how satisfied he is with his iPhone. I personally prefer the Android. He did, but always complained to me that he wanted to go back to Apple. Well, what the hell. Main thing he is happy. For my part, I stay with Android.	1
The iPhone 7 has a sufficiently large display, so I can read everything without problems and even sometimes without reading glasses. It is super thin and fits well in the hand. The photos are beautiful. The functions are actually the same as the iPhone 5S. I am definitely satisfied.	1
New iPhone at the best price and fastest shipping. The iPhone 7 is m.E. By far the highest quality and most intuitive smartphone on the market, absolute buy recommendation.	1
It fits well in the hand, is not too big and is easy to use like my old iPhone SE	1
So after 6 happy years I switched to iphone 7 with my iphone 4. Sure, I'm first thrilled by the speed of my new phone;) It should be noted that my iphone 4 had no quirks after six years of intensive use, despite several beach holidays and a few falls with shell, it was only mitlerweile really slow. ... I hope this iphone will last for a similar amount of time. I hesitated for a long time, because I find the new design idiom of the iphones unfortunately a little sightless. The 4 and 5 had just more profile .... But good, but the screen is now larger and the photos and videos look gigantic, with the current resolution. Great toy! Only at Siri you can complain about something, you can not even recommend a restaurant for a business lunch, you have to do everything yourself .... is not that bad either;)	1
Actually, there is not much to say about this phone, in the family we now all use an iPhone, from 5 to 7plus, we are convinced of these phones. The software is self-explanatory and largely immune to crashes. Viruses are there as good as no.Kamera and remaining hardware top. Apps must be shared by Apple - so they all work fine, but not for free. I would grab an iPhone again at any time.	1
Have had a Samsung S7 before and the iPhone 7 beats it in my opinion in terms of performance by far. The display may be slightly better / sharper on Samsung, but you will not notice this in use ... is ultimately just a date that is on paper.	1
What do you expect, it's just like the 6s, but there are small differences. The operating system OS is not version 9 but 10, so safer, more modern and the update capability longer. Also because here are still improvements to be developed, who knows what you understand a roadmap operating system. Furthermore, here is a QuadCore installed as a processor, which is also fast and more modern technology. So here are still plenty of reserves available. I can only recommend the iPhone 7.	1
Order was Sunday evening, device was Thursday lunch there with Hermes. If you want to buy cheap, just wait 1-2 days mehr.Verpackung and device were originally packed and welded. The device was quickly set up without problems - we are satisfied.	1
I am completely satisfied. I have a private laptop Mac, so it's compatible with iPhone for me to be compatible. The delivery was also very fast.	1
Have the phone for two weeks now and I'm mega satisfied, the condition was described as good, but I could not find a single flaw. I would order a hand here again at any time	1
I gave it to my wife and she is thrilled. Especially the camera has become much better and you learn to appreciate the larger display after getting used to it.	1
The article arrived quickly and well packed. Writing to the iPhone is actually superfluous. Compared to my old iPhone 4 a quantum leap. Worth the somewhat high cash expenditure.	1
I moved from Nexus 5X. In my opinion build quality and industrial design of iPhone 7 is head above Google Pixel and 2 heads above Galaxy S7.I haven't used all the Android customizations (launchers, widgets, etc.) so this is not a problem for me in IOSI also haven't used headphones with my old phone for ages, so lack of 3.5mm jack is not an issue as well.Pros:* Build quality, materials, design* On average 5 years of IOS updates support versus 2-3 years for Android / Nexus* Haptic engine is awesome* 3D Touch is much more usefull than I initially thought it will be* Love Live Photos* Battery life way better	1
As an old-established Android fan, I switched to the Iphone 7 and just completely satisfied with it. It is very fast and does what soll.Absolute buy recommendation!	1
It was a Anniversary gift to me from my Wife. I was really excited whole day till I get my Anniversary gift.As we expected it to come, the item is delivered in time. I am really satisfied with iPhone 7 (4.7 inch). It's my first Apple Smartphone after I switched from Samsung Galaxy S3.Best features of iPhone 7 which I discovered till now ( though there are many more):- Awesome battery life. I charge after 2 days- Front & Rear Cameras with image stabilization- Waterproof- 3D Touch- Finger Print scanner allowed many Apple Apps to use fingerprint for secured access- Lightweight & thin	1
Apple iPhone 7 32GBBy now everything is great! Have the phone for a week and am very satisfied. Cell phone arrived in the specified time.	1
I changed from the iPhone 5S to the 7, because I had problems with the home button on other devices. The advantage of the 7ers is that there is no physical home button anymore. A (relatively) strong vibration feedback simulates but a keystroke, which actually works well. For me, the feedback could be even more intense (in the settings you can choose between 3 levels).	1
I bought the iPhone for my son, it was delivered on time, but since it is only a few days old I can not say anything about functionality	1
Now almost 10 years Android, I had the nose now quite full. The devices are totally littered, updates come only a limited time and a reasonable backup is virtually impossible without root. Last time I had the S7 and was actually satisfied. Now a new one should come. However, there is currently not really an Android device which would have moved me to 100 percent to buy. The coincidence, it was probably so that I was able to acquire very good conditions a 6S used. Initially I wanted to knock the part after setting up only in the bin. However, I read a lot about iOS and also watched a few videos. After 2 weeks I realized that I did not want anything else. So I bought the iPhone 7 with 128gb and the 6S left to my daughter who is absolutely happy now. The reasons why I am new despite the 8 and the 10 have specifically decided for the 7, are the following: - 128gb memory (there are no longer the new) - metal housing (after 2 years Samsung with glass back I was fed up with it too) - a chip that will be in the future long enough Updates can get - the very successful optics update on iOS 11.2 (significant improvement in battery life) - very good camera - cheaper price - water and dust protectedI think I will keep this device now only a few years. Much of Apple just goes better. Once you get used to iOS, you notice the benefits very quickly.	1
The iPhone was original packaging, fast delivery, the iPhone is open for all cards and accepted without problems from my network. Thanks to the company man can only recommend weider	1
The phone is fast, undamaged, original packed and sealed arrived at my home. One can argue about the qualities and characteristics of the iPhone, but they are well known and will not be mentioned again. An original invoice with VAT card was bei.Für the price in any case recommendable;)	1
I switched from the S7 Edge to the iPhone 7. The mobile phones that I had owned from Apple can be counted on one hand (3GS, 4S, 6). Otherwise, Android always remained faithful. As a longtime and extremely satisfied Anrdoid user (there was a little trip to Apple when the iPhone 6 came out) I severed my S7 Edge with a heavy heart to fish in strange waters. To date, I had mostly flagships on which Google's OS lief.The iPhone 7 differs only partially from the iPhone 6 / s in terms of design - but I greet it very much that this time there is a completely black color, without the gray back. The matte black is relatively insensitive to fingerprints and (still) scratchy. By design, I find the iPhone simple but modern. No mega camera collection on the back such as the G5 LG or similar. Devices. I just like it when it's clean and simple - but that's a matter of taste. The fingerprint sensor, which lies under the Froce-Touch homebutton, responds very quickly and accurately. The homebutton actually feels like a real button. I could never imagine that before I had it in my hand. Apart from the design, however, the biggest point of getting used to was the operating system. As an Android user I was used to being able to change EVERYTHING. Alternative Tastauren, Launcher, Themes, Custom Roms, etc. This is unfortunately not so. Apple develops a smartphone with the iPhone, which the user takes as much as possible. There are hardly any possibilities to change even more than the background. But what really stands out positively is that it runs totally smoothly. The A10 Fusion, which is "just" a quad-core (the competition already uses Octacore processors in mid-range smartphones). I have not noticed any hangovers or delays yet. Really, great tuned OS !! (For converters, however, took some getting used to). However, there are some points that I would call "" negative points "". Yes, you read yourself before you buy such a device and yes, you have to compromise, because you can not have everything ... but I think there are some important features, such as. a notification LED, the ability to personalize your device, Quick Charge and Qi Charge. These things can already be found today in the 200 € segment. But yes, as you know it from Apple and anyone who buys such a device, knows that he makes compromises. The camera makes good pictures, as far as I can judge that as a photo layman. Force Touch is a cool gimmick, What I did not know before buying the iPhone. Missing jack does not bother me personally. Despite all that is missing, I am extremely surprised by the iPhone 7. Google apps are easy to install, which worried me a lot. Despite the lack of features, which are in the end only nice-to-have, I give here 5 stars, because I am very satisfied with this device. Yes, the device is expensive, that was never different with Apple and yes, one also pays for the name, but one must not forget that Apple supplies here a 1a device, which drives around in the Top 3 of most Benchmarks.Kaufempfehlung for all, who would like simply simple, simple and simple.No purchase recommendation for all , who attach great importance to individualization and are eager to experiment.	1
iPhone 7 is a good product, glad I bought it. and this transaction was protected by amazon, but worked without any problems.	1
I use my I Phone 7 now for almost 9 months professional, about my impressions and experiences, I would like to briefly report here a little bit. That I Phone smartphones are not particularly reliable should be known, I am in the handling because it is not my phone, but asked by my employer was very careful in dealing. This is not true for all my colleagues, here there were already some display damage. Unlike Samsung phones, in my opinion, the sensitivity is very high. I therefore recommend using the I Phone in conjunction with a protective cover (best Flip Case). Now for the I Phone itself. I am very impressed by the workmanship and the high-quality feel. The phone is built very narrow, yet it fits well in the hand. The battery keeps me just under 4 days. The camera makes super sharp images and the sound through headphones or speakers is outstanding. What I like about I-Phone better than many Android devices is that more apps are available u.a. Sky go. Incidentally, I privately use a Sony Ericsson Xperia Z 1 (I have already rated it here). I am fortunate enough to be able to work with an I Mac and an I Pad in addition to my I Phone. The combination and interaction of the systems is a great way to make things easier, whether it's phoning, exchanging data or simply handling them. UPDATE August 2018I would like to add two more points. I use the I-Phone 7 now for almost 18 months and I'm still super satisfied, the battery in continuous operation (music), although unfortunately a little, but you can load it yes. Recently, the phone fell into the pool (was there about 5 minutes until I noticed it, water depth 1.50 m), while I noticed that it is waterproof;) In addition, I fell from 3 meters from the ladder, directly on the side where I plug in the good piece had, the phone went better than me afterwards. Therefore, the I Phone 7 is absolutely dub suitable! I am happy to answer any questions!	1
Super, great Telefon.warum I have not already gained one before. Super, great. I can only recommend the phone. I changed from Android to IOS.	1
The iPhone 7 I was curious and again, unfortunately, there was not much new ... But some small changes are there like IP67 but why not IP68 as s.Samsung or Sony ?? But I do not want to do it badly, the iPhone has a lot of course good the camera is really first class pictures and videos can really be seen no matter whether the sun is shining or low light the pictures are super. The heavy mirror reflex can now also stay in the closet. For people who often use FaceTime the 7MP front camera is really Well. The new Homebutton here you get used to in seconds, a short firm pressure and you feel a vibration and it gives the feeling that you have a right button. The display is as usual Apple just a good 25% lighter to the old device yes, I can confirm and I think well just when the sun is shining and you can see what the 25% are already worth a lot. The sound finally Apple :) Speakers Stereo at the pages just as a gamer on the iPhone, you often come with your fingers on the speaker and hear nothing more that is now over. Sound is in my opinion even better than the HTCK jack no more so bad it is not the right cable is with it and sometimes can continue to use all the headphones, but the part is already small and I had to search for it after 2 days, and if it has to happen quickly it can happen that you can not find it so always best s.den headphones. New colors I have dull black and am satisfied with the Diamond Black I would be too afraid that it scratched quickly. Memory 32 GB 128 GB 256 GB yes these are already today sizes that you need just when an update comes or the next holiday, therefore, the bigger the better. Price Ok you want an iPhone and it costs clearly, there are other manufacturers, the good part, even better devices and only a fraction cost but if you have an iPhone it is difficult to separate and if you still have a Mac and iPad you should already invest the money. My conclusion: It is an iPhone like any other with a few good news and I think the change from my iPhone 5 to the iPhone 7 was really worth it. I have made a short unboxing video so you can see what's in the box so inside. Thanks for reading.	1
Come from the 5S, which I lost in the US. I then bought the 7 128 Gb, sim free, model A 1660 in Palo Alto. Model A 1660, because it has the faster Qualcomm modem. The device is very very good, the feel excellent, the material impression high quality; it is damn fast, and has a razor sharp and bright display - with the battery I come to 2 days (I'm not a player). The voice quality is i.O. in Internet telephony (eg via FaceTime) anyway brilliant. Also, the reception strength is better than that of my previous 5S. Bluetooth connection to the BMW hands-free is easy. The missing jack slot for the headphones has not bothered me so far, in contrast to the 5S is in my opinion even the sound quality on the new output better. (Tests have probably already confirmed this) quality of the photos absolutely OK; Focusing fast; good results even in the dark (always measured that we photograph here with a phone) Overall, the best iPhone that I ever had (previously 4S, 5S) and together with the Apple silicon case in navy an eye-catcher.IOS crashes so far: 0Habe the phone is now 3 weeks in operation, should soon be new things, I will tell this here.	1
After the iP4, I made short trips to Windows Phone and Samsung Galaxy, now with iOS 10 and iP7 back to Apple. This phone is fantastic, iOS 10 is so well tuned that the operation is easier by dimensions than other systems, in the Compared to the cheap Android updates come quickly and you realize that a company behind it take care of it. The iPhone is really the best phone ever, the lack of KHBuchse was not a second a problem, in the car Bluetooth works perfectly.	1
I do not understand the negative reviews. The iPhone 7 is a lot easier (you can compare) and the home button or the fingerprint scanner works flawlessly and corners more reliable and faster than Samsung Phones.Why I buy the new iPhone when the missing headphone connection bothers me? Is as incomprehensible to me as the fact that he is missing. There is an adapter, so where is the problem? And to all Samsung Lovers: also the next Samsung Galaxy comes without headphone jack. Back to the iPhone: top camera, super fast, no jerks, nice design, great 3D touch and the stereo Speakers also sound a lot better than the 6s. Also, the battery lasts much longer. I regret the purchase by no means, on the contrary. The best smartphone / iPhone I have ever had and 100% recommendation.	1
I buy the new iPhone every two years. I like to think of it as the first thing in the world with the whole world. This year, unfortunately, o2 had so many delivery problems that I had to wait two weeks ... Now I have the iPhone here: Apple iPhone 7 Smartphone (11.9 cm (4.7 inches), 32GB internal memory, iOS 10) matte blackIf I held it in my hands, I was simply thrilled. It touches iPhone typically good. The workmanship is right! Apple like halt ... Packaging and Design: - The box is as always super chic in a white cardboard dress - The matte black looks super chic and the fat fingers can not see immediatelyFor more design impressions just watch the video! Product: Just if you before the Iphone 6 or worse in operation, you immediately notice the speed. Apps run much smoother and get started faster.Highlights: - It's waterproof! No kidding, I tested it too! Just make sure that you do not immediately connect it to a charger, but wait about 30 minutes for the Lightning connection to dry. Then you can load without hesitation.- No real home button more: The new home button makes you feel as if he would give in. but he does not. The lower part of the iPhone vibrates so that it looks like it is giving in. Great! - The camera is great too! A huge difference to the iPhone 6! Definitely try the live photos! Conclusion: I would recommend it unreservedly! Yes, it costs a lot of money, but it's worth it. I sell my old iPhone every two years, because the things are really stable. For questions, just post a comment. I would be very happy if you gave me a "" Yes "" for "" Was this review helpful? "" Leaves!	1
Very stable mobile phone is very goodIn the hand fast access to apps very fast processor, I like the phone very well	1
Preliminary, I have not bought the product on Amazon.de.This is not a review that enumerates all the technical advantages, but my subjective opinion.I previously had only Samsung phones of the Galaxy series (S2, S4, S5, S6 and S7) and bin switched to the iPhone, because I have some Apple products in addition to the iPhone as the Apple TV, Ipod and especially a MacBook Pro. For these products, I've been very pleased with Apple's quality and support. In addition I had many problems with the Samsung mobile phones. 4 of the phones had Qualitative flaws that I could not live with. Therefore, I wanted to try the iphone. It should be said that I have the US version and it came to me Refurbishes. The phone is not an Android phone and I thought that myself the annoying setting for personal settings would be annoying, but I have to say that iphone is like my mac. It does exactly what it should and what I want to do is have it. At least once a week, I run to my friend and tell him what I've found for a new feature. This bothers me the often mentioned not existing back button. Since where you need the function there are back arrows and otherwise I'm faster on the home button anyway. I have synchronized my devices with each other, which was the most important decision criterion for me. Here, Apple can clearly points. Whether it is iMessage or Facetime everything is on both devices and the annoying back and forth copy is verschuwndenMein device was unfortunately already broken when I received it. Unfortunately, the microphone was broken, but Apple has its bomb service, it's almost up to Amazon I think, and I had very quickly now a brand new IPhone.Also the subjective opinion of an Apple disciple may not count for many, but I'm convinced of Apple and how many are: Once Apple, always Apple even if a piece is missing in the apple.	1
I had the iPhone 6s and had sworn that as soon as the whole thing comes out waterproof I will buy the new device. I did that right away. I was able to update without much loss of value because I was able to sell my old device very well. What many have not mentioned yet are the small feedback that the device provides about the Taptic engine in everyday use: for example, when adjusting the times of the alarm clock or pull down the notification bar, etc. This is of course not decisive for the fight, but that's it What I appreciate about Apple: They really try to make you feel like you do not just have a cheap, stupid electronics thing in your hand. It is also a bit lighter, that feels very comfortable. The camera is better, the battery life is a little better. I am very happy with the purchase.	1
What should great say to an iPhone The processing of the iPhone is great and Apple has done this year again right with the iPhone 7 I am more than happy and am glad that I have this sweetheart	1
I have grown from 4S to 7 after 5 years and am very excited. Even in the sea, I have already swum and have made wonderful holiday videos / photos. Only and alone that you can not load and listen to music at the same time I noticed the opener unpleasant. Otherwise thumbs up!	1
pro: - Extremely reliable and stable operating system - super fast and reliable TouchID - despite "" low "" resolution, the display in real life is simply more natural and beautiful to look at than the OLEDs.- awesome homebutton with ingenious Taptic Engine- extremely high quality (as usual ) - great sound for a smartphone- great cameras- waterproof- enough batteryContra: - fake speaker opening to the left of the home button. The asymmetry would not have harmed the design! - Difference to 6S is too low	1
Unfortunately, there are too many jealous people on the market who prefer to use Android phones. But let it be one for years and the market figures say it's a bad product just because you can not or do not want to afford it The phone is as always class-wise, of quality anyway and above all, stable in use. I have iPhones since Generation 4 and have never had a crash. We have in the household exclusively Apple products that work well with each other. There are 3 iPhones, 2 Mackbooks, a Mac Mini, 3 IPdas and an airport. There has never been any problem with any device, just once an application error promptly resolved by friendly service personnel. Also there is certainly how to call into the forest .... All in all, a phone without quirks. We will stay here in the future and can only recommend it.	1
Actually I was happy with the iPhone 6, but the hardware of the S7 edge appealed to me a lot. Great part and certainly also cheap, if you compare it with the iPhone. But the Android system, the iOS just can not keep up with the water. Especially with the iOS10 this is striking. Away with the complexity, the barely existing stability ... to the intuitiuven, stable, high-performance and great OS. To iPhone7 now a few words, because I could hold it in my hands: Yes, the design has hardly changed. Why should it be different? It's ok if it succeeds. Since you can treat yourself to an extra year and come up with a new design. It lies well in the mobile phone, does not have the optical Schnick-Schnack the edge of the S7 edge. This edge is rather annoying than helpful, because again and again apps are started that you do not want to start. Just write comments, if you had the thing in his hand. When it comes to a star ... that's ok, but then honestly and with arguments. :)	1
Very nice and valuable iPhone. As always with Apple (my 3 iPhone) is processed high quality and everything works without problems. All those awarded only one star are poor guys who can afford only a cheap plastic smartphone from the grenade manufacturer Samsung. All Android Smartphone manufacturers have the worst service imaginable. Apple service is top. Had a Samsung S3 before. Was a disaster the phone. Self-ripping displays are not even available at Apple. The Android operating system can not be enough for iOS anyway. Can not understand why some TV manufacturers take such a shitty system as Android even for your TV. Like, for example, the scrap manufacturer Philips. I would always buy an iPhone because it is the best phone.	1
Perfect as always at Apple. Whoever said something else never had it in his hand or thinks too stupid.	1
I love IOS because It's less susceptible to viruses﻿I love IOS because It's less susceptible to viruses﻿I love IOS because It's less susceptible to viruses﻿	1
Had to order it as a replacement phone due to defect of my main mobile phone. Im very happy with it, it all works	1
Everything great! Really, I'm excited. I have taken the iPhone 7 Plus, 32gb in the variant new. I highly recommend it! It came in its original packaging, so tell me, with all the accessories! I'm really excited the phone is absolutely top.	1
I needed a new smartphone because my iPhone can not handle 3 different apps. Actually a pity. I wanted to stay with the iPhone and have taken a bit bigger according to my age. I am very satisfied with the operation and the performance so far. So far, I have refused to be on the road online. I have enough PC at home. Sometimes I call my e-mails on the way too. Necessary or not necessary !!!	1
I bought the product on Sunday evening and it arrived this afternoon in Germany. Very fast delivery, considering that it came from Austria. Very satisfied with Tech Accessory Store. Many Thanks	1
Just a great phone. For older people like me, who already see worse, the big screen is very pleasant. I also have no problems with the size of the device. The Apple typical APP world and all the services I think for years so I'm still excited, but here the ghosts seem to split. :-) Funny when you think of things that just do what they should ;-)	1
A great product, like any of the Apple products. You do not have to say much about it.	1
I chose the 7 Plus because the backside is not made of glass and of course the price was also a reason why I decided for an older model. It is now my fourth IPHONE and I get along so well	1
I bought the phone for my birthday and it arrived 5 days later. Packing had no damage and also the phone was, as expected and expected, as ordered. (New) Would buy it again!	1
Perfect	1
My daughter is thrilled, she has made it from the pockets of money.	1
I think everything fits. The price and the performance of the mobile phone match. However, it took 2mobate on the phone until it arrived. But that is probably due to my location. I would recommend the phone.	1

My son is very excited about the phone. I can not say anything because I'm not using it. I would be too big if I'm honest. But otherwise OK.	1
Mega awesome smartphone. Operating system and hardware are perfectly matched and it just looks great! If you have a certain budget, do a little more for something good !!!	1
Everything's fine. Thank you	1
I switched from a good android phone to the iPhone 7 Plus and I have to say that it is really great I miss nothing and it is super fast the camera is really great. The battery lasts 2 days with me I'm very satisfied .........	1
I ordered the iPhone 7 Plus not via Amazon, but directly from Apple. For the following reasons I have chosen this iPhone. with the large display, I can easily watch videos and photos I use it as an external monitor for my Panasonic GH 5 ... top with a hot shoe adapter and a tripod mount combine the iPhone 7 Plus in normal light conditions as a secondary camera test it self-developed AppsDas iPhone 7 Plus is very stable with the iOS operating system and just runs around! It has not noticeably slowed down and surfing is fun ... it does not constantly pop up an advertisement hoch.Was I like very well synonymous with an existing PC. I can transfer my shot photos to the iMac in a matter of seconds. If this review helped you, please click on "Useful", thank you. :) And if you want to read more reviews from me, so look in my profile.	1
I'm totally satisfied. The phone is just as I imagined. There was even an envelope, which I was very happy about.	1
Very satisfied with the purchase. Handling: Fast and without complications. Mobile in itself: device meets all my requirements. From the iPhone 4S to the 7 Plus - Almost a quantum leap	1
Update 28.08.2017: The device is now sporadically on / off! No service possible! Repair date GRAVIS Braunschweig. Result Device defective. Was within 3 days completely replaced by APPLE. Now everything runs as it should. No star deduction, since it is still a top phone! So far, it was used in the same color, the 6S 64GB.Nun it should be bigger and even better.So 7 Plus 128 GB ordered here and with terrific delivery, as always, received. Currently Comparable! Fast, top design and great camera! Clear Buy recommendation .Apple halt! A greeting to all Android lovers :-)	1
I am very surprised to the positive. One always hears that one should not buy mobile phones in the internet since one is cheated otherwise. My Iphone 7 Plus is brand new and packaged well with me. No scratches or damage. I am very satisfied despite the initial existing worries that it does not matter, etc. Highly recommended "" "" "" thumb high	1
I am thrilled. The battery lasts much longer. The homebutton is awesome. And the camera: A TraumAchja, you can even talk with it :)	1
The iPhone 7plus is as expected a top smartphone, but I have to warn the seller Planet-Online2015. The iPhone had a Swedish Simlock which was concealed. The communication with the seller is terrible. No tangible information, long waiting times, etc. After about 8 days I was finally able to use the device. They did not even apologize.	1
Have the iPhone 7 Plus now for 2 years in use. The quality is really great. The camera is really innovative. I had to change the battery first, but I played a lot with my mobile phone. That was my first iPhone. Before that, I had the Samsung Note 3. I'm staying with iPhone now! I really have nothing to complain about here. The iPhone has never crashed.	1
Really in love! The product hasn't any damage and it's in perfect conditions. The only thing that isn't as with a new Iphone from Apple is that you just get the cable without an adaptor. The rest worked perfectly!	1
What stands out the most, is the ingenious battery life. So I own the iPhone now for some time and the battery sometimes holds despite music, Facebook, Instagram, etc. 10-12 hours	1
I think iphone is the best handymark ever but unfortunately I have none because my mom and grandma think that is too expensive, can someone tell me many benefits to i phones please	1
I am very interested in this device from Apple and I would like to do a review on it I review many devices on youtube but I mostly do live videos and I was hoping maybe I could get a free device to review live this friday	1
especially the camera is lonely top, I mothed my old camera the same. Otherwise, the iPhone is just apple quality	1
Hello, I have owned the iPhone 7plus for a little over 3 months now and I have to say that I am completely convinced! Super fast processor, strong camera, huge battery and a great display. I already owned several Samsung and Apple devices but was not convinced by anybody. The only two criticisms are the super long charging time (which could be limited by a stronger USB adapter but limited) and the poor display surface ratio, which does not prove to be a problem for me by my comparatively large hands. The camera is just breathtaking !!!	1
Bought: iPhone 7 Plus Silver 32GB, overhauled. I'm super happy with the phone. It is like new and in perfect condition. The seller was very nice and helpful.	1
I am very satisfied with the iPhone 7 plus. The delivery was also quick and easy. I had the iPhone 6 plus before and was very satisfied with it.	1
Completely satisfied. Original packed without damage and everything in top order earlier than expected and no problems with the product	1
I have treated myself to the Iphone 7 plus and do not regret it! Reacts fast, makes great photos ... at the beginning I was not so convinced because I had previously samsung s7 but that has reacted to me too fast but the photos had a sharpness ... but after the change to the plus and am with days of play very convinced (the first impression says it counts ... in mobile phones rather not) I'm very satisfied! Supplement: I noticed in nature shots when especially many green shades are here (eg: forest or trees only) because the camera is very overwhelmed ... is that only with me or with you too? as soon as houses or the sky is there, it's actually ... a forest photo is added ... the scenery (last photo) was photographed out of the train ... beautiful	1
Amazon provides great service. I love to purchase anything from amazon's only because it gives you freedom and flexibility.Thank you so muchAmazon.de	1
I think the phone is just great. The phone contains everything a cell phone needs and even more. The phone has a very good camera and a very good lighting conditions on the display. The colors are very clear especially from the photos. The Siri service is excellent and fulfilled everything you could wish for. I can only recommend the phone (headphones are also great)	1
For over 2 months I've been wondering which device is next to choose from, after spending 2 years intensively using the iPhone 6 Plus. The device itself was a very stable and above all powerful smartphone, but you noticed over time that the speed and the reaction to all controls turned out to be much too slow and delayed, so that I no longer enjoy using it. After years of use I had to calculate future plans, which device I will buy next in connection with a contract extension. Here was the following selection between the respective devices: The iPhone 7 Plus The iPhone SE (very famous currently and for the handy use highly recommended ) or the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE. As a Mac user of many years, I naturally had to consider many factors such as compatibility, in the case of a smartphone that is not offered by "Apple". I particularly liked the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE because of the curved display, which has a resolution of 2K and had a nice look and comfort in handling. Operating in combination with Android 6.0 surpassed all my expectations, and I was very enthusiastic about both software and conditionality with one hand, but I knew that using third party software on the Mac would be difficult, for example, updating or transferring data between the Mac and the smartphone. Due to numerous positive reviews, I decided for the S7.Befor I but the purchase graduated, I tended to iPhone 7 Plus, since I was especially fascinated by the dual camera with wide-angle optics. The pictures look really nice, but there was a big disadvantage compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which I am very annoyed to this day: The PRIZE! At Telekom employees extended a contract, filled out papers and fortunately still the last copy of the iPhone Get 7 Plus 128GB Matt Black.Although the purchase was a significant loss compared to my previous contract renewals including mobile phone change, but this has paid off well! In the course of this review, I would like to discuss various aspects of the iPhone 7 Plus, which make the smartphone to something very special and equally interesting At the end, draw a conclusion regarding all the listed areas. Design: The iPhone 7 Plus is similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 6 Plus or the 6S Plus. It consists of a 5.5-inch screen and looks really beautiful. In contrast to the predecessors, the back of the iPhone was slightly changed. The antenna strips, which were clearly recognizable on the iPhone 6 Plus or the 6S, have finally been removed on the 7 Plus. This gives the iPhone 7 Plus a good impression and a nice look thanks to the beautiful black value, which really stands out in the eye and entices the user to want to hold the device in his hands. For me it is clearly one of the most beautiful smartphones that have been released on the market so far. But it gets me full marks, if one neglects the aspect of fingerprints! Homebutton: A new home button simplifies the condition on the iPhone and responds relatively quickly to the controls of the user. If the user presses the "sensor" button (a button does not exist anymore), the device generates a slight vibration, which redirects the device to the original home screen. Within the settings it is possible to interpret different sensitivities of the sensor which, when actuated, either cause a more intense vibration or completely switch it off. If you want to do without the Taptic engine, you can easily configure it in the settings, but personally I find the new home button to be very successful and offers you what the old home button could not do: it prevents the durability of the home button wears off over time. The Taptic Engine has been developed for future use to simplify the use of the device and prevent subsequent damage at high pressure.My homebutton at that time could no longer recognize the exact pressure force, so I was forced to increase the intensity, which of course was bad for the key. Now you can do without, because the new development regarding the sensor works really well. I really like the Homebutton and it makes the condition of the iPhone enormously easier Speaker: The new stereo speakers have really been provided with excellent acoustics, which sound even deeper and more intense deep bass in the individual, built-in speakers and make progress from the sound Has. My current ringtone is much louder as well as sonorous to hear, which is why many music genres are issued much clearer musically. I like the speakers very well. If you want, you can of course use the included headphones. The new A10 with 64-bit architecture and 3GB of memory give the iPhone again a strong performance boost over its predecessors by up to 50%. The iPhone runs like the world champion and scores a peak in the benchmark. Games and applications are presented very fluently and never fall into a jerk. Even appearing messages during gaming did not affect the speed of the iPhone under any circumstances. It responds wonderfully and seems to be drastically optimized compared to my iPhone 6 Plus. The quad-core processor handles various tasks quickly and safely. You definitely do not have to worry about that as a power user. Very good !!! Camera: The new dual camera with wide-angle optics offers a nice result in terms of the photos taken both inside and outside. The camera works relatively quickly and shows very good pictures even in low light conditions, but in bad light can ambiguous individual Verzehrrungen form, which at the expense of image quality, unfortunately, no longer offer what is normally expected of such a camera. Since I personally liked the shots on the S7 much better, but leave the pictures a great and high-quality impression. 4K videos are like the iPhone 6S possible and look amazingly good, especially if my 4K has suitable screen, with which you can marvel at the videos. For amateur photographers is certainly something good here! Personally, I use the camera relatively little, but I try sometimes times to deal with the creation of photos, as soon as good opportunities should occur.Akkulaufzeit: Strong processor, high memory, good speakers also take the battery power of the iPhone. Since I purchased the device only this afternoon, I can mention relatively little information at runtime. The iPhone had about 68% on the first launch. After 6 hours of use remained a remaining battery of 38%, which I think are good results for such an expensive smartphone. Apple promises in contrast to its predecessor up to an hour longer battery life, which I can not confirm, but I'm convinced that the information was really given correctly. If other evidence contradicts this statement, I add this retroactively to the recession.Otherwise, I'm very excited about the battery life for the already 6 hours. Let's see how much this changes after the fact. Memory: This time around, I was 100% sure that I would access a larger capacity than before with the iPhone 6 Plus, which has put a lot of strain on me personally in everyday life. I switched from the 16GB version to 128GB (ie: 112GB of additional memory), of which 120GB are available to the user when preinstalled applications like Keynote or Numbers are removed. Currently only 8GB including music, some photos, iCloud photo and transferred applications from iTunes occupied, which I was very excited about myself, since I can now claim the memory for memory-heavy applications and prove, without wasting a thought that possibly the memory exceeds its limits. If you should opt for an iPhone 7 Plus (especially for the iPhone 7 Plus), please consider whether 32GB is the right choice. After all, initially 4GB occupied by the system. Whether the purchase is worthwhile, everyone has their own thoughts about it. If you got along well with 16GB, where, for example, a small number of applications as well as small shots were created or only a few media libraries were continuously accessed, then the 32 GB could possibly cope. I recommend all other 128GB version (maybe even 256GB), since the new camera including the functions and applications nowadays take a lot of memory and the system could definitely slow down after a few months due to performance. The more data that is stored on the iPhone, the longer the loading time. Before buying, I ask everyone once to think about which variant applies to you, even if it is 100 € more expensive. Better to have more memory for safety and have no problems than to complain later and be forced to transfer data regularly or even remove. Such a thing disturbs in the long run and can cost a lot of time and nerves. 128GB should be for most standard. I do not regret the 128GB so far. Memory can not be expanded with the help of an SD card like its predecessors. Color: Usually I wanted to buy the diamond version of the iPhone, but users on the internet seem to complain that after a short period of 1 - 3 months, tiny traces of wear or even Yellowed deposits are formed so that the appearance of the iPhone is no longer the mint condition, as it was the case in the beginning. I must confess that the diamond version of the iPhone 7 Plus was no longer available and the seller has instead proposed the matte-black variant. On his advice, I accepted the offer and must confess that the color inspires me as much as the diamond version. For safety's sake, I use two bulletproof glass foils to prevent the device from making huge losses. This is a very expensive copy which I do not want to use "naked". Especially after 2 years Apple again offers an upgrade offer, where the old device can be exchanged for the new one. Significant traces of use, the estimated due to the serious and long-term use can fluctuate up to 50 €, which is a strong loss in my opinion.For the 6 Plus, I got from Telekom still 220 ¬. The 7 Plus will probably cost around € 300 to € 400 if I try hard to be careful. Maybe I'll buy a Case soon, although I like the iPhone quite well at the moment, despite the missing case. Let's hope that after a few months there are no surprises that would disappoint me very much of the product. Now we come to a point that bothers me a bit: The lack of headphone connection made for some users for reviews. The supplied adapter creates a remedy, but I would not like to pose in my spare time with an adapter that fills the trouser pocket again. How this manifests itself in practice, I learn only tomorrow on the train. I find it very disappointing that the headphone jack was left out, although I'm convinced I'm getting used to it. It is also criticized that the sound quality in combination with the adapter is reduced a lot. This, too, I can only determine from a later date. Whether Apple hereby want to draw attention to the wireless peripherals? Summary: Pro + High quality editing + Great new Homebutton + Great speakers + Excellent dual camera with great pictures + Good battery life + Beautiful color + iOS 10 with great new featuresKontra- Missing headphone jack camera images in low light conditions a little noisy Still, no NFC in Germany (Actually a pity: Hopefully this will be announced in the coming months) - High SAR value of 1.27W / KG (Whether this could have negative consequences for humans in terms of medical and biological development can Unfortunately, I do not confirm that, according to the German limits, devices with a maximum SAR value of 1.6 or 1.5 W / kg are dangerous but not life-threatening, so Apple could definitely have done more, but you can basically not have everything!) Conclusion: A successful smartphone if not even the best that Apple has to offer. The performance has exceeded all expectations, the camera offers good pictures and a good battery life for long-term users. The iPhone 7 Plus convinces in different areas and leaves a positive impression. The purchase of the device has paid off in my opinion, and can be recommended without any restriction. For those who can not decide between the iPhone 6S Plus and the 7 Plus, or 6S and 7: Always try the newest option into consideration pull. So you have a longer  support and can use all the features that already exist on the 6S, with the purchase of the 7 or 7 Plus further developed. Personally, I also wanted the 6S variant, as the 6 plus 2 years had accompanied me well and only an increased storage capacity was required, yet I opted for the iPhon 7 Plus to be surprised for the next few years with great new features and Benefit from the optimization in terms of performance and especially the dual camera. All users who use an iPhone 6 Plus should think about buying the 7 Plus. Owner of a 6S Plus I do not recommend the purchase, as the iPhone 6s Plus is still a top smartphone and can keep up with the competition. Owners of older models, "" can "think about a change, if performance losses or lack of storage are not in the obstacle. Otherwise: Clear Buy recommendation! Yours sincerelyChaosLeopard	1

The iPhone 7 Plus is not the nicest smartphone on the market. It may not be equipped with the fastest hardware. It may not have the best camera. But bottom line for me again the best device on the market. It's the many little things that make the device very good. The design is getting old. Nevertheless, I feel good again when you hold it in your hands. The processing is first class and still the measure on which the other providers must be measured. The display has "only" Full HD resolution, but the bottom line is very good. It is bright, crisp and sharp and has excellent color reproduction. The working speed is excellent. Everything "slips" and works as it should. What really stands out in comparison with the Mate 9, my previous smartphone. Open apps Fast, pages are displayed quickly. The Mate 9 was also fast, in most cases, but the iPhone 7 is simply faster. Or if it should be slower, it is cleverer that it works faster. The iPhone 7 Plus just works. In the car, on the ear, on the train, in the office. It always works when I need it. That was the main reason for the change. It works well in vehicles that change jobs because of regular traffic. Whether Audi, Seat, Peugeot, Skoda, Mercedes, the device is detected. Music is played via Bluetooth. The streaming works perfectly. The handsfree, so the phone, works right away. Important for me, working notifications, especially for emails and Threema. Unfortunately, that's what the Mate 9 did. There is nothing to complain about at the iPhone 7 Plus, it just works. Telephoning works first class. Crystal clear reception with the Vodafone network in the areas where I am staying. No disconnections, no complaints from my counterpart. So I expect das.Die built camera in the iPhone 7 Plus is good and stands out clearly from the Mate 9. Only the camera app of the Mate 9 I miss. But the picture quality, especially in darker situations, is much better. Not as good as my Note 7 or maybe the Pixel XL, but it's at an absolute top level. Battery life is remarkable. I can easily get over a day, despite much smaller battery compared to the Mate 9! What I do not like? The lack of 3.5mm connection I miss tremendously. I refuse the ugly Ear Pods and this stupid adapter is for the jack connection is a cheek. The camera sink, ugly like six feet dirt road. The price, just too high. But the iPhones are relatively stable in value compared to Android devices. Do I make the purchase? I miss a bit the beloved Android OS, just in its purest form. So on a Nexus or Pixel Smartphone. The Pixel XL was not available at the time, so it became the iPhone 7 Plus. To my surprise, a lot has happened on iOS too. So the surface was cleaned up a bit. The Maps app has gotten more features, similar to Google Maps, and the display goes off when you pick up the iPhone. Little things, just those little things in buzzer that make the device better than many other devices on the market. Even though I still miss my grade 7.	1
Know the moment when you open a bottle of red wine, smell it and think, "" It's going to taste so good "" Imagine you've never had a red wine before and just heard about it, it just tastes fantastic , You sip for the first time and realize: How could I have missed that for so long? So you feel like you own an iPhone, even as the owner of the whole product range. I myself was a skeptic for years and did not understand the hype about the Apple brand, but since I myself am owner and user of drs Ipads 1, the Ipads Air, the Imacs 27k, the Iphones SE, and since today Iphones 7 Plus, must I say: MY BRAND FOR LIFE. I do not want to go into any detail here, as many others do, but for the simple non-tech savvy, I want to make it clear that you just will not regret it. That's the point, why I can only say again: if you can, buy Apple products. Not to present a status but to be happy. You will not be disappointed.	1
What's new, neither the design nor the dimensions. Apple had become used to changing the look of the iPhone with each new generation. This is not the case here. IPhone 7 is the same as the iPhone 6 and 6S. Also, similarity between the 6S Plus and 7 Plus. No difference in terms of liability ... Except that these new arrivals are waterproof, that makes a big difference. As we have seen, they can safely be left in the pool, splashing and even dipping in water (1 meter deep) for 30 minutes, they still work. It is however to be allowed to dry for at least 5 hours before charging. But beware: like any waterproof electronic device, the water resistance is limited to freshwater. The main developments: - The main button is not mechanical, but detects finger pressure.- Analog audio output goes: you use a Bluetooth headset, go through the Flash-mini connector adapter or invest in a lightning hit helmet.- The battery provides greater autonomy, one to two hours more compared to the iPhone 6S depending on use.- Same design, cleared audio output- The same screen The more flattering- The same camera and brighter- Two goals for the iPhone 7 Plus- The sound in stereo, the same headphones in digital format- Faster and more generous battery processorConcentrate on two goals: The most spectacular development concerns that the iPhone 7 plus has two goals, a wide angle of 28mm and 56mm 2x zoom. Just tap the 2x icon to switch to the screen shown to enlarge it. Hold your finger down and drag, you can still take pictures up to 10X, but then the digital zoom takes over. The same system also works in video and in idle mode, fast, space and panorama.The idea is interesting: 2X, the subject appears closer, without the image through the grain and the possibility of the affected gradually zoom provides more freedom in video. However, the quality deteriorates when the zoom performance too, especially in low light. IPhone 7 And: like the zoom with two goals (Answer: good): Other manufacturers also take in the two goals, starting with the excellent Huawei P9 of the camera , and take the opportunity to add new features, such as blurring in the background or foreground. The iPhone 7 plus does not offer this option, but Apple will ensure that it will be available in a planned update in a few weeks. Reportedly, the camera may then emphasize the blur in the background, but will not be able to create a blur in the foreground. What I think ... If you want to summarize the main advantage of the new iPhone, we finally say "a waterproof iPhone." "This is the first Apple phone that is also resistant to splashing, which forced a bath in one meter of water. Nothing to worry about, so if the unit falls into the toilet bowl. For the rest, we discover some more anecdotal enhancements like the new main button, the stereo speakers, or brighter camera. The disappearance of the audio jack is not as terrible as that. First, because you always have to connect headphones to the adapter's flash mini Connection can connect, also because more and more people are using Bluetooth headphones and finally, because the audio quality is better, with headphones connected to the jack lightning which have their own digital converter. Finally, rather regret the lack of technology "" wow " ", or at least we would have better accepted if the iPhone 7 marked a break in terms of design. But this is not the case. The case is the same as the iPhone 6 and 6S. So it comes back to the most important innovation of this model: If you need a waterproof iPhone, iPhone 7 is an excellent choice. Other innovations will probably be in the iPhone 8.Also the end of 2018 appears iPhone 8, but who can not wait so long then I recommend iPhone 7 !!	1
After an unpleasant experience of a car accident resulting in an incomprehensible condemnation to a partial guilt, I informed myself about the possibilities of digital recording to substantiate disputed accident situations. Since I wanted a good image resolution and a certain compactness, I decided against a chunky digital camera and instead for this compact iPhone 7 Plus with additional phone function with suction cup windshield mount, especially since this dual camera had aroused my curiosity. After attaching to the windshield above my Steering wheel were my driving experience by the permanent sideways looking past the device holding the head rather painful nature. If this device turned out to be a little smaller, such compulsions would certainly be avoidable. However, the image quality convinced me a lot that I quickly took the decision to keep my iPhone. Only a so-called SIM card (as I later learned) was still missing to total happiness, as this unfortunately had not included the delivery. So I decided to visit my electronics store in the Neuköllner Karl-Marx-Straße. I bought this SIM card to finally use this phone function. But when I returned to my parking lot, a huge hole in my windshield gaped. The sucker and the phone were gone. Since I realized that I had not only imagined that with the high weight of the 7 Plus. Now I knew what the plus stood for. It was apparently broken by the heavy weight of the disc. I was sad about the now useless SIM. At home I had tears in my eyes. Not because of the loss, but rather because of the wind. I asked the honest finder and rescuer of my iPhone by newspaper advertisement to hand it over at the next opportunity in the lost property office. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting today. Maybe he will read this review.	1
From smartphone to iPhone ... I thought: publicly I can adjust all this myself (I 70) But lo and behold, it was easier than expected by good help, and you are pretty quickly familiar with the new system. I can only recommend it when you like Fotographiert.Potos are superAlso ... buy	1
I was so happy on the new iPhone 7 plus with 32GB memory. The next day has been delivered and since a month and numerous charges I can only say that the battery has a great runtime and quickly recharges. I'm very happy with it	1
Unbeatable in terms of price and performance	1
What a pleasure, the phone is just awesome. is very good in the hand. The picture quality is excellent. I have ordered a shell so that nothing happens.	1
So far, I have nothing to complain about, but in particular have no long-term experience. The battery life is very good.	1
iPhone looks like new, original packaging, super fast delivery, I loved it, iPhone works as it should, I would do it again	1
Good price	1
Apple iPhone 7 plus smartphone arrived quickly and in perfect condition with me. It is easy to use. I am very pleased. I can recommend it.	1
The switch from the 6s to the 7 plus was worthwhile. The significantly larger display represents a real added value; especially if you use the device intensively professionally and read many mails with attachments. That the processor is faster and the RAM is larger than in the 6s, you do not notice in normal operation. Both devices work (subjectively perceived) the same liquid. The sound is due to the stereo speakers much better and richer and you have a clearly audible stereo effect. The battery life is sensational. 1-2 days are easy in it, even with intensive use.	1
When I got the iPhone 7+ in October 2017 on Amazon, I was fascinated from the first moment. I had the 6s before, wanted to have a bigger and more powerful iPhone. The 7+ has everything in the usual good Apple quality: very good workmanship and handling, great camera, very good configuration, everything runs smoothly (at 6 s was often absolutely not the case!). Despite the size it fits well in the hand and can be operated with one hand (if you do not have little fingers). The adapter headphone port bothers me, unlike other users, not at all. You have to load it every other day, the 6s had to be loaded every day. Basically, I am convinced again and again of the Apple quality and operation, with Android, I would not cope! I am very satisfied and do not want another iPhone at the moment.	1
I am very satisfied with the phone! The pack was fine and still packed well! Except the headphones that have made, on hygienic reasons certainly! So I can only recommend!	1
I have chosen this review because the smartphone is very nice and great. That was big enough, easy and less expensive than in Italy. I recommend it to boys and adults	1
Top price. I do not need to write anything about the device, either you know and love Apple or not. Arrived undamaged and original packed.	1
Very fast delivery of the iPhone 7plus! Everything works great and the device is an original !!! Lies very well in the hand and makes great live photos! I can recommend to anyone here to buy a perfect IPhone 7plus at a great price compared to the Apple Store!	1
The device convinces with its complete package of excellent camera, large, bright display and simple and handy operation. The device has been in use for half a year now and runs as smoothly as on the first day, even if it happens once or twice before has fallen down. To the completely water resistance, I can not give any information. All in one, an absolute buy recommendation.	1
Simply the best smartphone in the world The camera is the absolute madness Very good workmanship as you are used to from Apple	1
The iPhone 7 Plus has replaced my 6s Plus. For the change were crucial, the new home button, the new camera with two lenses, the splash and dust protection, the brighter display, the higher working speed and the built-in stereo speakers. Initially, I thought I stick to my iPhone 6s Plus, because that was but quickly and the camera has made great shots. But after I got in the course of a contract extension, the iPhone 7 Plus and tested, the decision was made, the new features outweighed in daily use just clearly. The new home button including fingerprint sensor is much faster and has a crisp pressure point, which is only imitated by a slight vibration, a pressing is no longer taking place at all. This allows a much faster unlocking of the iPhone. The new dual-lens camera is now equipped with a larger aperture f 1.9 and a kind of telephoto lens. The larger aperture low-light images are possible because the larger aperture leaves more light on the recording sensor. The telephoto has a zoom level and zooms the subject about 50% closer, the quality of the recording suffers in terms of sharpness and detail. The new portrait function only works well in good light conditions, ie daylight and sunlight. In closed rooms, the iPhone and the subject must remain shake-free, otherwise the recording is rather blurred. Overall, the camera in the iPhone 7 Plus compared to the 6s Plus did not convince me 100%. I found the shots with the 6s Plus sharper and more contrasty. The sound of the two built-in speakers is clear and distortion-free, bass lack of volume, of course, not available, but a good surround sound at higher volume. The working speed of the iPhone 7 Plus is great, no jerking , everything runs smoothly and opens without delay. Also the reception and voice quality is perfect. WLAN and Bluetooth connect quickly with the respective peripheral devices, the transmission quality is also perfect here. The display, its sharpness, resolution and brightness is still State of the art, even in sunlight, it is easy to read. Overall, the iPhone 7 Plus is rated as very good, the aluminum back of the case contributes, I personally find it more robust and insensitive than a glass back.	1
My first Apple product. I'm thrilled, the attitude was a bit difficult because I did not know that, but with a little help, even beginners can handle this phone. The quality is awesome and the resolution of pictures is very good. The sound is very clear and loud. I am very satisfied and understand the hype around the iPhone now more than before. It's just something high quality.	1
== Background == As previously loyal Samsung customer and therefore Android users, IOS and thus an iPhone was never a topic for me. My last smartphone was the Galaxy Note 4, the anticipation of the note 7 was great, the rest should The decision, which I really did not find it easy to switch to an Iphone, was long thought out and should be quasi a pilot project for me. Below I will only comment on my experiences, technical details and comparisons can be found in the product description = The transition == Much easier and less complicated than expected.iPhone start - during the configuration "" Transfer data from Android "" - ready (free "" move to IOS "" previously download the app to the Android device) For iPhone Newcomers is the operation at first a little unfamiliar because new, after 3-4 days, but this is no longer a problem dar. My worries that I will miss the pen were in vain. Since one had the luxury of Samsung devices, the To expand memory via SD, I have decided for the 128GB version, since I've already used a SD in this size at the Note 4 (photos, music, movies, etc.). Whether the smaller version is sufficient, should be good at the purchase == The iPhone in everyday life == Yes, it looks really good, feels great, feels good in the hand and is certainly the best smartphone on the market Qualitatively. In the home Office I use only Windows and the interaction between PC and iPhone works flawlessly. Also, the applications installed on the iPhone such as Word, Excel Outlook, etc. run perfectly and are super to use. == Camera Battery, etc. == Absolutely terrific, there are There is nothing to criticize. The quality of the speakers is unique. You can compare this with any of my previous smartphones and it is really fun to watch videos on the device. The included headphones are also s strong and deliver a great sound. The screen is great and more than adequate. 4k or even higher-resolution display's on a smartphone are for me personally completely meaningless. Another luxury I thought to miss, namely the removable Akku.Nein, I do not miss it until now. With normal use of the iPhone, my battery can easily last a full 4 days - the biggest surprise for me. I've been a user of Google Play Music so far iPhone would be possible. After a short test phase of "" Apple Music "" Google was terminated. Operation and especially the structure of the Apple version is a lot better and clearer. == Conclusion == Who plays with the idea to dare a change from Android to IOS, that said, I can recommend it to anyone. Finally It's a matter of taste, because now the price no major differences are more recognizable. The added value but expected of Apple, is absolutely given. You immediately notice that you hold a top-of-the-range smartphone in your hands. I do not regret the change for a second.	1
After I've updated every year to the current version of the iphones, I could not resist this time and I ordered the 7 plus with 128GB at Telekom. This time it took quite a long time and with just under 3 weeks delay it was then delivered. After the 6 plus and 6s plus, the display is no longer really off the stool. The camera is ok, but now not so super outstanding, as praised in the press or advertised by this more for apple. Compared to the 6s plus, the pictures are a bit more lively and the switch from normal to 2x zoom is well resolved. Just 2 hours ago, apple released the beta version for profile photography and the first results are nice. Too bad that this feature, which was already advertised in the press (and actually could not be tested yet) was not on board from the beginning. That the homebutton is simulated does not really bother. Also, I can live with the omission of the latch, I'm not now the Walkmantyp. For me is more important wireless connectivity and works flawlessly in a recent Audi with the latest MMI, whether via Bluetooth to make calls, via bluetooth audio player or now also perfectly wireless via the MMI App. Also, the WLAN connection seems to have been improved again, in some corners of our house where I had only moderate reception, the reception is much improved. The stability of the ios 10 + update is good, so far I could not find a trailer. The scrolling in the e-mail app is also jerky with 10.1.1 .. I'm curious if now the problem with the battery performance is resolved, although I have everything on manual and the background balance off, the battery currently holds just under 25 -30 hours. The 6s plus with Ios 9.x easily lasts a day longer with similar usage. The 2nd loudspeaker makes itself clearly noticeable, the ringtone is clearly louder now. I see the much-praised improved design more soberly when the case scratched more heavily. And what brings me Diamantblack, if I have to pull a protective cover over it in 12 months, if necessary, again for a good price to sell again. My conclusion: Was there a real Wow in the jump from iphone 5s to 6plus because of the screen. A bit Wow, because of the live function at the 6plus on the 6s plus. So now you have the feeling to have a new iphone in your pocket, it is also recognized by the larger camera immediately, but somehow missing a bit the mega apple WOW despite more memory 128GB, stereo speakers, splash protection and improved cameras. I do difficult to award me 5 stars, maybe it is because the previous devices were already very good and the iOS 10 this time was thrown too fast on the market and the customer matures. Update to Update 10.1.1 .: The profile picture function is great , have tested these extensively today with our kiddies. Two images are saved, one with and one without depth of field. The pictures are really great. So here is the WOW experience again :-). Also, the battery is now much better. Within 20 hours since the update, the battery still has an output of 85%.	1
This is my first iPhone. I wanted to consciously have the plus, since I was convinced of the camera and am. I am quick and easy handling for me in the smartphone sector unequaled (until now). Especially moving shots look incredibly good (equestrian sports, dogs, etc.) .The portrait function is great, even if Apple was not the first company on the market there. Even in low light conditions, the camera conjures up good pictures that also please, without much needs to be edited. The handling takes some getting used to, because the size of the phone was not commonplace / is. Personally, I got used to it and also to the weight. Amazing, I find how easy then other smartphones are (eg my old SonyZ3 Compact or Nexus 4 and the 5s of my girlfriend). They also feel like doll phones and you think: Somehow cheap. The home button works wonderfully, quickly and accurately. Apps open quickly and generally iOS 10 can do a lot. Touch 3D was new for me as an iPad owner and now I have the hang of it. Brightness, images and operation are at Apple anyway at the highest level, so no deductions.128 GB had to be with me as a Spotify user. I do more videos than photos and that goes into the memory size violently. So you can also load apps that one needs only once, but still do not want to miss. Critically, I think the missing jack connection. At least I do not charge the iPhone and listen to music in parallel, but for the good headphones rauszuholen the adapter, sometimes annoys me. Meanwhile, I can live with it and also that is clear to any buyer before. I am also fascinated by the battery performance of this technology bomber. I spend 2 days relaxing with music, games, surfing and phoning. Charged the part is synonymous schnell.Empfehlen I can the leather case of Apple itself, it costs more, feels better processed and has saved me from harm. In addition, the glass sheet of Belkin (I think) and you have a round Schutz.Das subject price - Apple built performance and comparison with other manufacturers is irrelevant here, because I get nowhere such a package with other manufacturers. Whether IP67, IP68 IP LMAA is me Schnuppe, I do not shower with Phone and do not swim with it. Who buys an iPhone, knows what he gets and is willing to dig deeper into the bag.	1
I've been using the iPhone 7 Plus for several weeks now and would like to record my experiences for anyone who is thinking of buying one. First in a compact overview of the positive and negative impressions, then in detail .---------------------------------- --------- Positive impressions: (+) more environmentally friendly packaging (+) Scope of supply (power supply, charging cable, headphones and headphone adapter) (+) further developed design (+) new memory sizes (+) new home button (+) IP 67 Certified (+) Processor (+) Dual Camera * Sample images taken and edited by myself * (+) Display (+) Battery (+) Stereo Speakers (+) Accessories DiversityNegative Impressions: (-) Missing Headphone Jack (-) High Price (-) Display margins ------------------------------------------- <<< Packaging >> > The box is a cardboard box typical of Apple with a picture of the iPhone on the front and model information on the back. The cardboard box is wrapped in a plastic wrap. This year, less plastic has been used inside. Thus, the packaging is recyclable to a higher proportion, which I find very welcome. <<< Scope of delivery >>> The scope of supply includes, as always, a power adapter, charging cable, a pair of headphones with Lightning connector and a 3.5mm jack to Lightning adapter. In addition, as always, the paperwork and Apple stickers are included. <<< Design >>> The design is based on the predecessor models iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus. The case is made of anodised aluminum as in the last years. New features are the offset antenna strips, a new dual-camera system and the omitted headphone jack. Although that only sounds like minor changes, the device looks like a completely new design, at least in the case of my iPhone 7 Plus in matte black. The antenna strips are color matched so that they almost disappear and in the color (dull) black, the iPhone can optically somewhere between elegant and wicked classify. <<< Memory >>> 16 GB finally fall away and with memory sizes of 32, 128 and 256 GB is the right size for everyone. Please note that the read and write speeds of 128 and 256 GB are faster than those of the 32 GB version, which is noticeable in everyday life but at most when syncing with iTunes -> videos are available on YouTube <<< Homebutton >>> The new Solid State Homebutton is one of my new favorite features because it is superior to the old mechanical Homebutton in everything and is comparable to the Force Touch trackpad of the current MacBook models. It reacts faster, is less prone to wear and contributes to IP67 certification. I love it after a short period of getting used to. <<< IP67 certification >>> Even if Apple does not guarantee water damage, the IP67 certification (30 minutes at up to 1m depth waterproof) calms me a lot. Although I would not deliberately go into the water on the basis of several testimonials on YouTube, I feel much more comfortable now when it rains in torrents, so I am near water or take it in the bathtub. In addition, it is completely dust-proof. <<< Processor >>> Apple's new A10 Fusion chip, in conjunction with 3GB of memory, is a real powerhouse, outperforming all its competitors in benchmarks.In everyday use, you immediately notice that the computing power of this smartphone is enormous. Nothing jolts or hangs and even the most elaborate games, such as "Infinite Blade III", run absolutely smoothly. <<< Dual Camera >>> The new camera with two lenses and sensors puts everything that has been on a smartphone into the shade. As usual for an iPhone, the color reproduction is absolutely phenomenal and extremely realistic, which I really like. Due to the two cameras (28mm and 56mm) a loss-free zoom of 2x is possible with the "Telelinse" u and it will be less awkward to shoot medullary shots. With the new portrait mode, in which both cameras work together with the software to produce depth of field similar to a SLR camera, you can take very nice photos *** I upload some of my sample images - all are unedited, like the iPhone it has recorded *** <<< Display >>> The new 5.5-inch display still resolves in full HD, but can clearly represent more colors, has a better black level and is significantly brighter in automatic brightness mode than its predecessor , It's a lot of fun to watch movies, play games, to read and what else to do on a display. <<< Battery >>> The battery is with 2915 mAh, although much smaller than many Phablet competitors, convinces me however in the everyday life to 100%. With moderate to heavy use, I still have 10% - 20% left over at the end of the day, and with light to moderate usage, I can even come up with a single charge for more than two days. <<< Stereo Speakers >>> A speaker is on the bottom as usual , a second sits in the earpiece of the iPhone. They are louder than those of the last generations and produce a more balanced sound with beautiful heights, mids and even some basses. <<< Accessories >>> As with every generation, there are again this year a tremendous amount of accessories such as covers, protective films and all kinds of other things your heart desires, which is an advantage that you only have with the iPhone and no other smartphone in this way. Here are my favorites from this year (as of 31/10/2016): - Leather and silicone shells of Apple Apple MMYJ2ZM / A iPhone 7 Plus Leather Case black - Display film of Dipos 2x dipos Glass bulletproof film iPhone 7 Plus protective plastic glass 9H <<< missing headphone jack >>> I am a shatterer of the future and think it is a good decision from Apple to omit the headphone jack to promote wireless solutions. BUT the included Lightning headphones and the Lightning headphones are just too clunky, but have not found any suitable Bluetooth headphones <<< wide display edges >>> The display edges make the case unnecessarily large and should be smaller in my opinion. <<< Price >> > The price is like every year very high and leaves a big hole in your wallet, at least you get compared to last year for the same price twice as much memory and the support is also a lot better than most other companies in the smartphone market , But it is probably an evil, which one must accept for the many benefits .-------------------------------- ----------- <<< CONCLUSION >>> The iPhone 7 Plus is a very good development of an already very good smartphone and has caught up with this generation a big step on the Android competitors and they in some areas even outdated. The best price performance in my opinion offers the 128 GB model. From me a clear buy recommendation.	1
Best iPhone ever, had already different models such as 3g 3gs 5s 6plus but stands out the 7 plus with its camera, performance and the display. Besides, you do not have to worry if it falls into the water	1
I recently got my first iPhone. Since I'm used to bigger smartphones on Android, it has become the 7 Plus, with 5.5 inch Bilddiagonale.Auf the data sheet, I would not go into, but briefly describe my impressions as Umsteiger.- Case: I have that 7 Plus in matte black. From the processing I am thrilled, the aluminum housing looks great and feels worthy. The antenna strips of the predecessors have almost disappeared. As a screen background, I use the unofficial dark fashion, the device is described on various websites. As a result, the iPhone is completely in black, looks chic. The disadvantage of the 7 Plus is in relation to the screen very large frame and the high weight compared to the Android competition. It is similarly slippery in the matte version as the Samsung S7 Edge operating system: Before my device was delivered, I was looking for iOS operation tips. It should be limited to the current iOS 10 or possibly 9, as of course always something changes. There are YouTube videos, web pages and also magazines. Typical processes, like e.g. switching from the photo gallery to the camera is pretty fast. The 7 Plus runs very smoothly with 3Gb memory. For the first time I use the iPhone fingerprint sensor, which I'll use permanently - because it works so fast and reliably , That was a key reason for buying an iPhone. At Sammy, I disabled it at some point. Also, the location of the device can be set up quickly and I do not have to google the best third-party app for it. When surfing with the Androids there were incidents where I did not trust the device properly. Since I am online banking u.a. I prefer to reset it to factory settings. The security apps, I do not trust so much. On the PC (good security software provided) and iPhone I feel better protected. Installed apps ask the iPhone on the first start, if they annoy me with notifications. Homebutton: Since this is my first Apple Smartphone is, I can not compare to the homebutton of the predecessor. I think it's better to have one, so I was a Samsung user before. With the 7 Plus the intensity of the vibration feedback can be adjusted and I work quite relaxed with it. If it is to be more durable than the older models, I like to take it.- Camera: The camera app starts almost as fast as the Samsung competition. I've set the iPhone so that it displays the lock screen on the Uplift, a short swipe from right to left, the camera is ready to go, zack.Entgegen some "tests" I see the quality of the photos in daylight at least on par with the Galaxy S7. Samsung recognizes the colors of the scene and then neatly pops in the color intensity. Apple is more neutral here. Fine details like leaves and branches are not sharpened and are less pixelated on the iPhone.The autofocus is the Galaxy S7 faster sharp.Größter disadvantage with Samsung S7 is the very short range, which is sharply displayed. This is only a few meters, everything before and after is increasingly blurred. When taking pictures of buildings along the street that is not always desirable, in portraits already. Not a photographer, probably has to do with the larger aperture. The Galaxy S6 did not have this so extreme, as well as the iPhone is better here. At low-light, the quality of the iPhone 7 Plus is significantly better than that of Samsung. The color reproduction is much more realistic. Samsung photos often become extremely yellowish, colors of e.g. Plants are intensified too intensely for the lighting conditions. In addition, details on the iPhone do not disappear as quickly in the Pixelmachsch as with Samsung. Images of the iPhone get a little brighter and show more details. The decimal place at the aperture size brings Sammy no advantage here. Photos in raw format are possible. Note: The "zoom lens" is an asset in good lighting conditions and a reason to buy the larger model. In the dark, however, only the wide-angle lens is used and enlarged digitally. So here better refrain from it or snap with / without zoom and compare. The portrait mode with the blur effect should be redone, example images on the net looked very good to me.- Other: Who does not need the camera features, not to use the desktop mode for surfing or iPhone with one hand, possibly drives with the 4, 7 "better. Try it! - The battery is quite strong and is in no way inferior to the Galaxy. The loading times are longer than the Samsung. After the Samsung Note 7 embarrassment, I'm glad too. The S7 Edge, I was already worried when I installed a BS updates while loading. It was always warm, but the appliance was almost cooked. It was not that extreme on the older Samsung models. - Clever how to use Siri. I find it helpful.- Most Google Apps are available, eg: Chrome, Music, Translate and Maps.- My recorded TV series I get from the PC easier on the device, as I first thought. VLC Player App, do not need to convert, copy and sync with iTunes right there in the VLC menu item, only the first time unfamiliar, then it's quite simple. Conclusion: The transition from Android to Apple was quite simple. I'm very happy with the iPhone and I do not feel I have to constantly switch between the Android manufacturers, because one could have reinvented the wheel. The protection against access from the outside and also within the operating system / Apps is now clearly better. iPhones are quite expensive, if it does not have to be the latest, possibly buy used and unlocked predecessor model.	1
I have the phone for about 3 months and I am simply thoroughly impressed, the camera is just fantastic, the touch screen responds immediately and I have never had (with no Apple device) problems. no failures ... nothing !! Recommended for 100000%	1
Yes at the beginning, I am only on Apple for years. iPhone, Watch, iMac, Macbook Pro ... The first I read here reviews such as, (Blitzer defect / lamp, camera broken, no AUX connection, network problems?! Have since the iPhone 4 every iPhone so far, had of the still never a problem ... no AUX connection? Yes Apple does it and the rest copies it next year ... the camera is just bomb, and BUT it has 4K man only need to activate it under settings / photos camera at the honk of that did not know but ne bad Resension raushaut .. from the security synonymous as always s.besten, Noble Design, suitable for any age, in use with Mac OS etc. Also unsurpassed, I have never had one of the problems of strange because 1. Stern Resensionen, how about a simple Case / Folie ?! Oh well the smart people ...	1
I got my iphone7plus 128GB just 2 weeks ago and i must say that it's a wonderful smartphone. It's really fast, the battery life is surprisingly very good, the dual camera system is a game changer, specially the portrait mode acts like a professional DSLR Camera, it's also performing real good at the low light. The stereo speaker system is good, which makes me want to watch more movies or TV series on my phone. The new home button is of course different than the older iphones, but I got use to it and i even like it more than the older ones, And yes, i know that it's got no headphone jack but I'm happy with the lightning port. I guess I'm going to buy a pair of Bluetooth earbuds.Oh by the way, iPhone isn't exploding like a Galaxy Note7 ;)These photos are shot using iphone7plus Zoom lens	1
In the following report, I would like to pass on my experience with the iPhone 7 Plus. I chose the 32GB version in the color silver. Packaging: The packaging is typical as you know it from Apple. On the front is now the back of the respective In addition, the box is now wrapped in a plastic wrap, which you can raise by means of a tab. Scope of delivery: The scope of supply has changed this year almost nothing. In addition to the power plug, Lightning cable and the Lightning headphones is this time because of Something of a pity I find that the headphones (and the adapter) this time only in a cardboard holder and not as usual in a small Plastikbox.Design: The design has changed in this year, hardly anything most of them we have exactly the same design as the iPhone 6 Plus and 6S Plus. The biggest changes are the antenna strips on the back, which are now embedded in the upper and lower edge. The two black color variants are hardly noticeable, in the silver color version you can see them, but not as clearly as before. The slot of the earpiece was also slightly longer However, I could not exactly check this. The changed design of the camera is also immediately auf.Sowohl the dual camera in the 7 Plus and the normal camera in the iPhone 7 are still outstanding Dimensions of the iPhone 7 are exactly the same as the predecessor. The iPhone 7 Plus is now 4 grams lighter, but this difference is not noticeable. The design is as usual good, but I would now after 3 years again wish a completely new design In any case, it would be good if the screen edges become narrower in the future. Processing: Also this year the iPhone is again top processed. The iPh one is made of aluminum and it is high quality processed. It feels really very good in the hand. Also, the loud / quiet button, the on / off switch and the mute switch are very well processed.It does not wobble at all and the pressure points are also very comfortable. Memory: The iPhone is available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB memory sizes. If you like watching movies offline and often shoot videos, especially in 4K, then you should look at each one Case for a larger memory option decide.Ich even with 32GB memory handle very well, since I leave only apps and pictures permanently stored on the device. When I turn videos, then I always transfer this to the computer to save memory. Here you can each decide for themselves, how much memory for the personal user experience are fitting. Missing jack connection: One of the most discussed and criticized characteristics of the new iPhone is the lack of jack connection. I can understand all which are disappointed about it and criticize the missing connection. In the direct comparison the new included Lightning headphones the same music quality as the EarPods mi All I tested headphones with a jack connection have worked with the included adapter right away. The look of the adapter does not look so appealing, but it works reliably so far. Home button: The home button is also one of the innovations of the iPhone 7 / Plus.Optically, there are no differences, but the new home button can no longer be pressed in. The Taptic Engine generates a vibration due to a small motor, which can be felt when pressed. The intensity of the feedback can be changed in 3 steps. At the beginning maybe it's still a bit unusual, but you get used to it quickly.Me like the new home button better than the old Homebutton.Ein fingerprint sensor is also integrated back into the home button.This works just as fast as its predecessor.Water and StaubErstmals the iPhone is after IP67 water and dust protected. 30 minutes under water at a low e of 1m, the iPhone should now survive unscathed. Display: The display is as well as its predecessor very very good. The resolution is at 1920 x 1080 gleichgeblieben.Der color gamut was increased by 25%, also the brightness was increased by 25%.In addition, the viewing angles are very good. Everything looks a bit better than the iPhone 6S Plus. The 25% higher brightness is only used when the brightness control is set to "Auto" and the iPhone is very bright Pressing on an appsymbol will open a window for various shortcuts. IOS10 has further improved its functionality. Speakers: For the first time, 2 loudspeakers have been installed which should provide stereo quality A speaker is located as usual on the bottom, the second speaker emits the sound through the earpiece. It makes sense in any case, that now two speakers were installed. The sound is now much clearer and it makes much more fun videos to watch and listen to music. Battery: Although the battery is 2676 mAh slightly smaller than that of the iPhone 6S Plus (2700mAh), but thanks to the new processor, it keeps up a bit longer. Who already came through the day well with the iPhone 6S Plus, will have no problems here. Two days are also possible if you use the battery In direct comparison with the iPhone 6S Plus, the battery actually lasts a little longer. For me, the battery life is definitely satisfactory. Performance: The new A10 Fusion processor and 3GB of RAM are used on the iPhone 7 Plus. IOS10 is preinstalled. Everything runs very smoothly. Whether switching between apps, opening apps, zooming, wiping and scrolling, everything runs very smoothly and quickly. Ruckler I could not determine yet. Even very complex games run smoothly. In general, the noticeable difference to the iPhone 6S Plus but not so huge. Camera: The iPhone 7 Plus is a dual camera used. This consists of a Telelinse and a Wide lens. In addition, a double optical zoom möglich.Das switching the zoom level by pressing a button on the Display.Die pictures with the new camera make a very good impression. Both the colors and the contrast are even better than the iPhone 6S Plus Colors are beautiful, of course. Also in low light conditions, the camera makes much better pictures. One can really make first-class shots. The portrait mode is not yet available, but should be submitted later this year by update. This mode is only for the iPhone 7 Plus available. The front camera has now a resolution of 7 megapixels. The quality of selfies is thereby again a little better. Skyping or phoning by facetime also works in very good quality. The video quality is synonymous positive hervorzuheben. 4K recordings are possible again and the optical Image stabilizer is also used again. This makes it very easy to move Whether taking nature shots, videos from and with friends or videos from the family, the camera delivers very good results. Conclusion: Even at Apple, we are experiencing no revolution this year, but a very good improvement in many areas. The new Camera makes excellent pictures and videos, the new home button is also very good. However, the missing jack connection could be a problem for one or the other. Owners of older iPhones can change without hesitation. Owners of an iPhone 6S Plus should think twice about whether the innovations Surcharge worth. You get without a doubt a very high quality processed smartphone which is one of the best devices on the market today.	1
My new 7er plus in diamond black makes visually very much ago. But also the inner values ​​convince. The camera with zoom brings objects as close as you know only from system cameras ago. The new functions work confidently, although I have not yet tried out the splash-protection suitability for safety's sake. Now I'm still waiting for the new headphones - the EarPods and then I'm smartphone moderately up-to-date first. And then can only hope that the developers in Cupertino finally the neglected dinosaurs of their product range, the MacBooks again a little more Pay attention, so that they can technically match the new iPhone standard again.	1
Fast delivery! No defects available! Everything works!	1
For many years I have mostly had high class android. But the update policy of Samsung and Co. had annoyed me more and more and so I switched to Apple 4/5 years ago and have never looked back since. I currently use an X, my wife a 6S Plus and our daughter a 6s and we are all enthusiastic Apple fans and if Apple maintains its update policy, then it will probably remain so many years!	1
I think the iPhone is very cool and schön.Es has really worth it to buy the iPhone.Display ok. The device feels like new and has only very few signs of wear and is like new. Very fast delivery ... There was indeed comes on Thursday, 16 August - Saturday, 18 August, which was actually already there after a working day, ordered on Sunday and on Tuesday already!

What should I write great? The iPhone 6S arrived as original packaging within the specified delivery time and works flawlessly. So: Everything is fine	1
I opted for the iPhone 6s in rose gold (32gb). I was very worried after reading the reviews far too late. When it arrived yesterday (delivery time 1 week), I have not unpacked it, but only have it checked by a friend, if it is actually eon new device and no usedest! It was a nail new. It was immediately unpacked and installed. Of course there were initial difficulties, since this is my first iPhone! It's easy to handle and I wonder why I did not get one before! The sale went smoothly and it was a good decision! Any time ! Where do we hope that the iPhone is still years with me!	1
Do not understand the other comments, I got an original iPhone 6s with 128GB. At first honestly had doubts because I was not sure if Amazon really sells original ones (especially so cheap!). But this can be confirmed with satisfaction. Everything works one-way, no damage and with all the accessories. Any time! : D	1

It was new and not a refurbished iPhone sent. Now the yearlong dream of a girl has been fulfilled.	1

Was described as like new "" and this is indeed the case. I'm very happy, except for a software hanger, if you click on the restriction function, it takes a little time to get it called. I hope all parts are original.	1
What should one say in addition? Better than this smartphone you can not do it. And the included EarPod headphones are really worth the 179 euros !!!!! Insanity.	1
no visible damage or signs of use - makes a very good impression and is much cheaper!	1

Since I already knew the iPhone, there were no surprises here. As desired, just stop an iPhone.	1
Was satisfied with my iPhone SE but it broke (screen). This iPhone 6s cost with 128GB storage capacity and a larger screen less than the previously purchased iPhone 5 SE with barely 16 GB storage capacity.	1

Although definitely a non-Apple fan, I have to admit that this iPhone, like the 4th and 5th generation, is also very well made and high quality - lucky in view of the high price, which corresponds to two well-equipped notebooks for Windows. Despite very intensive use of the battery after a year - according to the battery test app Tkozyk - still 86% efficient. I think that's not bad after certain 500 charges. Top is the good, understandable and clearly adjustable system, the fast and secure fingerprint sensor, the small problems in the case of updates, the high security of the system against malware and the huge selection of useful apps. If you use the phone a lot for music, short work processes, navigation (HERE on / offline navigation), logbook, photos, ebooks, news release and various messenger / social platforms, you should definitely invest the money for 128 GB of storage , as a retrofit iPhone is not known to be possible. The only alternative (in my view), the technically good Windows Phone platform, has been completely disqualified by Microsoft's unreliability to buyers who have repeatedly been left standing in the rain with their devices without updates, and I personally only advise Android People who like to grapple with multi-faceted systems, imho's unspeakable espionage, and viruses. I had several times for a short time Android Mobildevices (tablet and mobile phone) and found to my astonishment after years still in my Google account, the website addresses that I had viewed several years before with these, although I had tried on the Devices to set the best possible privacy options. The data could be deleted, but this was awkward - an experience that I remember unpleasant. I mention that, because of such experiences, I am quite willing to pay the high extra price for the iPhone, here you can completely do without Google apps, which I would recommend privacy-joyous benefits.	1
The iPhone came as ordered. I had dubbed the data backup of my old iPhone with good instructions from the Apple Suport and was able to start directly without any problems. So you want a new purchase.	1
Looks like new, loads in no time, the battery lasts longer than many claim, has swallowed all the data from the old phone easily and has the first updates behind it.	1
iPhone? jo, you can make it is great too! Well-known quality that you paid a lot for the name and the software would also be clear. But quality you have to pay now! Who buys cheap, buys two times.	1
The iPhone is just great, I love it! It looks good, has optimal picture quality and makes great photos.	1
Top mobile! Battery is very good and who knows iPhone does not want anything else ... but you certainly know that. Although it is a UK version but that is not bad ... the only difference is the charging station ... or. The plug! Otherwise, it is exactly the same phone as a D version! The plug is included with most sellers.	1
Turbo fast delivery! A mini-scratch. Everything else was perfectly fine: the price, looks, features, features; Smartphone was even preloaded and ready to use. Now the seller is recommended.	1
The iPhone 6s was delivered in top condition! Looks like new! All accessories were new and unused. Our daughter got it for Christmas and is super satisfied. Works impeccably. The latest software was also installed. Shipping went smoothly, punctually and without problems. Commendable seller!	1
I have been looking forward to it for a long time and it exactly matches my expectations is a pleasure in the operation and in the playback	1
Just a great phone! I had an Android device before and am really surprised how easy it is to use iOS! Completely content :)	1
The phone just arrived as expected. Perfect iPhone I ever used. A brand new iPhone as good as every other iPhones. : )	1
Top delivery, works well, the camera is also very good, makes beautiful photos, the quality of an IPhone, I was always convinced. Everything is now top	1
For used and the price good quality just a scratch my buddy is very easy and satisfied it would immediately buy again seller reliable recommendation	1
What can I say? Is just a new iPhone! I think the devices are first class and they fit extremely well into my system. About the noble design and the exemplary processing I do not need to lose many words. For me, the iPhones are worth every penny.	1
I decided some time ago to buy a new phone because my old Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 after 4 years but slowly made problems (crashes, battery lasts barely half a day, etc.). Since I no longer play games or generally play around with the phone, it should now be an iPhone. The "" restrictions "" the Android users often complain I do not care, because I use the phone only for writing, surfing, telephoning and working and the iPhone offers more than enough possibilities. So now to the phone: I come with one Battery charge without problems 3 days out, what has surprised me in comparison to the previous cell phone really extreme and above all positive, so ever a first Pluspunkt.Desweiteren iPhone is really extremely fast, in all respects. It's up in 13 seconds, and open all the apps with the press on it, there is virtually no waiting. What I think is cool is the new Taptic engine, so the vibration motor, which works very well, beautiful Vibration Vibrations ... it I would not have cared if the 6S had not had him, but if she is there I will not say no. Now to the main innovations I think very well, makes very good pictures, very true to color and triggers with the pressure directly, again no waiting time , The video functions are also very cool, something like slow motion, time lapse, etc. Recording 4K or in FullHD / HD with 120 / 240FPS is synonymous top.Was, however, for me one of the main arguments for the iPhone 6S was the 3D touch function. I actually use it all the time and it works perfectly too. Especially to quickly call favorite contacts or directly create a new event in the calendar. When writing, I also use the function instead of the magnifier to jump between letters back and forth. The change between Android and iOS was super easy, because of the Move to iOS app, just connect mobile phones and all data, pictures, contacts, etc. are transmitted "I'm very happy with the iPhone, although I'm not an Apple fan. It really works very well, that you have to leave him. I think the price is set much too high, but nowadays, unfortunately, everything costs a lot of money, which is good in terms of quality and functionality.	1
What should I write: For Apple fans even hornier. It has a bigger camera (more pixel resolution), is faster, better, bigger ... I agree with my predecessors.	1
So after a week of use of this really great iPhone I have to say I'm really excited. In the beginning I give some quite in terms of the battery of really, but ONLY at the beginning of the first 3 days very quickly went empty. The battery must first are used and after a week I get along very well with him throughout the day and have in the evening still around 50%, with 5 hours of continuous use and 4 hours of standby that is more than okay. To the software you need not say much except It is really great and fast. Camera is top. All in all, everything works as it should and is totally worth the price if you consider paying in the shop over 800 € for it.	1
The iPhone 6s 16GB in black was delivered very fast and corresponded to the description (no SIM lock or Gebrausspuren). The device is very good in the hand and makes a high-quality impression. After about 1 month of use, no real weaknesses are clear the device runs very smoothly with iOS 10.1 and there was no time for jerks or long load times. The 16GB of memory is sufficient for normal use very well, but who has saved a lot of music on the device is more likely to a 32 / 64GB model The Fingerbadrucksensor works contrary to the expectations very well, it detects in about 95% of the cases the finger on the first attempt what the unlocking of the device significantly accelerates and represents a particularly great benefit for me. The battery holds on average one Day (6-17 clock) with normal use (Internet, music, app use) and usually loads in 1-1.5 hours to 100% auf.Für each one reliable Looking for a smartphone that is easy to use for everyone should think about buying an iPhone.	1
I had to first consider, because the delivery date was not fixed when I acquired it. However, the phone arrived in the packing station before the announced delivery date. It was originally packaged and could be installed like any other normal iPhone. The new features I test only gradually, so I can unfortunately not write anything. All in all, I am satisfied with the delivery and the mobile phone.	1
Apple-loving household, what else do you want to write? The 6s has replaced a Sony with Android. In my opinion, Apple still has the crown on. It does not get any better.	1
top goods, top quality, quickly received, gladly again, price performance here, habs replaced because it was broken, top amazon service, Best regards, happy	1
The mobile phone was delivered quickly. Could until the receipt of the goods do not believe that I should have gotten the brand new IPhone 6s 64gb actually for only 575 euros. But that was so! An absolute bargain! Am completely satisfied!	1
Very good until now, everything is very well down to the price but Apple is just generally too expensive but as long as we idiots buy the products for the price, we blame ourselves, we should all beukottieren Apple once a year	1
This iPhone is also easy to use for older people, the Bedienug is like the Apple iPad, I can recommend everyone	1
My daughter has switched from a Galaxy S3 to this new model. Really nice and noble design and good processing. Of the functionality was just a bit of getting used to, as the Apple is indeed a little different than the Android device. From the battery life, there is no difference to the Android.Auch the camera we like very well. Really crisp pictures. Also that one can select the resolution, we like very well!	1
Oh dear, I had ordered the Galaxy S7 Edge Edge because I had been looking forward to it forever. Then after a few weeks but again bought an iPhone, Samsung just has it on it and Apple is again n1 and it will probably stay synonymous if it continues. Top Cell Phone I love it and do not want another one anymore. Only recommended. For beginners as well as professionals :)	1
I have my iphone6s for several weeks now and I am very excited! The operation is super easy, I did not like the switch. With my old Xperia SP you really can not compare, there are worlds in between: D Top Camera, especially the front camera! Screen quality is also very good and the battery lasts long synonymous with me! I'm very satisfied - Apple just! :)	1
Already had an iPhone 6 and now I have the iPhone 6s increased, was already satisfied with the 6, unfortunately I had this with too little memory bought (never happens again). The delivery was fast and good!	1
I'm very happy with the iPhone 6s. Taking gold was also the right decision. Performance is impeccable. Data is as described at Apple.Verkauefer what synonymous super. Delivered very fast. I would buy it again.	1
The product arrived much faster than expected. It was in an original i phone packaging unopened and with all the accessories. Therefore, I have nothing to complain about and can recommend it	1
Ordered iPhone arrived very fast with us. Ordered Wednesday afternoon, delivered on Monday morning (Unfortunately, UPS does not deliver on Saturdays, but was not problematic for us.) Goods were also very well packed and therefore nothing damaged. New iPhone instantly charged, and has been running without any problems. Therefore, full marks. What more do you want?	1
I bought the iPhone 6s in rose gold 5 days ago! Came super fast, on Wednesday it was already there. In the first few days I was afraid that the phone will fall down ...... The phone is big, if you had a Samsung (I had Samsung Galaxy Core Prime) you have to get used to it :) But still really great made! 3D Touch is beautiful and the phone is filming exactly! I'm really proud of it :)))))	1
The mobile phone from Appel is known to be exorbitantly expensive, but the operating system and the device itself is already very solid. But if you want to make calls only with modern technology, you should save the money.	1
I do not need to write anything anymore for the mobile, so far it's just great! Whether Apple or Android, everyone has to decide for themselves and I also like Android! If the pricing policy of Apple continues to run, Android will have the edge, the technology is not worse there!	1
It could not be better. The software is perfectly matched to the hardware. As a result, the iPhone works fast and efficiently. The Apple devices harmonize and convince in terms of compatibility on the track. The dialogue with iTunes is very good. Likewise, the processing and the haptic, as usual, great. For an end user who needs a smartphone as a multi-talent in all multimedia areas, the iPhone 6s is unbeatable. Apple is and remains for me due to the aforementioned facts my absolute favorite.	1
Everything great! I can only recommend! Mobile came super fast and without problems. To answer the question of many potential customers, the mobile phone has no branding.	1
The operation is very simple and graphics and performance are very convincing. The pictures with the camera can really be seen and the battery is also very strong. So for me a great device!	1
It's Apple, you have to like it. Pros: Grandiose camera, great operating system, nice design, 3D touch, fast fingerprint sensor, good display.Kontra: price, large display edges, officially not waterproof,	1
The iPhone knows almost no signs of use. It looks like new. The battery is holding up pretty well and has apparently been renewed. I have to say I am very happy with the purchase. Only the 7 days shipping was a tick too long.	1
I have only reordering the many bad reviews read. I was unsure and feared that the product would not correspond to the description. All buyers who allegedly bought a new iPhone from this dealer have received a used product. Now I got the iPhone 6s in gold with 32 GB on time as described and the product is new. Therefore, I can not confirm the many bad reviews with me everything is fine I would buy at this dealer again.	1
All very well, after initial concerns, as dealer sits in France, all positive. But only interesting for private persons, as no VAT is shown.	1
I already had many Apple products (iPod shuffle, iPod touch, iPhone 4, iPhone 5 and iPad mini 2). After a long deliberation, I have now separated from my beloved iPhone 5 after 2 years and ordered the iPhone6S. I'm incredibly happy with this decision. The iPhone is as always great to use. Only the design I do not like as much as the iPhone 5, reminds me too much of Samsung but that's a matter of taste. The 3D Touch is a very funny feature but not vitally necessary. All in all, Apple has outdone itself again. For Apple fans clearly recommended. For newcomers to the beautiful world of apples: do not despair;) iTunes is not that difficult.	1
came before the day which i expected and works well. i suggest every customer to buy it without any hesitation	1
Excellent! It is a very good product, it arrived on time and I do not have any complain. I will more products here again.	1
Very good indeed. I'm writing from it now. A little scratch on the back. But nothing relevant . Gray ho	1
A dream. Even if I was not an Apple disciple before, I will gradually to this. For all Mac users a great connection. Telephoning and texting, without the phone is next to it. The camera replaced in some cases, the DSLR, of course, not comparable, but in my opinion better than many others, which I was previously experienced. In addition, the battery keeps in moderate use a good two days, which is also better than, for example, the HTC one mini 2. It fits well in the hand and worked fine with me so far. Recommendation on my part is given. Of course, you have to decide if you want to spend the money for it. As always with Apple it is overpriced. I would always advise to 64 GB version, since with 16GB probably most quickly reach their limits.	1
Everything worked out great. Really only very minor traces of wear on the left side. Otherwise the phone was completely fine.	1
I have the phone since January 2016 and I'm still very excited ... I was important that you can make useful photos with your cell phone, because you do not always have a camera mithat ... I am very enthusiastic ... sometimes let I also work out on 13x18 size, top quality (sharpness, colors everything fits) .... Videos are also very nice ... Now there are in a few days, the new Iphone 7 but I think that's enough reacts fast ... really a top mobile ... Have the color in silver with 64gb (unfortunately 16gb barely enough) ... Have uploaded a few more photos. in bad light it is better with lightning without being usable but not so good.	1
I would like to get rid of a few sentences for the 6s after over two years of use. For me, the 6s was the best smartphone on the market at that time and is still a good device today. No comparison to Samsung, LG, HTC and Co. The relatively high price is reflected in quality and functionality again and of course you pay for the name. After intensive use, it still looks like new and running smoothly, even with iOS11. You just have to keep the system clean, it does not mean superfluous apps and also make the necessary settings. I did not have a crash or other problems in over two years. Now and then an update or update. This can be an annoying story on Android devices, constantly any updates and hiccups. Pointless apps that can not even be deleted, etc. ... Only the battery gets cold in the cold, but Apple offers a free exchange program for affected devices. I can still recommend the 6s 100%.	1
I also had reservations about iPhone, but I let myself be convinced and do not regret my decision. I'm convinced by the software, in this case iOS9. The nice thing is, it is also useful after years, because Android can not compete. As for the talk about the battery performance, I have my concerns over the test magazines, I think they are sponsored. Mine lasts long enough, 4 days !!! and who is on the phone 24 hours? Less capacity means no shorter runtime, the hardware on the iPhone needs less power.	1
I can only say one thing about this smartphone. It's been great for over a year and I'm very satisfied. I've stood a lot and is really fast and 100% worth its price. When the iPhone 7 was introduced, I was really disappointed and am with mine 6s remained with 64gb and regret so far nothing Fingerscan is afloat and the function that turns up the screen is really great. The function that opens when strong press NEN other menu I have not needed until dimming to the flashlight	1
Everything great. Thank you, everything was fine. Since it was a gift, the joy was very great. Without hesitation to recommend further.	1
Perfect delivery, great device. The delivery was for the 19.10. announced. This took place already on 17.10. at 9 pm by GLS. I immediately put the iPhone into operation. Since I have all the devices from Apple, all my data, addresses and images were automatically exceeded. I am highly satisfied with the handling by Schreiner-Elektronik.	1
So far, I only had Android phones to about 300 euros. Now that my last cellphone had the first technical defects after only 1 1/2 years, I decided to try it with an Apple iPhone. So far I am very satisfied with it. The qualitative differences are clear. Better camera, better sound quality, faster smooth running. The battery life with 2 days is sufficient for me. The design / color in rose gold is great and it fits comfortably in the hand. 64GB of memory are enough for my music, pictures and documentaries. out. Switching from Android to iOS was not difficult and I was able to take my music from GoogleMusik with me comfortably. All apps that I had on my Android phone, work here synonymous error-free. E-mails / messages are picked up as automatically as before. Sure, the price is quite high, but this speaks for the quality and hopefully long life and service life for the phone. Maybe for comparison: you can reach a destination with a small car, mid-range car or luxury class car, the only question is what comfort you would like. They all do driving :-)	1
Top smartphone - even in 2019. Since I find it exaggerated to always have the latest and with an 800 ¬ upwards smartphone around, I have opted for the 6s. By means of power-saving mode, the battery lasts almost 2 days depending on usage and you do not have to do without anything. I would buy it again.	1
I ordered the iPhone for my friend for Christmas. I was really worried because it was not delivered directly from Amazon that a fake product arrives. Fortunately it did not come true. The delivery was fast and the product was original and sealed :)	1
Fantastic mobile device, ideal for playing, you can also make wonderful phone calls. Camera in normal lighting conditions. Manual you have to search, but it is there!	1
I got this phone for my birthday and I'm positively surprised. I have to say at this point that I previously had a Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini and it is my first iPhone. It offers plenty of storage space, has a large display and is also easy to use in one-handed mode If you need a nice, not too big and easy to use smartphone, the iPhone 6s is a very good choice.	1
Apple always has advanced technology. Live photos alla harry potter have something, yes clearly the phone costs more than the iPhone 6 - but this little thing alone has convinced me. that's what I call lasting memories. The photo and video quality is just amazing and even photos in the dark are very good. and from the optics alone. An extremely slim and lightweight mobile phone. AND NOW that which first made me doubt on the phone - the size. I thought it was unwieldy and therefore harder to use. I was wrong. Recently had my old mobile phone in hand and had to determine how small that actually is - hot service top and you get used to it quickly. Samsung's phones and others often freeze my screen - not here. never . Apple is an example of what also shows optically in Samsung phones. and technically always first. So I have indulged, yes it is easy expensive but I have not looked back and I am convinced that they would not. yolo (sorry i know that the word is embarrassing and out but still it's a good feeling to treat yourself to the best and most expensive cellphone (finally - always had middle class phones before))	1
It came on in two days. Everything was fine on the phone. I am very impressed. And I think the price is cheap.	1
Am Vollsten to peace with the article does and does what it is to do am still looking forward to the iPhone 7	1
I'm very happy with the iPhome. Size optimal and easy to use. Also the color white / gold is perfect. Looks elegant.	1
I bought the phone in November 2015, so far I am very satisfied, I will gladly recommend it!	1
I have never held such a great gerär in my hands. It is so beautifully processed and looks super high quality. The camera is also great when you take a picture then it is in the same moment as you already pressed off the so-called 3d toutch I'm still so used to incht but that is not so relewat at the moment.	1
What else do you want to write about an iPhone? Almost all of them have already been written. My choice for an iPhone was mainly because all communication in the family takes place with Apple devices	1
I was for the purchase of the much better camera than the 5S important. The other features are secondary and a mere gimmick.	1
Probably the hottest mobile phone on the market. Forget everything that Android as BS has total error. Ihone 6, 5 stars not only because of the superfast processor.	1
It works great, I just love it. I have nothing to complain about. I never want to give it up again. Really only recommendable	1
Absolutely excellent product! An experience from unpacking to any further use. The only thing that bothers me is the low battery life but I can live with it because the iPhone 6s is a really great product!	1
In itself, the iPhone 6s is a great smartphone, which I could recommend in every respect. For some time, however, it turns off sporadically when the battery is below 80 (eighty)%. It can then no longer turn on, since the battery is apparently completely empty. It must then be hung on the charging cable, only then the original state of charge is displayed directly again. Increasingly, the problem occurs in a cold environment. Thus, the phone in everyday life is unfortunately almost completely unusable because it works in any way reliably. The problem is well known to Apple, but only a small part of the devices are officially identified and recognized by Apple as problem devices. Unfortunately, a visit to the Genius Bar did not produce any results for me - everything was in perfect order, although my phone went out both on the way to the Apple Store and afterwards and could not be switched on again without connecting it to the charging cable. I really hope that Apple still acts, and also repaired the remaining affected devices. It is in my view an impossibility that a € 800 mobile phone is useless after almost a year. If that really represents the politics of apples, this is probably my first and last iPhone, unfortunately. UPDATE: In a return visit to the Apple Store, the device was replaced immediately and free of charge. Thus, everything is fine with the phone again.	1
everything went great. There is not much to say about the iphone. The color rose gold makes the heart of the ladies beat faster.	1
Always go, just go, without much "" manual "". Everything just as with the 4s. Not much has changed, except ...	1
Have all iphones participated from 3g to 6s with the exception of the normal 5s and the normal 6ers. Was very satisfied with the 5s, since I own the 6s, I would not miss it. It is again a significant increase in performance felt when opening of apps etc. Also, I find the camera personally outstanding, so the actual quality. 4K, 12 MP, slomo with 240fps at 720p does not have to mean much, but it does in the case of the iphones! 3D Touch is a nice gimmick, but until now not really often meaningful angegesetzt.Könnte still live photos, etc. report But I do not. I'm very happy with the 6s.	1
This is my third iPhone and the first one that I am completely satisfied with, why is that? Because, in addition to the many known advantages, it is the first iPhone with enough memory (128 GB) to store photos, videos and music larger scale. Finally, no outsourcing needed. That's worth the extra charge compared to the 64 GB version. The reception problems criticized by another reviewer I could not nachvolziehen until today. All in all contrary to my iPhone 5s, the reception and the voice quality has become noticeably better.	1
Mui bien! A great smarthome that leaves nothing to be desired. Live-Picture function is great. Camera and display also. Apple as its best.	1
I'm very peacefully! The seller wrote the iPhone have slight signs of wear but that was not the case. The iPhone is like new without any defects, for a great price!	1
Am very satisfied, really a great smartphone !!! The phone still works great just super battery does not scratch I can only recommend!	1
My opinion, 6S is the optimal device! I say that from my own experience: S2, S3, S4, S6, S7 (Samsung) super mobile phone, But ultimately, you have a safe "" tool "", and decision is made alone	1
I bought the iPhone 6 S with 16 GB (not on Amazon) almost 14 days ago and am really satisfied. It's my first iPhone and I had thought about adding the 64 GB version before, but I use at most 10 apps, save my pictures and videos always the same on the PC and music I've never heard of my smartphone. I used to have Android and Windows Phone and now I just wanted to give IOS a chance. Compared with the other two systems I noticed.Pro:- much faster "" way of working "" just when opening apps or surfing the Internet- better camera and ingenious display- it is wonderful in the hand and the controls are well arranged- Switch to mute, I think super- large selection of apps (Android is synonymous ok, in Windows Phone, we better not talk about it) - simple and simple in the menu-Tonally, I could actually find no difference, because I put no value on it - better quality accessories => the headset is much better! Conclusion: - the battery needs to be charged more often (Android lasts one day longer, Windows Phone lasts a week longer !! with the same usage) - no removable battery (Windows Phone has this too not) - no SpeichererweiterungDas are as I said no reviews that let me classify the device as less valuable, it is only points that compared to me up fall. The iPhone is my definite favorite because it can do what it needs for me. I will not give it anymore and my next smartphone will definitely be an iPhone again :)	1
it is bigger as the 4s because I'm getting used to it and I have NEN protective silicone bumper will buy me NEN IP68 housing	1
Have the iPhone 6s 64GB White Silver for 2 weeks! And I am enthusiastic! Already had an S7 Edge! And what should I say! The iPhone 6s feels faster than the S7 Edge! And the battery life is no worse than the S7 Edge! The best smartphone I've ever had! But that's my opinion!!! Never again something else !!	1
Hello, Foreword: Once I was Applefeindin, until I came to the glorious idea to convert the Samsung S5 to Cyanogenmod 12. (big mistake), constantly this did not work and that not. In short: I wanted to use the hate product of the Android user itself. With great expectation it came and it has been packed pretty high quality. (which one expects of a € 849 expensive device!) The first few hours I was a little awkward, you can tell already on the start screen. The habit of wiping me up each time (usual due to the Samsung S5 usage), but once you register your finger and use it for unlocking, it's even a lot easier than with the Samsung S5 (often even disengaged as it is never wanted to work properly). The 3D feature has now been useful to me only in the email preview. I still play with it and explore the features that the iPhone offers me so. Even transferring the data from Android to iOS was extremely easy, thanks to the Android app, which unfortunately is rated by the Androidhatern more than bad. So I'm wondering what's going on with people? Others buy sinfully expensive Nike shoes and are not immediately pelted with Deichmann shoes. After the second day of use, I'm desperately happy. It does not jerk, it just does what I expect from the device! Instagram makes me even more fun, even if the camera has less megapixels than my Samsung S5. Who cares? This is more than correct for posting and distributing photos and videos. To "" photograph "", I use my Nikon 5300.Everything in one, I do not regret the purchase. The saving was worth it and I get a super device for my own small needs:) Hope it helped	1
What should you write long detailed reviews. Most of it has already been said. Since 2010 I always own an Iphone. Have in between the Firephone, for example. tested, Samsung and Huawei. In the end, I always landed at Apple ^ ^. It is simply the best match with the operating system. You pay a lot, that's true, but in principle for that reason. Time from Sciht of a non-experts, I summarize the things that I noticed in comparison to its predecessors positive (there is nothing negative). The Battery: Yes, it is really the battery talk. Correctly read. He was badly rated in tests, also justified. The problem is that 60 percent of users NEVER use the iphone at the level of the test. There it ran with some only 4 hours with full screen brightness and 4 hours of videos. Logically, after 4 hours Sense! The average user like me, writes, chats, reads on the Internet, looks at the train app, has vlt. a candy crush game or something like that: D. And surprisingly, I come with it, compared to its predecessors, one day until evening :) Unbelievable, but true. The screen: Yes, I think 4.7 inches are optimal. Not too big, not too small. The resolution is accordingly nicely matched to the screen and razor-sharp. Newer devices are already aimed at quad hd, but our eye can actually distinguish it from a certain strength, hardly more. So does not have to be quad hd:) The Cam: Yes the camera, since I was always fascinated by. She got even better and even sharper. At the front with 5 mp and at the back with 12. Still for me the best camera for the most beautiful photos, but this time the quality of my skin is already gone. The Akualität: As in the near future more and more 4k will be asked, one can say that This device will be up to date even in 3-4 years. Photos as well as videos eg. can be shot and shot here in 4k (barely applicable but up to date). It is quite future-proof and with the price invested one still better tick, than in the iphone 6. ^^	1
After the charging socket of my iPhone 6 had the service acknowledged, I got as a replacement device brand new iPhones 6s received. But unfortunately in the color rosé gold, which has run rather stupid for me as a man ... Battery: Lasts felt minimal shorter than its predecessor. According to the data sheet, the battery should also have shrunk, but in everyday life is not really felt. The battery will definitely last longer than a day. With economical use even two. Display: The display is like the iPhone 6 used the madness. Razor sharp, and easy to use. It is more than sufficiently bright. Once used to 3D Touch, it is almost impossible to think away from everyday life. Reception: Always good and everywhere LTE. Also in the WLAN, there is nothing to beansanden.Gehäuse: Except for the color .... the same case, like the iPhone 6. It is (who would have thought) as well in the hand as the iPhone 6 and is comfortable for me Cameras: Both the front and the main camera are significantly better than those of the iPhone 6. And the iPhone 6 was already top more there is not to say.iOS: An innovation is that "" Hey Siri! "" Now also works, if one does not have the iPhone on the charging cable. Otherwise the already mentioned 3D Touch is a new feature. Conclusion: The iPhone 6s is a really good smartphone. It is much better than the iPhone 6, which I did not think before. 3D Touch is like I think a very useful extension and (still) a unique feature. Because of the color, I'll probably have to order a skin slide. But I can cope and forgive full 5 stars.	1
I switched from Android to the Iphone 6s or ios and I have to say I have not regretted this step in any way. The iphone 6s has a very classy aluminum unibody housing which looks very good in my view. The antenna strips do not bother me at all, I even refer to them as beautiful. the iphone is also very good in the hand. To the display, I have to say that at the beginning, when I heard that the Iphone was not disappointed with a full hd resolution, that really does not falter at all unless you really look closely at the display .... The operating system is on Ios 9 and as a former Android user I have to say that ios is already better .... It just looks extremely plain and not too colorful ..... Although many people have complained about the battery I can give it a touch you can easily through the day and if you have to recharge the battery overnight it does not itch because you anyway sleeps ... The camera is the best smartphone camera I've ever seen ... Pictures are sharp Sharp and really see always very good .... I can really recommend the iphone to anyone .. Only from the 16gb variant I can advise against because the camera really absorbs the memory but the 64gb version is never empty.	1
I've bought every generation of iPhone since the iPhone 3GS (costing around $ 150 a year if you buy / sell it at the right time). The advantages of an iPhone (very reliable, simple operation, extremely good workmanship, great synchronization with OS X) I would not like to mention here again, for the reason most people know this already and I have them in the reviews on the previous iPhone models already I would like to discuss here briefly, whether the conversion of a still very good iPhone 6 on an iPhone 6s is worthwhile and the not so obvious difference herausstellen.1. QualityIn this I was not satisfied with the iPhone 6. It somehow felt "cheap", condemned, was not stiff, everywhere it gave way. Switching directly to an iPhone 6s, you realize that it is much more stable. You do not see that it is a little thicker, but it feels it immediately (I think). It does not creak any more, moreover it is a bit heavier. I like, it finally feels as solid as the other iPhones.2. New featuresHere I can only call 3D touch as the only one. All others (faster Wi-Fi, etc.) I consider negligible, because it was already hoppladihopp on the iPhone 6. 3D Touch is a feature which, typical for Apple, is already deeply integrated into the system. You quickly get used to the resulting shortcuts, it works perfectly well. I can not think about many well-thought-out features anymore (for example, the keyboard turns into a "touchpad" at fixed pressure, which can move the cursor as you type) .3. Speed ​​Can not really say that it has changed. Whether the apps start 0.1s faster, is not really relevant for me in everyday life. More RAMEtwas, which is really helpful! The open apps are now partially in the cache for days and are immediately available when called. This clearly differentiates the 6s from the 6 and is also really useful.5. AkkuI think it's not so nice that the battery is smaller, but I have not really noticed any of it. The duration between the charges is still outstanding - you do not need any trickery or eternal system maintenance. I've made "Backgrund App Refresh" for everything but Whatsapp (no other app really needs it), which adds another few hours. In moderate use, the iPhone easily through 2 days durch.Nach as ugly: The only criticisms remain for this iPhone. That the camera stands out, is very annoying. Constantly tilts the device. Similarly, the plastic antennas are a design flaw. Personally, even more RAM (3 or 4 GB, why not ?!) would not be bad at all. But that's no reason not to buy it. Conclusion: Yes, I think it's worth switching to the 6s. The better quality, 3D touch and especially the RAM are things that you appreciate in everyday use!	1
Hi, I have after the S4 / S6 iPhone 6S in 64 GB increased and thus leave the Android OS for the time being. The iPhone I did not buy at Amazon (1019 ¬) but at Media Markt (849 ¬). Impression after a Week iPhone 6S use. The iPhone feels like a one-stop shop. Great look, great processing. The battery holds and holds. Even if the battery has become smaller, it lasts longer than most Android with the thick Akkus.Morgens at 8 o'clock at 100%, with some phone calls, check e-mail more often, online banking I'm at 18 o'clock at 73%. Standby time is terrific like the macbooks. Barely loses% over the night. Runs very smoothly, fingerprint very fast, high data security (rights of the apps can be easily limited). More impressions after 2 weeks The battery continues to keep excellent by s.o. even with Powerusing I am at over 60% on a working day of 10h. Constant phone calls, use notes, send e-mail, Internet research, news apps. The synchronization is of course made great no matter where I write what (notes / calendar) Mac or iCloud it lands on the iPhone and vice versa. The camera is also great. Pictures are similar to the S6 Edge pictures. Here, the ghosts divide between camera Phanatikern.Force Touch is nice but I personally use little. The display is crisp and very bright and very pleasant colors. The OS is of course strongly based on OSX and MacUser should find themselves very quickly cope anyway .Siri has been developed significantly and now understands very well. Dates, alarms, reminders, photos, phone calls, navigations are no problem for Siri. Even something like "" Siri I have a cold or I'm sick "" Siri understands and suggests doctors in your area. Great thing.Clear purchase recommendation.	1
I used the iphone 4s for 4-5 years and then opted for the 6s as it was cheaper than the 7 and in my opinion not much worse. The first few days were a bit strange due to the size but you get used to it quickly. What bothered me a lot is that it has slipped so often out of my hand. I then bought a silicone sleeve. That helped, but of course it does not look that great anymore. If you own an iphone 6 or 6 plus and are considering buying a new one, I can only say, "it's not worth it". Spending so much money for not much more power is blatant in my eyes. An upgrade is in my opinion until the 5s and down to consider. Who says anyway, "" hey I need a new phone "" I can only recommend the 6s. Except for the mentioned smooth surface, I have nothing on the device suspend.I hope I could help a bit.	1
I bought an iPhone 6s at the end of November. The delivery came after three days, super fast and packed very well. That was great. The phone is great. The battery is running and running. I have read the reviews on the supplier first, they were all great and can only confirm.	1
There are 5 stars for the delivery because it came a week earlier than actually stated. The iphone 6s has not had a better smartphone yet.	1
I can not hear it anymore! The processor is too slow or the thing has only 2GB of RAM! iOS does not need 6GB RAM or an Octacore! And the build quality that some criticize - since you're sure that you have a real iPhone 6s and not just a cheap fake from China? Have all the equipment here! LG G5, Galaxy S7, Huawei P9 and HTC 10. The iPhone beats them and Android affects me even in the version 7.0 unfinished and still in the beta stage! Top SmartphoneTop processing Top PerformanceMy Galaxy S7, however, is real Chinaware!	1
I have the new Iphone 6s in connection with my contract renewal at Vodafone on 25.9. purchased. My model is the 64 Gb variant. There is still a 16 Gb variant and a 128 Gb variant for sale. Previously I had an Iphone 6 and before that an Android from Samsung. I ordered the phone because I was satisfied with my Iphone 6 except for the battery and I could choose a new phone on my contract. In the following lines I try as well as possible to respond to the phone. I will update my recession again and again if there is something new. I also like to answer any questions or try to answer them. ### Optics and Haptics ### At first glance, the new Apple flagship looks very similar to the Iphone 6. The Iphone 6s is made of a new aluminum alloy, a 7000 Al alloy. This alloy makes the iPhone harder and much warmer than the iPhone 6. You just learn from mistakes and gearing up against a new Bendgate as was the case with the Iphone 6 and the Sony Z3. Compared to its predecessor, the smartphone is marginally heavier (14g) and now weighs 143g. Personally, I did not notice the weight difference. In addition, the 6s has become due to the new touch screen synonymous 0.2 mm thick, but I do not feel as bad. The previous colors Space Gray, Silver and Gold are now accompanied by rose gold as a further variant. ### Display ### The 4.7 inch display of the iPhone 6 will continue to be used. It dissolves with 1334x750 pixels, which corresponds to a still very good pixel density of 326 ppi. Hand on heart dear friends, 326 ppi are more than adequate. What Sony or LG throw their new phones in terms of pixel density on the market is spun. You can confidently say that there are no single pixels to see. Apart from the 3D Touch, the display of the Iphone 6s is unchanged compared to the predecessor. But exactly this 3D touch technology upgrades the display neatly. Thanks to the various pressure points, you can save a lot of time using the smartphone when you are used to the operation, but this is quite fast. ### Processor ### The new Iphone 6s works with a new A9 64- Bit SoC processor. According to Apple, the chip should bring a plus of 70% in CPU and a plus of 90% in GPU performance compared to the A8 chip. The A9 processor brings in Geekbench 3 a record around the 2500 points, my Iphone 6 creates compared to the 1600 points. The Z3 of my sister comes only to about 1300 points. The processor of the new flagship is extremely fast, much faster than the fastest Qualcomm processor of the Snapdragon 810. Thus, the new processor is undoubtedly the reference in the field of mobile processors. Hand on the heart dear friends more computing power is currently not available even with the android competition. The device runs without jerks with a top performance. Here you can see that the software is perfectly matched to the hardware. ### Camera ### Less convinced me the new camera. Although the number of megapixels has been increased from 8 to 12 megapixels, the images are not noticeably better, if only marginally. This does not mean that the camera shoots bad pictures.Only the improvement from the Iphone 6 to the 6s is low. Nevertheless, it must be said that the Z3 from Sony, the S6 from Samsung or even the G4 from LG makes better pictures in almost every situation. I do not just want to complain, the front camera has been raised from 1.2 megapixels to 5 megapixels. This innovation leads to noticeably sharper, more detailed images with less image noise. New compared to its predecessor is the 4K video recording, which undoubtedly delivers videos in top quality. However, some Android cars have been able to do this for quite some time. So it was time for Apple to follow suit. However, it should be noted that videos with this resolution generate a lot of data and you have completely filled the 16 Gb memory of the smallest version within a few minutes. We are talking about 350 megabytes of footage per minute. Definitely worth the 64 Gb version or even the 128 Gb version for the people who want to use this feature extensively and more often. Unfortunately, the camera also looks slightly out of the case at the 6s. ### Battery ### The built-in battery is a 1715 mAh battery, which admittedly a bit disappointed. Even the battery of Iphone 6 was already about 100 mAh larger, compared to the android competition, the battery appears very small. The runtime is not very high, the phone does not last more than a day, with frequent use of the battery is already premature to neige.Update 29.9.15To voice quality, I can not report anything negative. When calling in the D2 network no background noise occurs I had no disconnections. The sound of the speakers is also good, and I find that the Sony Z3 and the HTC smartphones offer better speakers and sound quality. However, this is complain at a high level Update 1.10.15The battery is now a bit more persistent than initially assumed. He still can not get to a 3000 mah battery of the Android competition, but the available capacity is very well exploited. 1 day runtime does not seem to be a problem, but in the evening the mobile phone has to be charged. ### Conclusion ### Compared to the predecessor of the iPhone 6, the 6s are more technical, the design remains almost unchanged. But that does not bother, since the Iphone 6 was already a real eye-catcher. The processor is a bit faster and is now the reference class in the field of mobile processors. I like the 3D touch technology very well and definitely offers added value. The Iphone 6s is a successful smartphone. A switch from the Iphone 6 to the 6s is not worth it in my opinion. The added power of the processor and the rest of the innovations are not to be despised, but do not justify a new acquisition. But if you have an older IOS device or an older Android, it's definitely worth buying. Here you do not do anything wrong. Only the weak battery and the camera spoil the very positive picture a little bit. You could have expected more here. I would give 4.5 stars, but since this is not possible I give 5 stars. If you have any questions about the product, you can ask me in the comments, I will then try to answer in a timely manner.	1
This is my next iPhone now ... I have had every iPhone 3G. In the meantime, I also had the Samsung Note 3 and the Sony Xperia Z1 & Z2. Although many here are referred to as "" Apple Fanboy "" because they write good reviews I am DEFINITIVE None! Now, however, to the Apple iPhone 6S 64GB Gold It has not changed ... it still looks just like last year, so that iPhone 6. It has become a good deal heavier, since it is now built from the so-called 7000 aluminum. I think it's not annoying on the contrary you now have the feeling of something high-quality to hold in your hand but that is a matter of taste. Incidentally, there are now 4 colors to choose from, I personally think the golden model is the most beautiful. Real ne eye candy. Software & Performance: The software I think you do not need much to say because someone considering an iPhone to buy knows that it runs on iOS ... and here everyone can say what he wants it is and runs MUCH BETTER than Android in terms of performance, Samsung and Co. can use 16 GB of RAM that does not change anything, even if I hear full HD display, quad-core CPU, etc. What does that bring somebody if everything really everything on iPhone faster, more fluid and easier runs?! One can select now how one wants to take videos eg. Full HD with 30 or 60 or 4K. I record everything in FullHd at 60 and the quality is really awesome !!! Also, the display is extremely sharp ... I wonder how that can be although it is not even FullHD?! People who only look at data and therefore immediately say iphone's scrap (99% of Android users) does me a favor and go to MediaMarkt or Saturn and make yourself a picture of. I bet you'll think how can this be, it's not even FullHD but it looks better than on my smartphone. Even selfies become super good thanks to the 5MP front camera! Or the start of apps ... because you can feel the 2GB RAM ... everything is super fast incredibly. Force Touch is also a win that is guaranteed to be enforced on some apps and are already there eg Instagram, Facebook or Whatsapp.Man has almost everywhere a "" preview mode "" or quick functions. When I think back to my Android smartphones, I can say quite frankly ... I will never switch back because that's worlds for me in terms of performance and operation. It is also not without reason that eg the Samsung S5, S6 (also Edge) flopped ... Sony writes are beginning of the smartphones throughout red numbers. It is changing more and more to iOS, especially in 2015, it was more than ever before (can google is the truth). Clearly, the price is a deterrent but in a course you get usually always good money. Look at what a 5S still costs today ... unfassbar.Ich can definitely recommend the smartphone only weiter.Punkte: - 16GB version is an impudence - Water & dust protected would be great feature - Slightly changed design would be cool	1
Compared to the 6er a typical s update. 3D Touch is a very handy thing, really good if most apps support it. The camera is again a bit closer to the very good. And that I mean as a user of a Fuji xt1.Fingerprint scanner is perfect.And the speed increase really clear. There is the advantage that Apple developed the processor itself, from the outside comes only the ARM basic design and manufacturing capacity. Speed ​​is also on the new Nand controller. It is now water protected without Apple making a Brouhei drum. Yes, but guaranteed with timely security updates and major system updates. Together with the unique feature Privacy for me the killer argument for iPhones. If Android then Nexus. Yesterday, but I read a guide to the OTA update for marshmallow, first I thought that satire is so complicated is ... the same applies to backup solutions.	1
I'll make it short: Tests confirm a great camera, the battery keeps in moderate use including several hours of music streaming a good two days, the device is extremely lightweight, extremely robust and in terms of processing the absolute premium class. I think discussions ala "" Android there is the same performance for the fraction of the price "" or "" Apple wants to cup only "" or "" The software narrows that I do not pay with "" does not help anything. Either one can relate to the philosophy Either you accept the closed and thus secure system, or not. Either you accept a premium price for premium quality, or not. I know what I have to Apple, have found in Android no equivalent device, whose manufacturer I would feel comfortable because of the product support and have paid the price of just under 900 €. And I think the phone, including the Apple software universe, is worth it.	1
I have this iPhone unlike most reviewers actually, now for 2 days. A contract extension was due, my 5S is now my wife (with the way, I was very satisfied). Well then the 6S. Apple typical just the existing update on it, done. Since all (!) Android phones can cut off a thick slice of. How easy and round this is. That was also the reason why I finally stayed with the iPhone after many attempts with various androids. Of course, not everything is perfect here. Still, the whole package is just right, even if it's expensive. But even Samsung now demands horrendous Preise.Im comparison to the 5S first falls on the size, but to which one gets used within a very short time. For me now ideal, big enough to surf the Internet and look nice photos, small enough to be reasonably operable. The 6S is incredibly fast, not only as far as the fingerprint sensor is concerned, but also when loading websites etc. 3D Touch is a nice gimmick, but it's still under implemented in iOS and third-party apps. That will come, it works great already. Battery is enough for the 6S well over a day, even with intensive use. Photo quality is not so important for me now, I think, since most "" Premium "" - Handys today not much. Overall, I am so very satisfied again, the only criticism that I have concerns the reception quality. Here I have the feeling that in comparison to the 5S has deteriorated, sometimes I can not understand interlocutors, at LTE in the telecom network in the middle of the city actually an absurdity. But that can change, update would be submitted later. All in all 4.5 stars, because today is Monday, I round generously. Update 19.10 .: Meanwhile, there were no more crashes, reception is 1A, the thing is running bombastic. In the evening I still have nearly 40% battery (minimum) and completely satisfied.	1
The iPhone 6S is the evolution of the iPhone 6. In comparison, it adds some weight. In addition, Apple has added at the camera resolution and the pace. Apple collects plus points with the handy and slim design, with a high working speed and its very sharp 3D touch display. Negatives on the other hand by the permanently installed battery, a non-existent memory card slot and optical image stabilizer.	1
Super deviceLiquid, stable battery, secure operating system, optically great. Do not understand these bad reviews. Price is a bit high but if you want quality, then you should pay for it. Advantage price is not as strong as on Android devices.	1
This is my third Iphone, and I can only say that I like this model so far the best. Had before the 4s, 5s, and now the 6s.Form, display (especially the size) speed, battery, design, everything better again Nice and faster than the predecessor. Can this händy recommend to anyone. The price is salted, but worth every euro, have my 5s sold for € 315 in the bay, so only a small extra charge for the new.	1
Hi, I have after the S4 / S6 iPhone 6S in 64 GB increased and thus leave the Android OS for the time being. The iPhone I did not buy at Amazon (1019 ¬) but at Media Markt (849 ¬). Impression after a Week iPhone 6S use. The iPhone feels like a one-stop shop. Great look, great processing. The battery holds and holds. Even if the battery has become smaller, it lasts longer than most Android with the thick Akkus.Morgens at 8 o'clock at 100%, with some phone calls, check e-mail more often, online banking I'm at 18 o'clock at 73%. Standby time is terrific like the macbooks. Barely loses% over the night. Runs very smoothly, fingerprint very fast, high data security (rights of the apps can be easily limited). More impressions after 2 weeks The battery continues to keep excellent by s.o. even with Powerusing I am at over 60% on a working day of 10h. Constant phone calls, use notes, send e-mail, Internet research, news apps. The synchronization is of course made great no matter where I write what (notes / calendar) Mac or iCloud it lands on the iPhone and vice versa. The camera is also great. Pictures are similar to the S6 Edge pictures. Here, the ghosts divide between camera Phanatikern.Force Touch is nice but I personally use little. The display is crisp and very bright and very pleasant colors. The OS is of course strongly based on OSX and MacUser should find themselves very quickly cope anyway .Siri has been developed significantly and now understands very well. Dates, alarms, reminders, photos, phone calls, navigations are no problem for Siri. Even something like "" Siri I have a cold or I'm sick "" Siri understands and suggests doctors in your area. Super thing.Klare Kaufempfehlung.Long again Android fanatics claim the iPhone 6S is technically not up to par. The Geekbench tests prove just the opposite. In the area of ​​performance, all current smartphones are facing the rear of the iPhone. It does not need any, yes, but I have an 8 core processor to come.	1
First of all: I do not go into comparisons with Android devices or the technical specifications, as you can read this elsewhere or my knowledge is rather limited. This can explain better to other users. For me, the principle of 'it just works' is more in the foreground. I played with the idea last year to buy an iPhone 6, but honestly was deterred by 'bendgate'. However, I liked the design very much, which is why I switched from the 5s to the 6s (64 GB version) (the 5s wanders on to my friend). The device was Apple typical (ordered directly from Apple) very fast since 'on 9.10. ordered, on 13.10. (yesterday) it was perfectly packed and delivered to the point. The packaging as always simple, but nothing is missing (cable + headphones as always there). The phone itself was configured in a few minutes, contacts / profiles etc. loaded and ready. I appreciate that at Apple, that the settings are easily adopted. The workmanship outside is top 'me personally, the easily protruding camera does not bother at all. Have the phone packed in a Fitbag case, with which I have the iPhone 5, 5s and an old HTC made very good experiences. The speed increase compared to the 5s is gigantic. The apps open without any delay, Touch ID works much faster when setting up than the 5s. The screen is very well lit and perfectly adequate for the average consumer. I use the phone for surfing, checking emails, whatsapps, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, various offline apps, Tripadvisor, to book hotels etc. 'So as a real small pocket computer, which allows me next to the IPad Air 2, that I the Computer at home hardly ever use. Force Touch is a nice feature, but it is supported by not too many apps. I also needed a few tries to get that done, because at first I did not know that you have to press firmly on the display before it works. In Mail, however, it is very handy, Preview / Quick functions like a "" New Mail "" are great. I have not tried Siri, but I usually use it very often.The dictation feature works well on IOS9 and has slightly improved again for IMO. I mainly use it to dictate longer mails at home on the couch on the tablet or on the phone. To the camera: This has improved significantly compared to the 5s version. I use a camera separately on holiday, but for very fine snapshots it is definitely enough. Very much improved over the 5s version is the front camera, which now does more than just acceptable pictures. Even the live pictures are a nice feature to play with when boring. In short, it's Apple, it just works. I can understand 100% when many say the phone is too expensive for what it offers. I just like the synchronization, but I would call myself very Apple-affine, since I had the iPhone 5 increased 'but also use Android (HTC company phone) and Windows privately. I work at home on a MacBook, working on an iMac, and I still own IPad Air 2 and now the 6s. Synchronization of all programs, emails, photos and Apple TV is easy and without a problem possible. My conclusion is therefore: Who like me and my girlfriend is already in the Apple universe, has the money left over and at least from the 5s changes, I can only recommend the 6s after a day of use. Otherwise, you are certainly just as well served with a high-end Android and the iPhone 6, because until Force Touch, the IMO is the main feature of the 6s, is going really well, it will probably take a while. Update (23.10.) : Unfortunately, my update of this week MO did not go through, so another attempt to recharge my battery. I was able to do some battery tests now. For me he keeps on 'normal' usage (WhatsApp, WIFI at work and at home, Bluetooth always off, Facebook, Safari, Twitter, Instagram, a few photos, a few documents and a few emails) really very long , Last week I managed 63 (!) Hours (16% rest battery) and 54 hours (24% rest battery). But I have to say that I close all applications at night and go into the power-saving mode, also the consumption is very much related to what else everything is enabled or disabled. For example, I have always disabled background updates and location services because they are eating too much battery. When power is used, I'm also well over the day, at the moment I'm just over 20 hours and still have 46% Akku.Vielleicht I have with my model just lucky or the difference to the 5s seems to me so gigantic (with the I've just come for a day use, often just over the day), but for my user behavior, the battery-added value is immense.Noch a tip to the live photos: If you do not need the feature rather disable, because the pictures but need a lot of space.	1
For me one of the best phones. Sophisticated software, great camera, best music and also the design is fine. The only drawback: it is not non-slip from the back. But use a Case.Has previously G3 / G4 / One M9 / Lumia 930 / 4s / 5sThe G4 had some better camera, but was not optimal in the usability. One M9 bad camera, Nokia not mature. Overall, the iPhone has the best components in one device and a solid and reliable software (sometimes slower than Android)	1
Review of the iPhone 6s Plus, space gray, 128 GB.First of all, I have accompanied the development of smartphones from the beginning, I am not a "fanboy" or otherwise "bought" or biased. After a few years in the Android warehouse with u.a. Devices from Sony, HTC and Samsung (I used the Note series for three years), I am now back on iOS. My last iPhone was the iPhone 4 - and since then a lot has happened, that much is already betrayed. As an iPad user, I am now used to the quality of the feel of Apple products, yet the first touch of the latest generation of devices was something special. It feels fantastic and looks just as good. Clearances, etc., one searches in vain. As a former note user, the size of the 6s Plus is also nothing special for me - in my opinion, it even feels a little thinner and narrower in the jeans pocket, even though the measurements are even a bit above the note level. Quickly the nano SIM inserted and brought the installation process behind it, immediately inspires the very bright and crisp display. ppi values ​​of over 800 (Hello Sony) are of course not achieved, but (of course) are no single pixel recognizable. The hammer is the speed increase of the Touch ID function. Pressing the home button without unlocking the display is almost impossible. Tip: Just take another finger. ;) Of course I miss the comparison to the pre-series, but also the camera excited. The videos look fantastic (60 fps is enough, 4K costs 375MB per minute movie!), The photos are crisp and almost DSLR quality. I'm looking forward to the first printouts. The speakers are beautiful, ohmic, loud, without reaching HTC quality, the included headphones are also of good quality. The new 3D touch feature immediately thrills and will, in my opinion, be in the next one The operating speed of the 6s Plus is otherwise awesome - here you can easily (!) Leave the Android competition with eight-core processors and 3 or 4 GB of RAM behind. Big praise to Apple, which once again show how the interaction of hardware and software can work. However, the most enthusiastic I am of a thing in which I was spoiled by the grade 1-4 - the battery life. Example today30, now at 14:00, the battery is still at an incredible 75%. And you know how hard you use new devices. Surfed, watched videos, made videos and photos and played with iMovie. Really the hammer - and maybe the reigns of CHIP, which criticize the battery life of the 6s so sharp, get a new test device. Something can not be right there ... A few criticisms I have also: - The detour via iTunes, "" just "" a couple of albums on the iPhone to push annoys even after years, especially iTunes iTunes pretty much the worst program World is unlocked the iPhone, I've observed several times that the screen freezes and you have to wait one or two seconds before you can do something. This review I will overhaul in the coming weeks every now and then to answer questions, To note down further observations or to describe problems. Conclusion: The iPhone 6s Plus is next to the M7 from HTC not only the most beautiful smartphone, which I have owned so far, but also the best. More than here you can hardly wait for a smartphone ...	1
I'm very happy with the iPhone 6s ... order on Amazon .... Top! And a very good dealer, where I bought the phone .. very good and recommendable!	1
I can agree with the previous speakers. Pro: speed, display, battery charging time with IPad power supply in 60min, AppStore, Bedien.Negativ I find now really only that one is bound to ITunes. Before that, I had the s6 Edge.	1
My new iPhone 6s still has 100% battery after 4 hours stand-by. It definitely lasts longer than my old IPhone 6. No idea what they tested, but I'm thrilled. There are recessions reporting the same thing. Is the migration from the iPhone 6 to the 6S worth it? In my opinion yes! The sensor of the home button is amazing. Just click and you are on the main page. The IPhone 6, it's really annoying. With this 3D touch, I can not do much (I thought). In safari left edge press a little harder and you can switch between your apps. The home button is becoming more and more superfluous, real madness. So I'm totally excited. In the AppStore many complain that new games like Fifa 16 and co. stutter. For me there is nothing jerking at all.Welcome to the new smartphone games era !!! Contra loss of value in the iPhone rather low.	1
A feast for the eyes! Apple stands for solid production & they also produce smsrtphones for a long life! :) The 6s is fast & well installed Camera top 4K no shake ... The s7 always the same shit ... After recording no matter which mode shaky recordings ... No matter what setting the camera recording sound bad ... speakers bad ... the iPhone everything perfect alone the speaker is a force! Crystal-clear sound in music:) Battery life settles after a good 6x load & holds! Bomb!	1
The wheel was certainly not reinvented with the 6s, who should expect that the purchase is superior. I am with 2 interruptions to Samsung and Microsoft Lumia are the iPhone 4 at Apple and am the most satisfied, the trip to Samsung and Lumia was interesting but in the end too much compromise. The iphone has its weaknesses like any other smartphone it has, but for me it's not an issue since i personally just think ios is a round thing with super apps (i found Lumia rather frightening, unfortunately it was me) Handy ansich geviel).	1
I have to admit, I was very skeptical about the iPhone 6S, but it really took my breath away. The workmanship is impeccable: - The display is bright, colorful, very rich in contrast and has a sharp white value. as well as the glass of the display is very hard, stable and the price very reasonable- The camera takes sharp photos ... and now the points that were very important to me and where I had my doubts. It said: The battery is weak and there is there still this thing with the processor ... The A9 is a sharp processor! It runs with 2GB of RAM and is a real machine! The interaction between IOS and the hardware is just perfect! The battery life is awesome! I am very pleasantly surprised at how economical the processor works and now comes the big hit: It was in many forums and websites, the Apple A9 at Samsung in 14nm and TSMC in 16nm make. The processor of TMSC (according to extreme tests on YouTube and co.), Although, according to paper, the Samsung should be more economical, be more economical and be cooler under load.It has been very annoyed to the next, what Apple has probably thought? I found out about a test app that is in my device the A9 from Samsung and I'm very satisfied with it. I can tell you, it's jacket like pants, which of the two chips is in your iPhone, even if some extreme tests are done and then they are released and cause some discussion again. I think that also has to do with the interaction with the software. Yes, maybe the TSMC is currently more economical by 2-3%, but the chip from Samsung is a big advancement and I think the tide will turn soon;) The whole device is just great and worth the money, of course. ..740 euros are already a lot of money and you get for less already a top smartphone, but everyone must decide for themselves. I think this device is currently the best in compactness, performance and workmanship that you can get on the market.	1
This hands-on video from mobiwatch.de introduces the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, compares them and captures the first impressions before the detailed test. For example, the new 3D Touch is shown, where the iPhone can differentiate between the normal, gentle tap on the touchscreen and a harder press, whereupon additional information is displayed. More infos, videos as well as the tests of the iPhones as always on mobiwatch.de. To play, just click on the adjacent video!	1
It will not take long and it is mercilessly badly reviewed again, although the 6s is a beautiful and sophisticated smartphone. I already read "" not waterproof "" "" Bends too fast "" "" Battery only lasts one day "" Bla bla bla .. That just annoys .. Every smartphone is in the evening all if you surf or play with it all day. And I can bend EVERY smartphone !! : D But I think I'm not moving from 6 to 6s, but the 7 next year is definitely coming into the house: DDAlso make it good out there and do not let it annoy, if the Hater set off here again;)	1
Everything appletypically wonderful! And even the smaller battery makes no problems. I have the i-Phone 6s now since release and the battery keeps without problems 2 complete days with medium use! Absolute buy recommendation :)	1
Will a relatively terse review.- battery could be better-but the best phone I've ever had- why I wanted to write the review eig ... Just this random image was created ... The picture speaks for the camera. hammer colors !!! Excellent! Am thrilled!	1
I have to say this iPhone 6s is the best there is. It's faster and more upscale than the other iPhones or phones, only iPhone SE does not know if it's faster - only the iPhone 6s is the best cell phone on the market right now	1
Attention! Extremely addictive! Let me always like to show the latest android of all kinds and then praise usually: Nice. Very nice. But so far I would not exchange any synonymous only for the Piel Frama iMagnum Case of my 6S (; -D) I would like to point out the perfect environment that is in no way inferior to the iPhone: Appstore, ICloud, ITunes Store - and basically also the legendary Apple Hotline with their now almost unheard of complete support. Conclusion after three years, four IPhones: perfection for lasting enjoyment.	1
I've always been a fan of Apple and this phone has not disappointed me! It works great as always and I'm reliable! Absolute buy recommendation!	1
Hello I want to buy this telephone but I have some questions.the telephone is new?it is EU-version?It haven't sim-lock?free?thank you very much!	1
There is nothing better for me than an iPhone ....... ..... ...... ...... ...... ........ ... .... ..... ....... ...... ......	1
I think the color is absolutely beautiful. I had the iPhone in rose gold together with a brush set by Luvia Luvia Cosmetics - Golden Queen Brush Set - 16 pcs. Cosmetic Brush Set - Including Make Up Brush Holder for storing the Vegan Makeup Brush Rossgold and a Michael Course Watch Michael Kors Ladies Wrist Watch XL Chronograph Quartz Stainless Steel MK5412bestellt. I like to keep it uniform and find myself the rose gold is absolutely noble. No matter what, cell phone, brush or clock. Everything is great in color. So now for the iPhone. What can I say, it is like the predecessor only faster. That you can press the display is initially funny, but then you do not want to without this function. If I use the phone of my husband, which does not have this feature, then that's funny.	1
cool part powerful and sexy find it super ipad pro is sure horny p.s am samsung hater but not so important	1
iPhone 6s has a super display and a mega good camera (5 megapixels !!!!!). The smartphone is blatantly just a pity that I can not afford it. [...]	1
As every year, the Apple community is waiting eagerly for the new iPhone and hopes for new features and features. After the presentation on 9 September is certain. Apple once again found a unique selling proposition and introduced it first. In this case, the 3D Touch. The detection of varying degrees of pressure on the touch screen. I am very curious how it will be in everyday life. It sounds very promising!	1
Actually it should be an iPhone XR. But after comparing 6s, 8s and XRs, I opted for base price performance for the 6s. Although the iPhone 6s has been on the market for more than three years, it runs almost as fast as its successors with IOS 12 and the camera makes very good and colorfast pictures. My 6s, which I bought here directly from Amazon, are an original packed and new device.	1
How not to expect otherwise: A great device with all around perfectly functioning technology and extremely high-quality workmanship. Too bad that Apple has stopped production of 64GB devices. A small upholstery would have been very nice to me. I do not need the device with 128 GB. Therefore, I was not ready to pay the considerable additional price. But that does not detract from the overall joy of the iPhone 6s.	1
Iphon was bought as "new", although I'm not really sure it's a completely new device. However, the phone is in perfect condition, originally delivered and with complete original accessories. Only battery capacity is at 84%, which indicates the age (or use?) Of the device. But by and large I am very satisfied, all features tested, everything works. Let's see how long :-)	1
Since I switched from a Galaxy, I had some "" conversion difficulties "" in the first days. "Meanwhile, it flutters and I get along very well with the operation. Since I am mostly only on the phone or take a lot of photos, send photos or videos, I am fully satisfied with the performance of this device. Furthermore, it fully complies with the description.	1
Fast delivery, super packed, 1a! Nice phone, easy to use. I am Apple Fan therefore full stars.	1
I bought this iPhone used by asgoodasnew and am completely satisfied. The condition was even better than described, there were no scratches or dents on the device. Also, the delivery was quite fast.	1
Hello bought and never thought with this price to good and beautiful HndyBesser there is not Thank you	1
I bought it for the replacement of a smartphone from another manufacturer, because in my circle of acquaintances all have an iPhone and everyone is very satisfied !!	1
I love my new iPhone. Easy to use, no fours, super quality.	1
I'm very happy with this phone so far. Looks like new and works fine. Could detect almost no signs of use.	1
Everything is great, I am very satisfied	1
All good	1
I ordered the device on August 31st and today it arrived. Apart from a few scratches on the display, the device has nothing at all. Always my pleasure	1
All good	1
I bought the iPhone 6s cheap as WareHouse Deal. Condition was as "" as new "" indicated - in fact came a completely schweises new device! Super Amazon! Price was regular 311 Euro - with primerabattaktion 20%, then only 248 Euro! You can not complain! Also included was a protective glass from Copter. Thank you very much! Good supplement. To the device itself: Have these as "" Upgrade "" of my iPhone 5s bought. Display is comfortable Large with 4.7 "" without being the same size as some other Android or Plus devices from Apple. Note: The iPhone 6s (as well as the 6s Plus) are the last iPhone with real blade connector; from the 7th you have to grab the adapter for the Lightninganschluss or Bluetooth headphones (I think personally not good). The color silver (with white front) I like visually very good. Sense supplement for the protection: - Case of Rhinoshield - especially the PlayProof protects all around; but also CrashGuard is TOP! The cases of Rhinoshield synonymous very well with protective glass or protective film. - Protective glass by Copter -> got said of Amazon for free and does its job very well!	1
Just great the iPhone !! I'm totally satisfied and excited. It would order again on Amazon because Amazon is very reliable!	1
Perfect product and fast delivery. One day later than scheduled and the product itself is needed, but not recognizable for me. It was absolutely worth it to order at ZOXS.	1
Still I am very satisfied, it has only 7 weeks handling just great photos good display is my first iPhone before Sony was also good this by far better	1
What can one say about an Iphone, it is a great device and I'm completely satisfied with it. Am an Apple lover and therefore I can only tell good about it. The shipping went smoothly. I keep recommending an Apple device, there is nothing better, I'm very happy with it. Thank you	1
Always had before only Android smartphones. I then decided to test an Apple product and am in retrospect very satisfied with the product. OS does not slow down like Android. faster access to every app.	1
Mobile phone was delivered quickly and is in top condition except for some barely visible hair scratches. The device works perfectly and it looks good. I am very pleased.	1
Except for 2 very small quirks, the device is in great condition. I would buy something from the seller at any time! Can send sellers with a clear conscience recommend.	1
Got a new IPhone 6s with 16gb ordered for a super priceBin very satisfied, came much earlier than stated16gb long me perfectly for this iPhone	1
What more do you want, 4.7 inches is still so one-handed use. And 3.5mm click connector. Listen to music on the plane without an adapter!	1
I'm a big fan of the Apple smartphones and I have my iPhone 6s now over 2 years and will certainly have at least another 2 years! In these 2 years, my smartphone has rarely had problems, and these were really not tragic. Once off and on and the problem was fixed again. (I take care of my phone very well, I can count it on both hands, how many times I've fallen down in the last 2 years, and mostly on a rug.) Furthermore, the speed of the software despite the high Age and iOS 11 still great. I never really have a problem that the smartphone hangs open briefly when opening an app. The only thing that I can fault is the battery performance. The capacity was not as good as other new smartphones from the start and its old age and the new software updates did not make it any better, but I usually get through pretty well most of the day, even though I have all sorts of social media apps and apps Use music apps during the bus ride. Sometimes I even get two days with a load! All in all, a really great phone, which really gave me a lot of pleasure, which is why I gave another copy of my mother's birthday and she's been blown away!	1
The iPhone 6s is an excellent smartphone. It is well known that the smartphone has a simple operating system and is very easy to use. In any case, I would recommend a case, because the phone on the back is very smooth and therefore can quickly slip off (out of hand, inclined surfaces). Also should Watch out for the camera as it protrudes a bit and can easily be scratched. I have been using the iPhone for a year now and am still fully satisfied.	1
Use it as a computer replacement. Although the camera is not really well built and partly contradicts the otherwise fantastic feel, I can recommend it to any of the iOS and Apple. Price performance is Apple rather weak. But considering that this is no longer a mobile phone in the true sense, it can somehow be reconciled with the conscience. So I just want to suggest that who only wants a phone here is definitely wrong!	1
Excellent goods at a very good price. There really is not really much to say. I am also thrilled with this, my 4th iPhone.	1
I had sworn to myself, no iPhone comes into the house after my last broken, but I have then opted for the iPhone 6s in rose gold. I must say, so far I have no problems with it (toitoitoi). Also the error with the battery - which haunts time and again through the media - I have not been able to determine.Top device!	1
iPhone halt.Da need not say much. Anyone who has arrived at Apple, which remains there. We are now talking to the whole family with Apple.	1
Fast and reliable delivery. To iPhone 6s itself, you do not have much to say, either you like it or not. Anyway, I'm fully satisfied, even the battery of the used mobile phone has a very good running time.	1
Very nice mobile. Before I bought on Amazon, I had to make three attempts at other dealers who could not deliver anything. The display is a reasonable size. 6s is equipped with a top camera.	1
Easy to use mobile phone. Large, clear display. Very good battery life. Despite its size, it is light in weight. Fast and correct shipping.	1
Previously had a Samsung Galaxy s4 that left me often because of system crashes in the lurch. That's why I dared change to Apple. I am very satisfied with the operation and the workmanship.	1
Ordered at A montain and it all worked out wonderfully. Fast shipping. To the device I can say that it is original packed and original! I am satisfied with the device. It arrived with iOS 9 and all the usual accessories	1
Seller is best, the seller has sent me wonderful iPhone in a very reasonable price. It's almost new.Thank you very much...	1
I am very pleased with the iPhone 6s. Before the iP I had a Galaxy S6 edge, in itself not a bad device. But you can not compare the processing with the Apple.Beim the iP, I immediately had the latest IOS version available, as you know it at Apple. In contrast to Samsung in conjunction with a telecom branding. Here you wait partly months until the new version is available. As long as then vulnerabilities are open, and every hack is happy. The battery of the iP holds in my use about half a day longer than the S6 edge. There are certainly more points who are better or worse. But that would go beyond the scope. It's usually a religious war. I stay with Apple, because there is still something worth the phone after half a year. Greetings	1
Everything is fine, compatible with other Mac's, condition rather like new, what more could you want. So far no quirks, hope it stays that way.	1
Like every year, I always have the newest iPhone. Whoever comes from the 6 Series will not notice a big change at first glance. For one thing, it was marginally heavier and thicker, on the other hand, the appearance has changed nothing compared to the previous year model. However, the 6s is much more future-proof. 2gb ram and 3d touch make the use of the device a dream. Back camera I can not see much difference compared to the 6er. The front camera, however, is high-resolution and equipped with a screen flash that is also really bright! Who has the 6 Series, should seriously consider whether the change is worthwhile. I would switch to a plus model.	1
I've now switched from my iPhone 4 because it was quite slow and no more updates and so much gives up the ghost :) and now I switched to the iPhone 6s and must say it is really very good. The switch was super easy, iPhone ran on Pc, data and programs from the old restored and everything was the same. Until now, the iPhone is running super / battery is empty every two days with normal use! But that's something. The best I like the proximity sensor and the 3D toucht.Sowie the Hammer Camera and natural highlight the 4K camera! iOS 10.0.2 runs great there is nothing to moan. Once iPhone always iPhone!	1
As you say, "if you do not have an iPhone, you do not have an iPhone." "Absolute Apple lover would buy it again and again	1
To make my review here really useful, I write from my special experience as a former iPhone 5s user who now uses the iPhone 6s. I go into the advantages that the 6s has compared to the 5s, or in which areas you can see no difference or why a change is worthwhile or not worthwhile.Old model: iPhone 5s, 16 GBNew model: iPhone 6s, 64 GB ** Screen size or mobile size ** The iPhone 6s has a noticeably larger screen. I was really satisfied with the size of the 5s and did not change for that reason. Frankly, the first two weeks I've gotten used to the larger screen, but now (about 1.5 months) I would not switch back. If I now have a 5s in the hand, it feels not only strange but too small. Although the size was not a change reason, I would now synonymous therefore to change. ** Touchscreen ** The iPhone 6s offers with the pressure-sensitive touch screen, a kind of right-click, in the additional options of certain apps are activated. Most standard apps already offer the option, of the other 50 apps I've installed, there are about 10 of this feature, with only about half really useful. I barely use that, so I do not see a change reason here. ** Speed ​​** I can make that short: The iPhone 5s was always super fast and I had no problems with it. Even after 2 years in continuous use, there was no reason to moan. There are no noticeable differences between 5s and 6s. ** Battery life ** Again, there is no difference. Due to the larger screen, I feel that I have to load the 6s a little more often. ** Camera or Photos / Videos ** I had hoped when switching from iPhone 5s to 6s, to get even sharper and more beautiful photos. And that hope was fulfilled. The photos at the 5s were great, now they are fantastic. An absolute reason to change, for those who want beautiful photos. Especially the front camera for selfies provides much better pictures. ** Memory ** I chose the 64 GB variant for the new iPhone 6s, because I was constantly struggling with memory problems with the 5s (16GB). I had to delete apps, photos or videos. That should not happen to me so fast now. ** CONCLUSION ** The change from iPhone 5s to iPhone 6s makes sense. Nicer photos, a better display and some new features that may be better used in the future (for example, I would be happy if the pressure-sensitive screen were used in games). If you change you should definitely go for the 64 GB version, also because the apps are getting bigger and the photos / videos need more memory due to the better quality. Thanks for reading and hopefully a lot of fun with the iPhone 6s.	1
After my iPhone 4s was stolen, I first switched to a samsung device and was super dissatisfied. After 2 years there was also his spirit. Finally an iphone again. The quality starts with the packaging. Super chic and noble. The included headphones have a wonderful sound quality and look very high quality. The device itself is good in the hand and I like the design her great. The size is perfect and you can manage well with one hand. Of the "" inner values ​​"" I do not have the biggest idea. The images are crisp, processes run off quickly, so far nothing has crashed, the thing with the 3d touch works flawlessly (samsung the largest mist), the touchscreen is very sensitive and the sound quality when talking is outstanding. In my opinion, then great phone. The price is of course very high, but quite honestly this device is pure quality.	1
First of all what I would like to get rid of very fast delivery was between 12 and 18 February but already on the 4th so top delivery. I write a review later on the device, because I am only this day in operation and test because of bad reviews. Mainly the alku is tested and compared with my 5s.	1
Although I was a bit skeptical at the beginning, because the device was 50, -EUR cheaper than the competition, I am very satisfied.Die delivery took 4 days, probably not directly from De, but it is an original product.	1
After 20 years, I switched to the Iphone 6s for the first time from Samsung (after the 1 year old Note 4 was broken). I'm thrilled. From the handling, the design and especially for the reason that the Iphone can be coupled with the Ipad and the Macbook easily. Basically, the combination of all Apple products and the resulting problem-free use is really great! Unfortunately, there are two shortcomings. The switch-off button is now defective after 6 weeks. But was picked up easily by Apple for repair. Went quickly and easily. At the Apple Hotline, I then learned that the device was not actually produced for Germany. Unfortunately, I do not know if this is a disadvantage: The Iphone was delivered in a wrong color. I ordered rose-gold and got it in gold. Was not a big topic for me, because I like both colors but should not be like that.	1
I am very happy. The iPhone arrived within two days. The packaging was great and the phone is working properly. And the price just incredible. So I would recommend to anyone to order it. Can not do anything wrong.	1
As always, I am inspired by Apple Quality and technology speak for you A clear purchase description Best smartphone ever a device with great	1
As a user of Android for many years, I can only praise the iPhone so far! In practice, the iPhone 6s proves to be a very good phone with an excellent display, strong camera (not very important to me personally), consistently high speed and well-known innovative user interface. In my opinion, the 3D-Touch has practical use and still has potential, the same applies to a few other functions that already look very promising with the upcoming iOS 10 update. The design of the smartphone is mMn. also very successful and for my taste higher quality than most Android devices. Full score so!	1
I'm excited! After I had bought another phone from another manufacturer, which I liked well, but with the "" Teething "" did not agree, I bought this device. Super fixed device, everything was problem-free a good decision: P	1
VorwaendFrom my personal perspective and usage requirements for such a smartphone, the review should offer those interested a small and hopefully helpful clue to the assessment. In the family we use privately and professionally devices from both the "" iOS / Apple World "" (here iPhone 5S, 6 and now 6s) - as well as from the "" Android world "" (Huawei P8, LG G4). I am not an advocate of a "faith struggle" "between the different" "worlds" ". From my point of view: both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. In the end, it's up to each one to decide which system suits better. In the review, I'd rather compare the iPhone 6s with the predecessors than with the models from the Android world. >>> For a better overview, a small table of contents: 1. First impression / form factor / haptics / processing. Neues.3. Operating System / Software Equipment / Scope of Delivery / UVP.4. Kritik.5. Fazit.1. First impression. With the iPhone 6s, Apple has been on a cycle since the release of the iPhone 3, following a major change in case design, followed by a year of consolidation, which is more about changing / improving internal values View, the iPhone has now reached the ideal size with the 4.7 inches. The 4 inches in the iPhone 5 and 5s with the felt very slim design are in comparison (have a 5s for comparison here) significantly kleiner.Eine one-hand operation (of course, depending on finger length and hand size) are still well possible. Should it ever be tight, there is a possibility here by double-tip on the touch ID sensor to move the display display down. This actually works very well. I must confess to use this feature not very often. The rounded and circumferential outer edge as well as the edge slightly rounded display ensure a (relatively) good grip of the device. It is handily good in the hand, but it is still very smooth. The display and the surrounding aluminum edge seem to merge into each other almost without a gap. The overall build quality makes a very good impression. the iPhone 6's nominally higher weight does not really stand out (143g versus 129g) and is mainly made up of an improved aluminum. The slightly thicker construction (7.1 mm versus 6.9 mm) to its predecessor is also not noticeable. The slightly thicker construction gives the device a bit more "stability" (keyword Bentgate). The slight but noticeable protruding camera lens bothers me a bit, because it bothers here the "" out of a cast "" - impression something. But it is designed accordingly so that you never get stuck.2. Neues.Ich would not bore the reader with mostly incomprehensible technical vocabulary, so only very briefly: in the interior was a new so-called A9 - a processor with approx. 1.8GHz clocking 3rd generation Cyclone built on 64 bit architecture. An improved graphics processor (Power GT7600), working with a 2 GB RAM (unlike the iPhone 6 for the first time), ensures smooth working and a perfect display of HD content and graphics-intensive games at all times with other providers from the "other world" once again a "" arms race "" concerning technical equipment, takes place. Apple remains moderate in this respect in the iPhone 6S and relies on evolutionary changes and ultimately on an optimized matching between hardware and software. The battery capacity was slightly reduced (1,715 mAh versus 1,809 mAh) and ensures a nominal comparably long running time.The standby time when not in use has remained identical to its predecessor. In addition to the installed acceleration, gyro sensor and compass, the new iPhone also has an air pressure sensor (barometric sensor). Conversions can thus also be used to determine altitude measurements. For various tracking, hiking and fitness apps, this is a real added benefit. The technical parameters of the front and rear camera have sometimes changed significantly. The back camera is now equipped with 12.2 MP (previously 8 MP); the front camera with 5 MP (previously 1.2 MP). Videos in the highest resolution can now be recorded in 4K at 30fps (previously 1080p) .3D TouchAn innovation I was very excited about and which works very well is the so-called "3D Touch". A pressure-sensitive touch surface now allows different display results. In addition to the well-known multi-touch gestures such as typing, closing and closing, four-finger strokes, etc., there are now different degrees of pressure (Apple calls it "peek and pop"). Very good, I think that the iPhone a triggered 3D touch gesture on a very gentle and subtle vibration or similar. approved. I am so that I rarely intensively and often use the new gesture but still often explore a lot, where there would be a possible use. One will probably only have to get used to the new possibilities. To the Telefonierverhalten I can only say so much that this point works well. Receiving, listening and voice quality, I can describe as very good. Operating system / software / delivery / UVP.Werkseitig of course, the new operating system iOS 9.1 preinstalled.The scope of supply includes, as with its predecessors, the headphones (EarPods with remote control and microphone), the Lightning to USB cable and the 5W USB Power Adapter.The MSRP price of the 64GB variant is 849 Euro (iPhone 6 799 Euro). There are the iPhone still in the memory versions 16 GB (739 euro) and 128 GB (RRP 959 euro) as well as in each case in the colors silver, gold, space gray and rose gold. Criticism Apple's strategy is and will continue to be to integrate and merge devices within the "ecosystem" (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, etc.) as much as possible. Outside the own ecosystem, the devices and software are sealed off. The reasons for this strategy may be very diverse: profit maximization, security reasons, the user experience only to the pure application. This can, depending on the user's claim, of course, but also have disadvantages. Some narrowed uses and restrictions Apple, I see critically (as an example: why is the Lightning SD card adapter only for the iPad and not for the iPhone). If you discover after buying an iPhone that you can not expand the devices via microSD storage or it is just not identified by a notebook as a hard drive, has previously simply not sufficiently informed. Sure, there are some ways to get around the restrictions. What I recommend: Potential users should try to get enough information about the pros and cons (regardless of the emotionally charged brand image of the opposing worlds). Starting with your own usage claim, you should take the devices once in your hands, test them and consider: - what your personal average usage might look like - what data, photos or music I would like to have on the device - how could the cooperation with my remaining technical Equipment look like, etc. From this everybody has a basis on which one can decide. Finally, the devices are not cheap. By the way, when you buy new equipment, think about the high resale value.5. ConclusionFrom my point of view, the iPhone 6s has a very good smartphone in a (compared to its predecessor) almost the same design. The iPhone 6s is designed for trouble-free use without much "adjustment". This is achieved through a coordinated symbiosis of hardware and software. Be aware of limitations in connectivity and expandability in advance. Starting from the use claims, the iPhone for many a perfect companion in everyday life sein.Ich hope the review was for the one or the other for the decision for or against something helpful.	1
Super transaction, the iPhone came fast and was exactly what I had ordered. Right thing at a good price  well protected in his parcel. I recommande this seller.	1
I like it very much but that's a matter of taste, everyone has to decide for themselves or not ok.	1
Am very satisfied with the new IPhone 6s, keeps what was promised. Works very well together with the iPad Air.	1
The iPhone 6s from Apple comes with a Lightning cable, user manuals and the white headphones securely packaged. What has changed between the 6 Series and the 6s model and how does the flagship of Apple compared to the competition? On September, the iPhone 6s with 16GB, 64GB and 128GB capacities will be sold and days later it has broken its previous sales figures. Something must make Apple right, because evil tongues claim that only "iDiots" "such overpriced devices kaufen.Das iPhone 6s has a much stronger case than the iPhone 6, so that they can not bend ;-) Apple is here on a hard aluminum-zinc alloy (7000er aluminum) instead of the former aluminum-magnesium alloy (6000 aluminum) - a renewed Bendgate scandal thus impossible. That and the 3D touch technology make the 6s a little heavier and thicker than its predecessor. By 0.1-0.2mm grows the case and weighs just under 15 grams more. Barely noticeable.Value, elegance and workmanship, I do not really have to start. In my opinion, the most beautiful smartphone on the market - seamless transitions from curved glass to the frame, scratch-resistant and noble aluminum back and great workmanship of all housing openings and switches. The resolution remains unchanged at 1334x750 pixels with a display size of 4.7 inches, which corresponds to 326ppi. Apple renounces consciously the UHD trend with 500ppi +, because even so it is enough for an ultra-sharp representation. The contrast is 1400: 1, the Candela value with 550 is identical to the 6 model. The display quality is outstanding from every angle, even in extremely bright lighting conditions very well. However, under the touch field, a lot has happened. The iPhone 6s comes with a 64-bit A9 processor, which should be 70% faster than the "old" A8 processor from the 6 and 6+. The graphics performance should even have increased by 90%. In addition, the RAM has been doubled to 2GB. The "third" processor in the heart of the iPhone 6s relieves the two main processors and takes care of "low-energy tasks" such as fitness data or Siri. This spares the smaller battery. "But other smartphones have 4GB of RAM." "That's true, but iPhones need significantly less RAM than the quad-core devices with Android, as they are very efficient with the memory and unused apps virtually" freeze "." Really noticeable The new processor is not - of course, apps start faster, everything runs smoother and softer than ever. The battery has been reduced from 1810mAh to 1715mAh, even the stronger processor needs more "juice" than the A8. However, this is barely noticeable - a reduction of about 30min to 1 hour on the standby during intensive use.Maybe a bit sad, but somewhere the stronger processor and the 3D display must be accommodated. Impressive is how Apple's engineers manage to maximize the battery life and almost on the level of the iPhone 6 with almost twice as strong processor and smaller battery capacity. You can easily get through the day with the battery, with me it is even enough for 1, 5 days of intensive use, ie: WhatsApp, emails with Push, Facebook, Safari, etc.In the competition also significantly higher battery capacity is set, for example, the Samsung S6 Edge has 2550mAh. The revolutionary change in the 6s is the 3D touch. A cool feature, which is not compatible with every app at the moment. The display notices with what intensity you press on it. Peek & pop is the keyword. If you press a little harder on an SMS, you get a small preview without opening it. If you press it down again, the complete SMS will be displayed. An example. On the homescreen that works too - if you now press a little harder on the camera app, you can directly select whether you want to take a video, a photo or a selfie. The camera of the iPhone 6s shoots very good photos and takes synonymous Videos in 4k (30fps) and 1080p (up to 60fps) on! Slow motion videos are possible in 1080p (120fps) and 720p (240fps). The selfie camera has been significantly improved, there is also the screen brightness acts as a flash. The Touch ID feels even better. Lightning fast, the home screen opens after a short press on the home button and scans within a few milliseconds the finger. Apple offers the 16GB version for € 739, the 64GB for € 849 and the 128GB version for € 959. I prefer the 64GB version because I often shoot videos and shoot pictures - making the 16GB completely useless, as a one-minute 4k video can take up to 500Mb === For me, really one of the best smartphones currently and yes I have Tested Android smartphones. Valuable, elegant and sturdy case, a powerful A9 processor with more memory, a revolutionary 3D touch display and the two cameras were both significantly improved. The battery capacity is a little weaker on the paper, I hardly notice anything. The only drawback is here as always: The very high PRICE, especially if you prefer more memory. If you can overlook it, I can get the latest smartphone from Apple just recommend. If you already have the iPhone 6, I would wait at least a year, because in my eyes a change is not worthwhile.	1
Delivery and sales process flawless. You do not need to say much about the iPhone, it's just an iPhone with the usual reliability and performance.	1
I ordered the iPhone 6s on Amazon for a long time. At first I was very skeptical, because it is a lot of money. However, the smartphone has been with me in Austria within 3 days. Original packed by Apple. It's been 2 months since then and I'm very happy with it. Would order it again immediately. LG Sarah	1
Does the iPhone 6s have a better price-performance ratio? "" - This question I asked myself when buying a new iPhone. In this review, I would like to answer for whom this question with "" YES "" answer. The most important Features that differentiate the iPhone 7 from the 6s: - Insulation against spray water - better camera (especially the optical image stabilizer [OIS] is an advantage here) - Headphone jack falls away (for me a clear negative point and would be problematic in my use, because I would need an adapter) - stereo speakers (in which case the lower speaker has a better quality & "" from below "" comes and the upper behind the speaker grille on the front or is mainly made for the phone speaker strictly speaking, one can question the term "stereo speakers" here because they are not equivalent) - other color variants (if that's good, everyone has to decide for themselves) - e twas stronger performance (in terms of processor and interconnect technologies; It should be noted that the difference between 6 and 6s is significantly larger than when comparing 6s vs. 7) - the battery life is better (probably the biggest plus point of the iPhone 7 [7: 1960 mAh, 6: 1715 mAh]), about 2 hours depending on the usage it is longer than the 6s; During the day, but with moderate use synonymous with the 6s is quite good - the iPhone 7 receives a little longer software updates than the 6s should be considered when buying 759 € iPhone 7 32GB. 649 € iPhone 6s 32GB is still the juxtaposition of the 2 most important points (larger battery & better camera). the extra charge of € 110 and you should not forget the missing headphone jack on the iPhone 7 of course (if you, such as I use wired headphones daily, this criticism can be deleted with an adapter, however.) Once again as a reminder to the beginning asked question: "" Does the iPhone 6s have a better price-performance ratio? "" Answer: "" YES "", if one of the two last mentioned, most important distinguishing features are not very important and the headphone jack in everyday life should not be missing (although If an adapter solves the problem with the iPhone 7, there are even some where you can listen to music and charge the iPhone at the same time, but the more stable & reliable solution is a fixed jack connection).	1
As always happy with the new Iphone. There are all sorts of new gadgets, running smoothly and having a very good camera. The new slow-motion feature is a lot of fun, just like the GIF images that are automatically created when you take a picture. The nitty-gritty thing that can still be developed is the animated backgrounds. You can only move them by holding your finger on the screen. It would be much better if the animations move on their own, as is the case with Android phones. Otherwise, I am as always enthusiastic about the Iphone.	1
I'm super satisfied with the iPhone 6s now I have 7 months old and had no problems great part the next come iPhone 8 or X.	1
That was the total surprise for Christmas. An iphon 6s. I had the 5s! Was satisfied with it. But the new is better for you. Has many innovations! I am happy!	1
Really a great phone! Especially the fingerprint sensor is very convincing! Many cool features! Only the battery leaves much to be desired ... otherwise perfect!	1
In my opinion, the phone is good for a lot and has great quality. Has everything a smartphone needs, the video quality is really great and the battery lasts all day without problems.3D touch, I also find a really good feature. The fingerprint scanner is super fast and works really well.	1
I would like to make an honest opinion regarding the iPhones. This goes to all those who are looking for a robust reliable smartphone and can do without settings and expansion Schnick Schnack. I have owned iPhones for years and am now completely satisfied with the 6S. The camera is great, software runs as usual clean and does not crash. It is high-quality processed and makes like its predecessors after years without grumbling his service. I use it every day and am not a man of the extremes on his phone watching falls pre-programmed. Since I have all my photos and important data on the phone, it is important to me that the device does not give up its ghost overnight. The predecessor iPhones were already washed at 60C and after a couple of dry days even these two have worked again. So it is really robust and can be sold even after two years for good money.	1
The iPhone 6 was already flawless, sometimes viewed that the pictures in bad light were not the ultimate. So really bad "" flagship smartphones "" is not there since 2014/2015. The 6s has the right size in my eyes , runs without jerks and makes beautiful pictures. iOS is a round system and self-explanatory on all devices. My wife has a 7 plus. Apart from the homebutton, there is not really much new to it. The processor is faster only on the sheet, you do not get that in reality. I also had the 8 in the hand, which is not much spectacular, let alone, I would never mind to spend 900 ¬, although my 6s almost everything is just as good. I also use in parallel my Galaxy A5 (2017), which is also a good device. But that is now too exasperating. The 6s is super processed, the battery brings me through the day and I find nothing that I would complain about so casually. Used for a relatively narrow thaler and thus a real candidate when 7,8 & X are too expensive.	1
I bought the iPhone 6s because I've been working for a long time with the now very outdated iPhone 4s. I bought it almost 3 years ago and have not had any negative experience yet. I'm happy every time I buy Apple products. Be it new, or used the iPhone 6s you get even for just under 250 ¬ and for this price you get a lot of mature technology. Would always buy new products from Apple.	1
For a long time I was Apple - "" Opponent "" and I refused to buy an iPhone because the price is quite high. At some point I discovered the iPhone 6s and fell in love immediately. The design is just great. Looked for a cheap version on Amazon and compared to Media Markt and Saturn really saved a lot of money. The iPhone arrived fairly quickly (faster than expected), the packaging was undamaged and sealed. I'm super happy with the phone and I'm not happy about it, as with Samsung, so many useless apps that you can not delete!	1
As a newcomer and longtime user of Android, I can only say that iOS is the much better OS. Any operation is again so easy that one does not get it first. And it is the same in all applications. Why I just did not switch earlier ???? The seller: BlackPrime has done everything properly.	1
A super nice and fully functional mobile phone !!! I love it!! Again and again only IPhone !!!!! Buy without hesitation !!! Cool	1
I've been thinking longer whether I should buy the iPhone here on Amazon or in the trade, because I was afraid because of the price, it could be a Nachmache.Das iPhone came 2 days after I ordered it so completely normal, through Amazon certainly packed Originally it was packed and it is really an original Apple iPhone. I'm super happy with the phone and would not exchange it I can only recommend!	1
Am after several years Android on Samsung S3 / S5 on the iPhone 6s switched. I have never regretted this change. Here are the pros and cons of the 6s: + The biggest advantage: the iPhone does not slow down or has more crashes with time. After a year at Samsung I always had the feeling that the phone is 10 years old. Ongoing crashes and a noticeable slowdown in the operating system. The apps and the operating system are running extremely stable at Apple. A crash of the phone I have never had and the apps max. once a month. + class design + super operating system, where it takes a little getting used to without back and menu button. I honestly miss the back button now and then, but the solutions are okay with Apple. + Setup and start is super fast, only one sign up at Apple (Samsung felt 100 accounts necessary to use all pre-installed apps) + Only the most necessary apps pre-installed (photo, calendar, etc.) + I've bought an iPad and the data transfer and setup was so ingeniously simple and well linked, but a huge plus + Camera, TouchID, 3D Touch .....- The only major disadvantages for me is the weak battery. However, a day is good in it and synonymous with Samsung I had to always load in the evening, as well as this battery no complete. 2days stops	1
Very happy with the new true. , , With. F o n d l i Chen G.	1
Once Apple - always Apple. ;-) The size of the smartphone is initially getting used to, of course. However, streaming on the screen at the size is clearly more enjoyable than at 4.7 "" and smaller! Anyone who does a lot online on the iPhone will appreciate the size. The usual very good feel and the wonderful resolution speak for themselves again! :-) The color (rosé-gold) for women (next to the golden version) is beautiful to look at. The improved resolution of the front and rear camera is great! The pictures are very good quality. Thumbs up for that! Tip: a bulletproof glass as a screen protector is a must for the (unfortunately) vulnerable displays. Can be obtained super cheap on the Internet, as prices in the shops are frequently overpriced. Who wants to have no scratches on the back of the good smartphone, which is a shell to heart - also cheap to obtain via the Internet. :-) To iOS itself: the apps run as usual stable and with the help of the cloud, you can really secure everything necessary data (my last iPhone was recently stolen and I can lock and restore everything via the cloud!). The EUR 0.99 for the cloud (from 5GB it costs something) is highly recommended to any user! Conclusion: Apple is still moving in the higher-priced segment with its products. For these products, however, the very good workmanship, the coordinated software and the sheer endless variety of good apps and accessories always speak in favor! Quiet access! :-)	1
I bought the iPhone 6S at LivingTronics on Amazon and it arrived after 5 days at my home, still sealed.	1
Good phone! It gets along great, once Apple always Apple.It is pretty thin and fits well in the hand	1
One can and should never compare Android with IOS .... I used to be an absolute Apple refuser !!! But the security and stability, which offers me Apple .. Can not even muster Android.Sicherlich is the pure matter of taste? But I never want to use anything other than Apple again. I also switched from Microsoft to OS XI Mac, which allows me to work a lot of carefree work	1
As a prehistory I have to say that I'm a long-time Android user and I now next to my almost obsolete iPad Mini (still running super thanks to regular updates) have bought a brand new iPhone 6s niegel.-Size / DeviceThe device has with the Measures 138 * 67 * 7 mm (length * width * height) and a weight of 143 grams for the perfect dimensions and is great in the hand. It bothers me a bit that the camera on the back sticks out a bit, but I have anyway a silicone sleeve. Screen with a diagonal of 4.7 "" = 11.94 cm and the resolution of 1334 * 750 pixels (326 ppi ), the screen is sharp. It has the perfect size to be operated with one hand and is not too big as for example with a Samsung Galaxy Note.-PerformanceWith the latest A9 chip, Apple also puts on a super stak chip of the mobile in 3-5 Years still usable. This is also because the Apple as a zigster manufacturer even after years of updates for the devices brings out. As I said, the processor is very powerful and it can really all apps are operated, whether 4K video editing or 3D rendering. Camera The camera can record videos with a resolution of up to 3840 * 2160 pixels (ie 4K) and 30 FPS. It is possible to record slow motion videos with 120 FPS at a resolution of 1080p and 240 FPS with 720p. In addition, the camera has a 3x zoom. Of course, the camera can also take photos with 12 megapixels. Battery The battery will last a day without problems and can be brought from 20% within 2 hours back to 100%. I hope I could help with the purchase decision In addition, I would be pleased if I am Amazon Vine product tester and can still write reviews for many other smartphones and can help in the purchase decision.	1
I get along so well with the iPhone 6s. At first attempt! Can be set up well and is clearer than other phones in my opinion. I thought that the color gold might be a bit too "blatant" but it is nice and discreet.	1
I have been an iPhone user for 3 years. I used to own the Samsung Galaxy s4 and it got broken pretty quickly. I have to say that it has fallen down to me - BUT on iPhones this does not seem to be a problem. My old iPhone 5s has had to endure a lot (falls to the ground and once in the toilet), however, it worked perfectly until I bought the iPhone 6s. I love slightly larger phones and the design I like the 6s very well. The display is large enough, the IOS system is generally very simple too I'm a huge fan of Apple, since I had to experience a lot with Samsung. I have now ordered a bulletproof film and this meets their purpose to 100%. My cell phone has fallen down as well, however It always has a shell around and the film and I have not a single scratch. The invented by Apple fingerprint works flawlessly, the battery lasts long enough (unless you play the S long piel 8pool;) The camera is great - for me, no other cell phone has such a good camera and the standard editing capabilities are completely aus.Fazit: The iPhone 6s is very user-friendly and is in the price-performance ratio very satisfactory! I love it	1
The iPhone 6s is just great, I can recommend it to anyone. It is super fast and very thin.	1
what woman always wanted / should have. , , , , , , , , , , , ,	1
Great device! Can not say anything negative about it. Only positive. Unfortunately, I just do not want to enumerate everything really, but why enumerate all the positive, if there is nothing negative?	1
It was probably not very surprising when Apple had announced the 6S, because we had become accustomed since the iPhone 4, that there would always be a successor before the next generation appeared. This kind of development can perhaps be described quite well as evolution, and the leap to a new number is then a revolution, because experience shows that the previous S-offshoots have always been the more perfected forms of their direct predecessors. Similarly, in my opinion, so too the iPhone 6S.Man had always criticized the 8 megapixel camera, which still made brilliant pictures despite the low MP count. After all, Samsung had already presented 16 megapixel cameras - interestingly, they rowed back in this regard - and let's not forget the camera smartphone from Nokia with its 43 megapixels. With the 6S has now for the first time 12 megapixel rear camera and a 5 megapixel front camera installed. A good development, in my opinion, on the quality of the images, however, does not change much. Still, the camera of the iPhone makes beautiful pictures, especially in daylight, at night, however, reveal a few weaknesses, admittedly. Nevertheless, one should not forget that we are talking here about a smartphone camera, which reaches in good lighting conditions quite a digital camera! What's new? Similar to the Apple Watch, the 6S now has a special haptic feedback on the display, 3D -Touch called. Certainly, most people will know it from advertising: If you press more easily on the display you get, for example, a preview of an e-mail and if you press harder, opens this mail. I have to confess, so far it's a nice feature, but it's not quite mature yet. This may also be due to the fact that one is too used to the classic pressure and one never really thinks that one can press more or less strongly on the display. However, the possibilities that this feature can have in the future are very diverse and Apple must be acknowledged to have brought a new innovation to the market - and the fact that there are already the first Android devices that mimic this feature , but shows that it seems to have a certain value. Of course, in the 6S, the new processor was installed, which now allows an even higher speed, but the speed of the iPhones is already so high that this appreciation hardly into the Weight seems to be falling. Despite a small memory of 2 gigabytes compared to Android devices, multitasking on the iPhone is absolutely no problem. Even with five or more games open, you can easily switch between them. Generally speaking, iOS is still one of the most potent and fastest operating systems on a smartphone. As a former Android user, I really appreciate this fact, because on Android there was this wonderful message 'Out of memory', which wanted to tell you that you had too many apps open at the same time, with the iPhone this has not happened to me yet. In general, one has to say, the iOS is running extremely stable. So far, I've never experienced an app that's frozen.I do not have to mention that the App Store offers probably the widest range of applications, nor do I have to mention that the accessory market for iPhones is much richer than for any other smartphone in the world. Another word on the new Touch ID and Many users complained that the new Touch ID was too fast, and in fact you just have to put your finger on the Home button and the fingerprint sensor will react. If you are really bothered by this, just press the button with a non-scanned finger, then the screen will not unlock. I can only say that I find it incredibly practical and fascinating how easy and uncomplicated Touch ID has become. Of course, this fingerprint sensor is not comparable to devices that play in a professional league, but you must not forget that we have here a smartphone in front of us. Online banking I would not do with the Touch ID, but to unlock the display or as a replacement for a password it is enough anyway. Many users have also complained about the smaller battery. I also had the iPhone 6, which had a nominally larger battery, but I have to say that it seems to me as if the battery in the 6S larger. With average use of the iPhone - Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox, taking photos and a bit of gaming - I still have 50 or 40 percent left over at the end of the day, which I consider a decent performance. Strangely, I never got that far on the iPhone 6, so I had to load much earlier. Of course, this is a matter of individual settings. If you set up your apps correctly, especially with regard to the background updates and the location access, you can gain a lot of battery power. Everything is perfect? ​​Unfortunately no. Still extremely annoying is the camera protruding from the case. On the one hand, this design looks extremely ugly, on the other hand, one always has the feeling that the lens of the camera can break faster. I can understand that you want to have the thinnest smartphone in the world, but the few millimeters, so that the camera would have been flush with the case as the iPhone SE, would not have been bad. Also, the display of the iPhone is still very good, offers natural colors and a high viewing angle stability, but still Apple should think about installing a higher-resolution display. It does not have to be the magical 4K or the UHD, but a few pixels more than it could already be for the price. My bottom line is that the 6S has been refined and perfected in many ways, but it still offers potential for upside, Even if the points of criticism I have mentioned are more like whining at a high level, one can expect a similarly high level of equipment and perfection for the comparatively high purchase price of the device.	1
I've always opted against iPhones, because I was the display size just too small. So I had previously a htc one X htc one and last a Samsung Galaxy s4.I must say I was thrilled from the first second iPhone 6s The optics and the feeling of having it in your hand are simply not a second time, and I'm also very excited about the battery life. Yes, the batteries are smaller than in the other smartphones in this price category, however, the software is tuned so that the battery simply holds incredibly well. Besides, it's just outstanding when gambling, the graphics are brilliant and stuttering is out of the question, I've had it for a good 10 weeks now and did not have a crash or any other bad experience with the iPhone. Of course it can recommend it to anyone, of course only if you are also ready to pay the price, which is really high, but I do not regret a penny.	1
The iPhone 6s has a good resolution so you can really make very nice pictures which is really important to me personally !! Keep it up	1
Hardly different from the old 5s, but if you already know Apple, it's just impossible to settle for anything else. Despite the price, I always buy a newer model and I am thrilled. The phone just reads the thoughts.	1
I have to admit that I'm completely in love .. The software just does the hardware .. It's all in sync .. It's a special charm that makes Apple products .. man must like it or not .. I had to go too get used to it first .. But after 3 good weeks you do not want to take any Android device into your hands anymore .. Love it	1
The bad 1 star reviews are just fakes so it sells worse. Every Iphone has been fine so far, I've never broken one by falling or anything else. You know ITunes, you know it beforehand, it totally depends on you, it works without it. But you do not need antivirus or similar scrap like that on Android devices because you can download apps etc only from the store and not directly from the browser zB.Gutes Iphone!	1
Honestly, just to award a star for the new iPhone is absolutely nonsense. I've had every device since the iPhone 3 so far. In between, to let me not be dazzled by the Apple glasses also current premium android (HTC, Samsung) and even the Windows offshoot (Lumia). The iPhone is by far the best-functioning smartphone on the market. Yes, it is more expensive (but still worth something after a year or two). The only criticism for me as a user is still the partially confusing iTunes.	1
As every year, the Apple community is waiting eagerly for the new iPhone and hopes for new features and features. After the presentation on 9 September is certain. Apple once again found a unique selling proposition and introduced it first. In this case, the 3D Touch. The detection of varying degrees of pressure on the touch screen. I am very curious how it will be in everyday life. It sounds very promising!	1
because my sony (not even 1 year old) had spun and I was always annoyed that no cell phone holds long (yes, I use it 24/7) I decided after a long back and forth but for an apple phone can indeed the whole appel ah and anbet zeug ned understand but must say the technology is (NO) ok and everything hopefully holds this handy longer what I found stupid therefore a star away .. other charging cable! HELLO? -.- all phones have the same plug and you..then why should not I make my own ringing tone? that is really annoying.why can I specify with ithunes no paypal? that you should change timesAccount 19.10.2018Bin very satisfied with the HandyKlar that I still need another plug I still find stupid but the technology is still fully functional even after 2 years! Addition 09/07 / 19Always more than satisfiedElles runs perfectly and the phone is very robust. I'm very used to it and I'm happy to have bought itEbenso everything is still like the first dayNaturally it has some traces of use but this is very limited	1
an original boxed brand new iPhone with full factory warranty!	1
I bought the phone for my mother, it works fine and you do not realize that it was refurbished. Battery also holds great.	1
so it was promised and in my opinion also kept. The phone comes in a beautiful box, covered with the usual protective film and is optically flawlessly beautiful - no scratches, no dent. Charger, cables and headphones are also included - just as original new although it is needed. I have tested the battery and he seems to be new to me. The running time is at least two days for my iPhone. I could not find any quirks. The Micro is good and the speakers sound loud and clear. There are no apps that crash and indicate hardware damage. The camera takes beautiful pictures and works flawlessly. I have now used it for five weeks and would buy it again. The review, however, refers to the company "" Nesatec "" from which I bought it. I'm completely satisfied.	1
I'm very satisfied with this product	1
We liked everything.	1
In conjunction with the Apple Watch and DEXCOM G6 a dream team -	1
Works flawlessly. Very well . The device is fluid and interesting. Camera is also good. Good resolution and has nothing to complain about.	1
Assume that it was a very good buy!	1
I am very satisfied with the phone	1
I have a joy to my girlfriend and myself for Christmas 2018 with a 6s +. Mine in Space Gray and hers in Rose Gold.My parents have then let out a short time later, a 6s + and are also excited. The change from Android to iOS, none of us has regretted. The 6s + has (18/19) a very good price / performance ratio and makes no problems in daily use, although it is already "" older "" is a real alternative If you do not want to afford an iPhone X (justifiably) but still enjoy the benefits of Apple / iOS. The phone has probably already fallen 1,000 times, but with a Spigen case and a 08/15 "" bulletproof glass "" Film is not a problem. The phone itself has not a single scratch. In case of a fall, I'll buy a 6s + again or let's see how until then the prices for the successor have developed.Bis now completely satisfied and that will certainly remain so for a long time.	1
I have the 6s plus only for 2 weeks in use. To my predecessor 5c this iPhone is absolutely sharp. Especially the 64 bit system is now future-oriented and I can again u.a. Take full advantage of my Smart Home products. Apple Apple phones are just good. The 5.5-inch display is great for a 3 year old device	1
Very fast delivery. New and OVP. Beautiful IPhone 6s Plus! It's not so easy to get a really new smartphone on the internet ...	1
I had the iPhone 6 and 6 plus, but then I returned to Samsung after years, because personally I found the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge so beautiful. That turned out to be really a mistake because Samsung, as always, is not nearly as fluid and enjoyable as Apple The fingerprint sensor at Samsung is the purest catastrophe, where at Apple, the thing is just running and always works top Samsung leaves to be really wishful about. Now I'm back to the iPhone 6s Plus 128gb and I'm so happy, it's really just better, faster and feels better. Apple has learned from the glass back of the iPhone 4, the aluminum at this point is simply much better, unfortunately, Samsung did not understand that .. I can advise everyone and repeat what my daughter says, once Apple always Apple .. Me had made the mistake and will never do it again .. Apple is running and doing better, faster and more reliably like everybody else ..	1
Already got the message that the money is on the way to my bank I am amazed at so much speed As here during the day I can only say Amazon hat off class	1
This is very good phone	1
Great product like every Apple. All people what writing bad stuff need to check reference and description of the product on Apple website and then decide to buy or not to buy. I was using iPhone 6s all this time and now buy XS and I love it. Friend of mine used 8-9 years iPhone and now he bought  Samsung because was cheaper than iPhone and he regretted. All this will understand iPhone lovers. You can’t compare this phone with Huawei.. it’s funny review who wrote that.	1
It is all of the things you come to expect from Apple. High quality, a phone that is more NASA than NASA. And very expensive. I'd still highly recommend Apple products, and no, I'm not an Apple fanboy. I'm sure the same could be said of the top end other smartphones.	1
Arrived swiftly and perfectly packaged. Adore the phone. Cannot recommend enough!	1
Very expensive, but the best phone money can buy. I bought mine a few months ago on a special deal, I got a 256gb fir the price of a 64gb.Over the last few months this phone has obliterated anything thrown at it from intensive programs to 4K live streams, augmented reality it can handle anything, it is raw power. Battery life is poor, if you are a power user you will be out of charge within 6 - 8 hours. So keep that in mind. I’ve dropped this phone on solid marble tiles and it didnt leave a scratch, they are durable, but take no risk, buy a sturdy case.It’s a great phone, the best money can currently buy, but wait for the prices to drop, because they are very expensive,l.	1
Item came quicker than expected and everything was as expected so over all very happy with the service and product.	1
I was getting tired of getting huge phones, and iphone xs is perfect size. it is also blazingly fast. Yes, it is not cheap at all, but bear in mind that you can resell for a higher price that you would resell an android, so, in the end, you are not throwing away all this money in a phone, since it has good reselling.	1
Takes a bit of getting used to but a great phone	1
Excellent deal on this saving £250 versus apple store price!	1
Was skeptical but a genuine Apple iPhone sold directly from Apple. Arrived new and unlocked in a sealed box with all the accessories (lightning charger, headphones, lightning to 3.5mm adapter etc). Managed to get a 256gb for the same price as you’d get a 64gb buying from Apple direct.	1
Good prompt communication and fast delivery. Product new and boxed as described. Usual Apple high standard iPhone. Many thanks	1
Awesome.	1
Great	1
Good	1
This phone is amazing. It’s fast, it has great battery life, does great pictures and gold color is so pretty, every time I look at it I’m just so happy I bought this iPhone 😁	1
Great price for a 256GB model (£999). The 64GB model is this price from the apple store	1
Quick delivery.  I went for the 512gb model.  After using it for the last few days I am very impressed.  Face ID is very responsive.  Great phone!	1
Great phone does everything well	1
Nice phone	1
Takes fantastic photos, everything else is very Apple.	1
I love this phone	1
Excellent product	1
Like it but not worth 1k	1
A vast improvement to my glitchy, slow iPhone 7	1
Good product and quality. The delivery was really fast within one day!	1
Best iPhone ever	1
so in love with this phone, 100% recomended	1
Flawless.	1
Vivid and sharp display, amazing camera, easy to use with one hand, extremely fast, and more responsive than any other phone I have used. Overall, this is a great phone and I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an iPhone 7 or older.	1
Unlike the android stuff out there, this phone effortlessly links all your apple products together for seemless operation	1
Great camera great screen overall amazing phone	1
Really was unsure about the value for money with this phone as you can get more storage and performance for less money from other phone companies.However this little phone has really surprised me! Super quick and responsive, great to have a little more storage for photos etc. Camera performs really really well.Overall really pleased, fantastic phone. Would recommend for anyone who is an apple person :)	1
Had this phone for about 6 weeks now, what a great phone! I was still on an iPhone 6 (which I’ve used for the past 4 years, that served me well) so this was an amazing upgrade for me. 256gb for under 1k is a good price, looks good, feels lovely, works fast, photos are excellent! Glad I made this purchase, would highly recommend if upgrading from any phone 3 - 4 years old!	1
It takes a bit of getting used to and I really miss the button but face recognition is great.  Love the  quality of the camera.	1
Absolutely brilliant phone. Have it for 6 months everything completely fine. Battery life is around 2 days but I am using it al lot	1
It's an iPhone - quality is 100% and I got a good deal from Amazon, compared to Apple Store.	1
As described	1
Love the iPhone XS	1
Great product and with a discount. What’s not to like.	1
love it	1
Really pleased with the phone	1
it's for gift.good prise	1
Good	1
Fantastic	1
Was not sure if i will get used without the home button or not,or if it would be worthy to get it. But i love it	1
Good value.jb	1
It is a sturdy and quality phone you can feel it. It has perfect analogies size of the phone and size of the display, for people that do not want big phones but want clear view of the screen. But those qualities you can find them on iPhone x also and if someone does not care to have full display screen phone then in iPhone 7 without paying 1000 pounds or so. There is no value for money here.	1
First of all, the name of this iPhone is slightly confusing. XS Max. XS would normally indicate something that is extra small and max would usually suggest maximum size. However, there is absolutely no confusion about the quality of this product.If you look beyond the puzzling name, you'll be staring into the deep black depths of a stunning 6.5-inch OLED Super Retina display. Have you ever wanted to stare deep into the abyss of a black hole? Well, now you can for just £1,249. I went for the Space Grey colour option, due to the mystery and unknown that is often associated with outer space.The battery life is fantastic so far, lasting around a day and a half with moderate use. As opposed to my previous iPhone 7, which lasted about as long as a typical Tinder relationship. Ironically, this app was not only detrimental to the battery life of the iPhone 7, but also as my actual life.This iPhone has been my first experience using Face ID. I now wish that I could unlock more things using my face.The A12 bionic chip is a marvel. I can now switch between apps and ignore my friends and family up to 15% faster than ever before. Additionally, with the dual SIM slots, I can now be ignorant at home as well as abroad.I have found the Screen Time App to be particularly useful. Not only does it pin point the exact time of day that I miss my ex-girlfriend, it also shows me exactly how addicted to this phone I really am.Overall, my verdict of the iPhone XS Max is this: it may not solve the inner torment and angst that we all go through as human souls. It is however, a lovely distraction.	1
At £100 off at Amazon this phone is worth it.	1
It’s an Apple iPhone. Ofc it’s going to be a good phone. It is overpriced but that’s nothing new! Great phone tho. Best iPhone so far.	1
Did not surprise my neighbor, so he give it to me. I feel it’s great though.	1
Have used iPhones for many years, love this one, it is the best. Love the face recognition, also very fast and so easy to use. Great camera too, only thing it is a bit pricey. I'm not a lover of contracts.	1
Very very happy with the item got a good deal from amazon and I’m happy with amazon customer service too. The iPhone is very beautiful. Theirs no problem with it so far everything is going great.	1
All of it about my ne IPhone XS Max was	1
Perfect size and super fast. You don’t need anything else.	1
As far as I’m concerned there’s nothing I don’t like about this phone, apart from the cost of course, but it’s an Apple product so you would expect that. Just de-boxing the phone is a sensual experience to be savoured. Yes, it’s too expensive but I love it!I’ve been used to an iPhone 6s and compared to that the battery life is unbelievable. Only had it a couple of days but I’ve not got anywhere near needing to plug it in for a to up during the day. I’m sure it will go for around one and a half days of reasonable use. The camera is superb and I’ve not experienced and problems so far with the facial recognition that is so much better than the fingerprint recognition. As for the home button - I though I might miss that and find myself desperately poking the bottom of the phone to switch back to home but I’ve not done it once yet.	1
Absolutely amazing phone. I switched from android after 4 years without an iPhone and it was so easy to get back into it.  It’s crazy how many things you can do with this phone.  Great for phone.  The battery is absolutely amazing	1
Amazing	1
Apple are always overpriced but my wife is apple daft as shes an instagrammer blogger so I decided to get her this for Christmas. It broke but apple repaired this under warranty. She loves the size of the memory and battery life is alot better than previous iPhones.	1
Great phone	1
Great stuff as usual apple .	1
best iPhone ever, but a little more heavy than expected. I upgraded my old iPhone 6S to this new XS Max.	1
Amazing value for money, £100 less than anywhere else	1
Fast and easy	1
The phone is just perfect.Lots of issues about the order dispatching, but thanks to the dedicated support team, everything ended well.	1
Pricey but good	1
ExcellentApple just keep getting better and better	1
Thanks	1
very nice product	1
Love the phone!	1
Great product as usual.	1
after i spent my childrens collage funds on this phone my wife left me and took the kids. Would buy again	1
I've bought it for my ten years old son as the first phone,he is quite happy with that.	1
Had to sell my right liver on some dodgy website for £1500 because the nhs wouldn't buy it. Then i bought this phone, well worth the price.	1
you will need a bank loan to buy it! :D The new 6.5 OLED screen is a major update to the iPhone X and the new camera is amazing.	1
Bought this by remortgaging and couldn’t be happier! I have it in a protective case and a glass screen protector, do not give it to the kids and wouldn’t take it to work or nights out just in case its lost or stolen but yeah very happy knowing i have one of these. Hey some like smoking some snort it and some inject it but i just look at it, thats my high.	1
If anyone would love to buy one for me that would be much appreciated	1
Amazing phone I’m so glad I bought it, it came earlier than it should’ve but the track on amazon carried on going and I was worried If it meant I bought another so I stopped that, amazing phone love it	1
Battery life is very good and great screen size	1
Beautiful phone expensive though	1
I have used the phone extensively at the Apple store as well as through my friend who bought one recently.What's in the box?• Apart from the phone, Lightning EarPods, Lightning to USB cable, user guide and standard 5W Power Adapter are included.Screen -This screen is very good! Very crisp and vibrant. However, I feel the blacks are not as deeper to the naked eye. The maximum brightness level is very good. This is even more than the closest Android rival Galaxy Note 9.The size of screen is 6.5 inches diagonally. The resolution is 1242 x 2688 pixels. The notch on the top of the screen may keep people divided.Build Quality-Very good. In par with the iPhone X /Galaxy Note 9 and probably better than Google Pixel 2 phone. Non removable back.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, and the sterio speakers are more than adequate. Has NO headphone jack. There is no headphone jack compatible dongle either included,  but you can buy it easily.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag at all.Is the 4 GB RAM not adequate? I think it is. I found no lag in how the phone functioned, despite lower RAM compared to the Android counterparts.Added features-Micro SD slot is NOT available. This phone is water and dust (IP68) resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP DUAL lens back camera.Very good photos in good daylight. Good low light photos as well. The front camera is good at 7MP, but could have been better(may be a front flash next time?) Good for selfies but nothing compared to the back camera.The cameras are identical to iphone X on paper, but the end results are ever so slightly better and consistent. The low light photos are better because the pixel sizes are bigger.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good. But then it has to be bought through an authorised reseller.However, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon. You can purchase additional warranty through Apple care.Battery-Very good 3174 mAH battery. There is a quick charge function. But this is not as fast as the dash charge in One plus 5/6.You may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one day of use on this, if you are a moderate to heavy user.Operating System-Runs iOS 12 out of the box, and this runs brilliantly. Apple do the software side of things in a more mature way than Android counterparts including Samsung. The icons per se are much more mature than Samsung. iOS 12 is fluid and very easy to use. But iOS has its restrictions compared to Android, such as not being able to modify easily.Security features-Face ID works well and worked without an issue almost everytime I used it.No fingerprint sensor is available.Price-The recommended retail price at present is £999 for the 64GB version of iphone Xs and £1099 for 64GB version of iphone Xs Max, which is very steep. The RRP for the iphone Xs Max 512GB version is £1449 though, and think before you buy , do you actually need that amount of storage on the phone?Colour-It currently comes in space grey, silver and gold. If you like a clean look, then Space grey is your option. It gives a more official (but probably boring, according to some) look. If you buy the I personally feel the Gold colour is very nicely done, and is not gaudy at all.Dual sim?Dual sim is available through an Esim.Is there anything else I would have wished the iphone Xs to have?1. Headphone jack. This actually may not happen ever. But the truth of the matter is a jacked headphone so easy to use, and does not need re-charging, hence I love it , compared ot a Bluetooth headphone2. Notchless display3. Bigger battery (yes, 4000mAH next year may be? :) and faster quick charge function )4.Slightly better low-light photo performance.This, or the iPhone X?iphone X has been discontinued, so if you want to buy it brand new it won’t be available. But in the second hand market you could get the iphone X for about £400 less than Xs max, so if you don’t mind the size, iphone X may be a good option.So, you have the iphone X. Should you buy the Iphone Xs or Xs Max?On the surface, the iphone Xs is an incremental upgrade, and you may wonder whether you actually need the iphone Xs Max.But the short answer - yes you should probably still upgrade.Why?1. Iphone Xs has improvements such as slightly faster performance, better water/dust resistance (IP68 vs IP67), better camera for low light photos (see above for details) .2. One year down the line, the iphoneX will be valued at around £200 if you want to sell and upgrade to iphone 2019 (which is about £700 less than the RRP) and at present there are some good trade- in deals around for the iphone X. Hence, you probably would give your phone and upgrade for about £350 more, which I feel is reasonable.3. You will also have the latest tech in your hands!But, the ultimate decision is yours :)If you have Iphone 8/8 plus, should you upgrade?Short answer- yes you should. There is plenty of reason.Any questions about the  iphone Xs/Xs Max, please ask and I will try to answer them to the best of my knowledge.If you feel the review is unhelpful, can you please say why in the comments below, so I can improve my future reviews. Thank you.	1
A really great device and certainly the best on the market right now, at the cheapest price too - Normally retailers charge £200 for extra memory but Amazon don't, I bought this one as it has higher resale value and it really is a beautiful, great phone in the gold finish.	1
I tried an android, then a windows 10 phone, now it is time to have an iPhone. I am confident it will serve me well. Only time will tell.	1
Amazing phone. Delivery a slight issue. But happy.	1
WTF????	1
I’m really pleased with my phone..it was a very considered purchase but I got a good price for the amount of gb...Battery life but so sure about ...I gave to charge it everyday! I don’t know if that’s normal...I may have to check with Apple customer service team to check ...I love the face recognition it’s ace!	1
Great phone, got it cheaper here which was a bonus	1
nice item!	1
Great price, cheaper than apple store	1
The phone is bigger than the XS but retains all the good stuff. It's a solid phone with incredible battery life. The camera is as good and only lacks the zoom lens, which most people never use anyway. The screen is great, with great accurate colours. I am not used to OLED however and like LCD as a whole.The phone itself is quite large and thick (the latter is great for battery life) so I would recommend seeing one in person before purchase. It sits in between the XS and XS Max sizes. It is a fractionally smaller in size than 6/7/8 Plus phones but with a larger screen due to small edges.I was most worried about 3D Touch but they added similar long-presses for most convenient 3D Touch actions. I am a heavy user of 3D Touch and whilst I miss it in some areas it covers most of my needs. If you don't know what 3D Touch is... then great! Even less reason to buy the XS or XS Max.Unfortunately at full price still not a cheap phone but it's definitely not a low-effort product.	1
i've been an Android user for the last 6 years and just had endless problems and thought enough is enough and once i saw the XR and the specs, like everyone else i laughed and asked who would want this phone?  It wasn't until i went into the Apple Store that i saw the build quality and the screen and was blown away...how on earth is this screen only 828p? It looks sharp and gorgeous.I went for the White 64GB model which looks the best out of all of models in my opinion. The black front and the white back is like a storm trooper phone. Looks really nice and feels really nice in the hand. The new gestures are amazing, once you get used to them you can't go back. The phone is also so smooth and will stay smooth.The apps are of higher quality than i experienced on Android, Face ID is a revelation and a game changer. The camera is very good too, as good as a Pixel 3 (according to DXOMARK)All in all i'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend. if you are on an older iPhone or are thinking about switching over from Android then you won't be disappointed.	1
I bought this for my son for a Christmas present.  Choosing between the smaller OLED and this larger LED was difficult, but as my son mainly uses it for watching videos, video chat, and messaging, the larger screen size won out.The image quality is still excellent (and that is coming from an Adroid fan) and the overall build is really good too.Battery life is really good - His 2 year old 6s? would hold a charge for < 1 day.  This one lasts over 1 1/2 with quite heavy usage.As Apple Phones go, this was a tad expensive, but an overall good purchase.	1
My partner bought this for me (much to my surprise) and although I've only had it for a couple of days I would recommend it.  Just a couple of points that might be of interest to someone/anyone and that is although I entered the face recognition in the phone it so far has not opened with this feature.  I still have to enter a code manually.  Also, there is no button at the bottom of the phone to press, but I guess this is just something I am used to with my old iphone 6 and it is merely personal preference.	1
Upgrade from iPhone 7 loving the new screen size, functionality, smooth transition to the new device overall a joy	1
Totally love this phone, got every thing i need on it and easy to use.	1
Bought as a replacement for an iPhone 8, this is a useful step up. The larger screen makes a large difference to usability and is clear and bright. The FaceID works superbly, much better than TouchID. I am also really happy with the camera performance, the portrait mode works well. Overall a great phone and can use extensively during the day and still have 50% battery left which is a pleasant surprise.	1
Upgrading from the iPhone 7 I’ve noticed the difference with this bigger wider screen and, I must say, I’m simply loving it!!Battery last long time	1
I'm absolutely delighted with that phone. Yes it is a bit expensive but it is definitely worth it. I had some reservations regarding the screen, people say it is not oled etc. but the screen is actually amazing, I have compared it to the Xs next to each and that’s the only time when you can spot a difference and the extra money for the XS is not worth it, when you also take in mind that you get exactly the same chip processor! Runs great and the battery life is really good, for a heavy user a day and a half is not a problems!	1
As with most apple products if your an apple fan it does what it says on the tin,very easy to set up. Arrived on time c/w sim tool,charger cable and USB plug uk everything so far seems to work, and work well. Comes unlocked so any network can be used.face recognition is pretty cool too.	1
Upgrade from iPhone 6 with battery and other problems. This mobile is fast instinctive to use not too big and easy to transfer data via iTunes! As I am nearly 70 and managing technology easily and do not find the phone too large for small hands I am very happy with my choice and face recognition works really well	1
Love it. After switching to android I had load of problems so switched back to apple and got the xr and have no complaints as of yet. Would recommend	1
Great phone great battery life but expensive	1
I took the plunge and upgraded from an iPhone 6 to the XR and I have not looked back!  It is a fantastic phone and despite being worried about moving away from fingerprint recognition, I love the facial recognition!!!  I wish I had upgraded sooner to be honest!  I have gone from needing a charge twice a day (or more) to one every three or so days and even then, just to get it back to 100%!	1
Its amazing!!Awesome delivery service !!I love it, Thanks	1
My kids love it	1
Very good phone	1
All good	1
Best Iphone I’ve had so far	1
Love this iPhone, don’t know how much or if any improvements can be made to this great phone	1
Bought this phone as my last one stopped working. Got here quickly, works well and is unlocked so no issues using my existing sim. All round good quality	1
Excellent phone,lots of features longer battery life.	1
I recommended this product	1
Great phone. Big display, handles well, great buy	1
Very good phone for the price	1
Incredible value for money when up against the XS and XS Max, no big visual differences in Display or processing speed. The XR has the A12 Processor like the XS Max/XS so processing speed is the best you can get.	1
amazing	1
Great size.	1
Excellent , face recognition is best feature especially when using apps to login securely . Battery is also as good as they say	1
Overall it is a great phone	1
Best battery life ever on a phone, lasts over a day as well as fast performance and a great camera.	1
Great screen size and new features. Camera is great	1
Winner	1
Great phone	1
Superb battery life! I no longer need to take my charger outside with me.The size took some time to get used to but enabling ‘reachability’ in the settings made it way easier. This allows you to swipe down on the home bar to bring down the top half of the screen.Apple should have left it on by default instead of making you turn it on by yourself. You can turn on reachability by going to settings > general > accessibility > reachability.	1
This is a great phone, the battery life is superb, the screen although just over 720 resolution is really good, putting it next to the 6s plus you really can’t notice any difference in face sometimes text actually looked a little better on the XR, the camera is also superb and really good in low light, it really makes shooting at night a pleasure, although some are saying it’s a downgrade I disagree, it is overpriced for what you get 599 would be a more realistic price, I got mine for that price thanks to a 150 quid voucher, even 650 would be a reasonable price but 750 is to much, unless of course you are rolling in cash in which case you would maybe buy the Xs plus, however that thing is huge, this phone at 6.1 inches is in the sweet spot as also the display is quite long the widths not much more that a 6s and it fits in the hand nicely and is nice to type on to without many typos, all in all a very nice phone and I am very very happy with mine	1
I upgraded from an older iPhone 5s (which still runs all the apps I use but being in my 80s the small screen is now a bit of a struggle) so up from 4” to 6.1” and the XR is a beautiful upgrade in every respect.The A12 chip is about 5-6 times faster than the old 5S and has 200% more RAM, about 110% bigger screen area and with the 64gb version has about 50gb free space after system and apps etc. The stereo speakers are way above the anything you will find on the android phone and if like me you do not like using earphones this is a big bonus when listening to music or watching video etc.Face ID is a revelation!!! it was sharp and instant after setting up in the way required. I don’t miss the Home button at all. Just a flick of the finger takes you home, clears the screen of an app or brings back the apps you’ve been using and so no buttons to press at all. It automatically logs you in securely to websites and accounts et cetera. Everything about it is so smooth and slick compared to the android phones I have used and setup for others. At first I did baulk at the price over the iPhone 7Plus (5.5” screen) which will probably be discontinued this year with the arrival of iphone 11. Battery life of the XR has over the last few weeks of light use consistently delivered better than 2 days and photos are superb.  One criticism is the camera protruding from the case. This is not justified, see photoOverall, looking at the latest spec and what this includes, I think whilst it may be a luxury phone for me I have no regrets about spending the extra. The Apple combination of hardware and software clearly wins over other makers recipes in the use of Android.	1
I was one first person in the uk to buy the IPhone XR from Apple this is upgrade from my IPhone SE I love this phone better than Samsung S9 this phone 4K 60FPS	1
Had one since launch, they are brilliant. Best iphone i have ever had. The battery lasts ages.	1
I haven’t use it before love to have that	1
This phone is amazing !!! Everything I wished for and at such a good price ! Got the coral version and it looks stunning	1
You can clean the inside of the reusable straws from top to bottom easily with the extra long telescopic scrub brush. the length is adjustable so matches all sizes of cups in my home.	1
Which network this iPhone XR ?	1
Works great. Great price! Glad to choose it.	1
Funny the bad reviews are from people who havent even bought 1  No Verified purchase shown.Were as all verified purchases give 5 Stars ~ Do we have jealous Sansung owners here who bought the wrong phone?I am a Big Apple user tried phone as it was bought for my Grandaughter,we both love it has to be the best Apple phone yet. Since review have upgraded my i~phone 7 to a Xr with no regrets east traansfer off all dateNotice when orderingthe 128 gb is same price as the 64 gb price is the same	1
Upgraded from earlier iPhone and this is a much improved product. Selected 128 as apps require more capacity year by year and I don’t change my phone frequently. Camera quality is excellent and I like the larger screen. Battery life much improved.	1
Good quality phone. The colour is beautiful and works as expected. This was purchased as a gift for my mother and whilst she is making the move from Android, it appears she is pleased overall!	1
I really love this phone, the battery, design and resistance is really good	1
best iphone i ever purchased excellent iPhone, in fact regarding battery life while using bluetooth does not drain battery as bluetooth does on other models	1
Great product a nice size.	1
Thank you	1
Just a quick rundown previous phones ,I had all iPhone till the 8plus and sold my iPhone XI wasn’t going to pay over 1000 for a phone so got the pixel 3 to try out,returned other than the photos the phone for me had bad battery and log of glitches,so got a deal on the car black 128 gb Absolutely love it in every way screen to me is excellent ,camera still really good and the battery less about 2 days seriously surprisingly great phone	1
I upgraded from the 7 plus. I don’t  fancy plus sized phones anymore. The XR is the right size for me. The XS was too small for my liking. The battery life is the best I’ve seen  in a smartphone. The screen even though had a lot of negative reviews prior to its release is actually good. I think the 128 GB has more value for money.	1
Daughter loves it. I think they are overpriced bit teenagers disagree	1
easy to use, nice red case, love it	1
Not transfered across yet	1
Only downside Is battery life after a full nights charge is 24 hours. Even less if taking lots of voice calls. Otherwise a brilliant phone	1
The phone is amazing literally it does everything and more well worth the money and very light as well this is the best deal your gonna get for this phone and it come brand new as well ..so what are you waiting for get that wallet out.	1
everything perfect with one of the latest Iphone’s model, and I really love the Coral colour  🧡	1
When I ordered this I was a bit skeptical due to the reviews. It arrived earlier than expected. It’s a legitimate I Phone X, not a fake or refurbished one. It also comes with headphones and a charger.	1
Really good iPhone ! Arrived way earlier than expected so quite pleased. The phone is brand new and is just amazing !	1
supplier is amazing. Received this phone before the due date which was amazing. Phone was brandnew unlocked in it’s original packaging:-) Phone is good but don’t think apple is worth the price tag in what it actually is.	1
I received a genuine iPhone X, I was initially worried but on a second thought plus reviews; I decided to go for it. No disappointment, brand new phone and no problem.  Amazon called me to verify before authorising my purchase, even more better and more importantly cheap price I could get.	1
Purchased for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Arrived quickly and although it was a grade A used item, couldn't find a mark on it!12 month warranty gives peace of mind too.	1
I'm really happy so far. The camera is stunning. The portrait mode is great with the dynamic blurring in the background, and the ability to take lowlight photos now makes me really happy.The battery life lasts more than a day with me watching netflix and prime video all day which is really surprising.The facial recognition is absolutely great. Cold weather + gloves, not a problem anymore! Touchless payments is also great to have if I forget my wallet at home. Haven't had a single issue so far. Very fluid OS.The ONLY nuance is if you want to listen to music or something and charge your phone, which you can't do unless you either buy a wireless charger or use bluetooth earphones. Or you risk it and buy a 3rd party adapter to charge and use earphones but I don't feel comfortable doing that.Really useful having the 256GB. Overall a happy customer :) and great experience from Amazon as usual. Delivered next day	1
It's an iPhoneX, at good price - love it.	1
absolute bargain for the iphone 10  also arrived really quickly	1
Well pleased with my purchase at a more sensible price. The phone was never, in my view, worth the original asking price of £999. But still a excellent phone never the less. It is a brand new unit that so far has proven to be faultless. Delivered in real fast time too. You can find them a little cheaper, but this is a good buy.	1
I was most impressed by the condition of this phone - It was truly immaculate! Yes Battery was down to 96% of capacity but it is a used phone and the battery life is still way better than I was used to. Thanks very much! HIghly recommended!	1
Really happy with my purchase at a great price. I was a bit sceptical first buying a apple product on amazon but everything went fine and the phone is great	1
Best iPhone yet and at a good price, much cheaper than the Apple Store and comes with all the warranties and is new in the box	1
Great phone but not worth the money.	1
Very happy with the iPhone X its fast it’s camera is really good, I like everything about it	1
Came pretty quickly and in good condition. Didn’t come with earphones for hygiene reasons which is understandable but did have everything else. No problems with the phone so far.	1
Great product and fast shipping	1

Phone was perfect. Brand new sealed box. Great phone, if a touch expensive. Delivery was spot on too. Very pleased.	1
This is my 6th iPhone and in my opinion is the best yet. It took a little while to get used to using it compared to my iPhone 6s with no home button but comes naturally after a while. Photo quality is great as well and the battery life seems to last much longer.	1
Thank you, great company, had problem with charger, sorted the next day	1
Bought this for my son for Christmas. Was a bit skeptical as it was a couple of hundred pounds cheaper than going to Apple. Was brand new, so happy, will always look on Amazon when buying another phone	1
Great I phone , brill delivery .	1
Great phone no issues after 6 months	1
Love my new iPhone X. Went from a iPhone 5s to iPhone X. Picture quality is great. Battery life is brilliant. Can’t fault it.	1
Upgraded from an 8plus, enjoying the one-handed operation. My concernes about Face ID over the previous fingerprint scan were unfounded, I adapted quickly. Otherwise the quality of phone is as you would expect from Apple	1
Quality very good happy customer!	1
Had the phone for 5 months so far, everything works as expected	1
Arrived quickly and brand new phone. Really pleased with it.	1
Great phone. Very quick to arrive, easy to setup and great colour. 64GB gives plenty of storage space for my needs and the wireless charging makes it easy to leave on my desk whilst at work.	1
Latest and greatest.	1
very good	1
Wonderful product and service, I highly recommend this phone	1
I was previoulsy using and Iphone X as my company phone and got all the data for the past x years in a cloud. There was no option to retrieve those data in a phone different than an iphone!	1
Excellent phone. Came really quickly	1
Great iPhone, not learned all features yet, should last a few years	1

Good phone	1
Good delivery time and great phone.	1
Great battery life and operating speed.	1
New replacement for 5s, so happy with it	1
It was a good buy as it still had warranty and good job as I needed to take it to the apple store for a repair/clean	1
The phone was in very good condition. I really like it	1
Good buy, exactly what I expected and it’s a brand new like I just went to the apple store	1
Delighted with my new phone. Storage will never run out unlike my 5S.	1
Perfect, just what you would get from Apple	1
Just getting used to using the phone but so far very pleased I like the bigger screen and face recognition	1
No problems so far, worth the money	1
Everything went smoothly. Would recommend it.	1

A good smartphone	1
Was initially a bit wary as the price was significantly below the Apple price. Item delivered on time and brand spanking new. A great improvement on my previous 6S. I had considered buying in the USA but although with this retailer more expensive than in the USA much better than standard price in UK and it is 100% legit and no worries with customs!	1
I’m very, very impressed with the iPhone X. I always thought my 6S Plus had a great camera but, my goodness, the camera on the X is amazing!Was a little unsure whether I’d manage the Face ID and missing home button but I honest had no problem with them, right from the start. The Face ID is excellent and even works in the dark or when wearing a hat/sunglasses etc.The difference In weight to my older 6S plus is unbelievable even though the screen is slightly bigger (the bezel takes my up much of the height on the previous edition) and I find it so much easier on my wrists.Battery life is far superior than previous modes and the biggest difference, for me, aside from the much-improved camera, is the clarity and colours of the display. Everything just pops on the X.I had previously seen reviews where the camera ‘notch’ had been annoying people. I can honestly say this hasn’t been a problem for me and the only kind of ‘complaint’ I have is that some app creators haven’t updated their apps to be used on the full screen X yet so you get some having a black bar at the top and bottom. Not much of a complaint but not as aesthetically pleasing as the apps which fill the entire screen.I would thoroughly recommend this phone if you have the budget!	1
I love it and shipping was fast	1
Great phone	1
Excellent phone delivered next day.	1
I use it for my everyday activities.	1
Great product	1
Simply amazing. The best phone I’ve ever had and I’ve had a lot! I’ve always had Android before buying this and I don’t regret it. The last android phone I had was a Samsung s8+ and this blows it away!	1
i thought of doing a review on this mobile on my youtube channel .so is there any test mobile available....it will be very helpful for the amazon online purchase store	1
OMG THIS IS THE NEW IPHONE X	1
Fast service. Excellent product	1
really good screan, great service, great Wi-Fi	1
This is WebOS reborn and good riddance Home Button - after using this you won’t ever go back to such a clunky unintuitive way to do things again - WebOS was doing this in 2007 - with the X Apple has caught up at last and in doing so has left every other present (Android and iOS) offering left for dead.(Watch some YouTube videos of iPhone X and WebOS comparisons - remarkably similar - took Apple 10 years to catch up)I won’t much go over how gorgeous the hardware is - that’s evident.- I mean just look at it and handle it.I have the 64 GB silver - which is the most attractive version. The back of it glows - it’s beautiful to behold and wonderful to Handle and use - couple it with the Spigen Clear case - don’t hide the elegance and beauty - and those cases protect well using advanced materials for under £8. (In 5 years I’ve never damaged a phone when using the Spigen Clear).The screen is bigger than that of an iPhone Plus - but the handset is regular iPhone (6,7,8) sized - a tad bigger but hardly noticeable in the hand - and yes, unlike the iPhone Plus you can use this more or less one handed.The build quality is impeccable - it really is a premium device - the touch and feel - materials used -  the screen pops at you (the ‘notch’ has the cameras and is a design feature which reminds me of the bite taken out of the Apple - it differentiates your device from a common or garden Android cross breed) and the speakers are evidently louder and fuller with more range of sound and resonance than normal mobile phone speakers - so you can actually listen to music on it. (I wonder how the built in sound DSP DAC compares and fares in tests?)Battery life is the best I’ve seen on a  smartphone - a whole day of heavy use and by midnight I still had 40%.Reception and call quality again is as good as you can get.The hardware is gorgeous and coupled with the advanced internals you the have best handset on the market.But gorgeous hardware isn’t what makes a phone great - that’s the OS - and a modern OS should be user friendly, intuitive, beautiful to look at and a joy to use - it should also be fast and stable - so no annoying crashes or screen lock ups - this flies through every test and is a pleasure to use.Firstly Face ID - works more efficiently and more responsive than the finger sensor - works even in the dark and early morning with curtains shut and face screwed up - also effortlessly works with the browser, App Store purchases and other apps - and most apps have been updated to use this plus the gestures and screen of this iPhone X.The OS is a killer - the removal of the home button is a massive plus feature which turns a clunky device into magic - leaving any half baked  Android offering eating dust.iOS 11 on the iPhone X is WebOS 2017 - to think that Palm was so far ahead of its time - it built the most elegant and intuitive mobile phone OS back in the noughties - it’s give or take what the experience on the iPhone X is today.The iPhone X is beautiful to use intuitive  gesture based card system more of less as was WebOS - switching apps? Swipe across the bottom - closing apps? Gently touch and Swipe a card up  - switch apps? Swipe up and select the cards - and it multitasks properly - the camera and YouTube will run in card form (as on the WebOS TouchPad and Pre 3) - using every part of the screen to good effect - swipe from top right - from top or bottom reveals other features - and all fast responsive and with not a single crash or screen lock up in sight.I always hated the home button - coming from WebOS and HP Touchpad the iOS of the day was clunky and unintuitive - I noticed over the years how the iOS versions slowly morphed into what WebOS was - the morphing is complete with the dropping of the Hone Button and an adoption of an elegant intuitive card gesture based system which is a pleasure to use - the iPhone X is the best handset in the market and with the new iOS version it’s clearly the most beautiful intuitive elegant and user friendly - most stable and effortless OS on the market.A winner - thank you Apple and thank you Palm WebOS.	1
• BLACKS: blacks look properly black. Unlike LCD, they don't even light up the pixel.• HOME BUTTON GONE: you have to swipe up instead. I like this because it goes straight to the home screen, because while you're doing it, Face ID unlocks the phone in the background.• TO SWITCH APPS: just keep your finger on the screen after you swipe up. You get a subtle haptic feedback and then you get the apps presented to you as ""cards"".• NOTCH: It's actually tiny, and you really do stop noticing it.• CAMERA: optical stabilisation now also works on the telephone lens. It's superb.Overall, the phone is such a delight, you overlook the minor shortcomings:• COLOUR SHIFT: the whites seem blue-ish when you tilt the phone a bit. (Very slightly.)For people who are stuck in their ways: just get the iPhone 8. It has almost the same technology and you get to keep the home button. The iPhone 8 is still a great phone!• PRICE: It's very nice but i feel it's overpriced at £999 [Do not pay over £999 for the base model! I note that on this page they are taking the piss!]UPDATE 2018.05.02================• FaceID is a nice effort, but in my opinion nothing beats Touch ID 2 (as found on the iPhone 6 / 7/ 8).• I get that there's no room for Apple to put the TouchID sensor, due to reduced bezels.• It's annoying that the gestures are not now consistent between iPhone X vs iPad (& iPhone 7/8/SE)	1
IMPORTANT! SELLER WAS: KOOKcommunicationSeller is excellent! I live in Belgium (europe) and therefore there were some things about the iphone ( it is a korean model, watch out for that) that dind't work as I wanted. Asian country's have a privacy law that states the shutter camera sound should always be on, that bothered my too much. But don't get me wrong! The iPhone was in perfect condition, everything in the original box and everything worked. U can perfectly use it in europe or elsewhere, i's just things like the shutter sound, if you're not bothered by it it's perfectly usable! The seller immediately offered a full refund and it's already on it's way back to the seller, perfect customer service!	1
Went for this over the new iPhone XS. Decided to not go with a contract so paid upfront. Feels solid in the hand, bigger and slightly heavier than my previous iPhone 8. Feel premium and butter smooth to operate. Face ID is quick and I don't miss the fingerprint mechanism a bit. Feels like you look at an app and it just opens. Can easily get a days worth screentime, as I am not a heavy phone user. Mainly for conference calls on Skype at work for which I use my phone and wireless earphones. Love with the display. It is just brilliant. Not overdone like the Samsung galaxy s9 my wife owns where it starts to feel unreal. Also pairs well with my Macbook Air as I have had both these devices since 2011, so couldn't really come out of the Apple eco system. All in all a good buy!	1
I love it. Yes, it is pricey but it is an iPod, camera and photo album as well as phone all in one. Well, had to justify it to myself. But I do love it and it can do loads of clever stuff.....I keep discovering more...wowDo watch YouTube clips to work out how to save on using up data.....used loads at the start but now know how to turn off different modes and save data......a great learning tool too😊	1
Very good phone upgraded from the iPhone 7 though the iPhone 7 is an extremely good versatile phone this is better in many ways although I was quite happy with my iPhone 7 it’s better for me because I had the 7+ and this is slightly smaller overall but slightly bigger screen seems a little bit faster and better touchscreen I would never buy android phone Ollie know if you can afford it then in my view I products are far superior to android in terms of reliability security and ease-of-use do I think it’s overpriced? Probably a little bit with all the crappy Chinese handsets out there do you really want to be hacked plus secondhand market is very attractive for an iPhone	1
This phone was bought as a Christmas present for my daughter. No problem in transferring data from her 6s, I would say that Apple are easily the best phone on the market, but as all Apple products expensive, but that’s life	1
I love this phone! It is a good step up from the IPhone SE which I had before. The screen and battery life are much better, facial recognition works real well and the camera is great - I love the profile setting which blurs our the background. The new headphone jack is a bit annoying, you have to use the apple headphones or Bluetooth ones, and you can’t charge the phone at the same time as listening via the wired headphones as they use the same jack. It is expensive but overall I would recommend it!	1
this is just fantastic it is so good its unreal my mac book is now redundant this does it all and so fast good price now forget the xs normal no point upgrade this phone is good for a few years yet cant fault it.love apple	1
I hate Iphones, but my mum loves them. Bought this for her arrived within 3 days to replace my mum's broken phone. She loves it and has been continually thanking me since 20th Dec 2018. So great seller and good product (still not worth the money IMO).	1
Amazing product, let down by a huge scratch on the screen and button sticking but that is to be expected from a second hand phone.	1
What can I say that hasn't been said before, it's an Apple phone	1
This was bought as a gift. After a few teething problems it is now favourite.	1
Good phone, keep working on the battery please	1
Very good original fast delivery	1

Amazing phone, best iPhone ever, highly recommend!	1
So re how good is iPhone Ten... When I’d bought it, I was a bit hesitating about it when people asked me. I thought maybe I’d wasted my money a little.And I will say that I think that the only *dramatic* advantage is the size. A large screen on a much smaller phone than previously. I love that.But also, since then I’ve noticed things in comparison with my iPhone 6S+. It is actually quite noticeable improvements.One of them is the speaker. It is good enough to use to listen to podcasts and audiobooks when needed. On the 6, the bass is much more noisy, so male voices do not sound great at all, quite grating.Another, which I’d not seen coming, is the glass surface. I wonder how they have done it, but there must be some new treatment, because it is way less receptive to finger prints. I barely ever need to wipe it, it’s great. I wish my iPads had that surface.(I also wish all the devices had better anti-reflection coating, why don’t they?)Also, the colors and contrast of the screen are amazing. When the phone restarts in a dark room, I can cover the white Apple logo, and the black background is not visible!Also the camera is improved even beyond the addition of a “tele” camera (actually it’s a Normal lens, the old one is a clear wide-angle).  The only A/B test I’ve made is night-time video, but the X blew the 6 out of the water there.None of these are must-have for most people, but it is clear that a lot of work goes into improving everything on the phones, and I think goes a ways to justify the admittedly high price for the X.And as a side-note, I have no doubt that as a business tactic, the high price is the right thing for Apple. They have to position it as a premium product, and it would not seem so if it cost only the same as the previous phone.	1
Firstly, great service from the seller. Dispatched straight away and arrived the next day.The phone came just as described (purchased second hand) works perfectly, couldn't be happier.My previous phone was an iPhone 6, compared to the Iphone X is like night and day. Especially when playing games or apps that demand a high processing power. Awesome phone.	1
PLEASE READ for the small minority a guy on Snapchat called mhdiscounts will say he can get you discounts on anything from on amazon including iPhones DO NOT believe him it is a scam which me and my cousin have fell victim to	1
David likes new phone but his other phone gone broke so David have to order his new one and David have get my song back and his own song back and David know the words to my song well in chores iv told him how do you know the words and David gone frown at me for reason sing this time baby ill be bulletproof	1
Hi there,Would u allow me to test an iPhone X for my YouTube video ?	1
Excellent	1
You think the price is high but what you get is worth every penny!!!!! The pictures are better than 35mm camera with zoom lensThe X model looses the Home Button and doesn’t have a the headphone jack like the 7’s. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.If you can afford it, you will be happy.The Face ID works really well. This is the first of what will be new technologies for Apple like the Face ID, this was probably rushed and the next version will be more secure and work better. But it seems to work fine right now and does take the place of the finger ID pretty well.Camera takes awesome pictures.Pleased so far and looks like a solid reliable phone. The main thing I like is the larger screen which is gorgeous and the faster processor. I love the phone but honestly I could have waited a year for the next model. If you can afford it now you’ll enjoy it. The size is perfect for me and the screen is awesome.Get a good case to protect it with which also hide the gorgeous design. I never really saw the iPhone 7 in black that I had because I always had it in a heavy duty case to protect it. It’s a shame to hide such great looking devices but you kinda have to so they don’t get dinged up.	1
I always wanted an iPhone X as upgrade from iPhone 7 and this one did perfect.  Really liked the display and design of this iPhone.  Bigger than the one I had and a better camera.	1
I was initially a bit wary of buying it through Amazon as I didn't know Apple would sell their products outside of their own website and cheaper, unless it was a phone company such as Vodafone or Three. I got my phone back in February, everything ok, delivered in time and actually Apple so very happy with it as it is cheaper than on their own website. From now on I will probably buy it on Amazon if the price difference persists.	1
Cheaper than that available from apple - quick delivery of genuine new iPhone 8 - spot on 	1
Replaced my Sony Xperia XA1 with this and I won’t look back. I loved the Apple ecosystem from the MacBook and Handoff is a very useful feature. The integration of iOS and macOS is hard to match.The battery life seems to be less than the iPhone 7 which I also purchased so I had to keep charging it in at least half a day with how much I use it. It’s not a huge deal as I got a power bank too. But it’s a bit annoying.Performance by the bionic A11 chip is amazing. I don’t play mobile games but everything I opened and closed felt like butter. It can handle all the apps I open and more without a stutter, so performance isn’t anything to sneeze at. Mobile gamers might have a different experience but the specs are rocking.The other requirements of the phone are for heavier phone users, but it ought to be fine. I use the iPhone XR now and FaceID feels better and smoother, more intuitive, but the TouchID is still excellent as used on my iPad.	1
The duration of battery is ideal and you can play a whole day, but there are no other differences between iPhone 8 and iPhone 6s	1
A lot of people already know that iPhones are great. I chose this one because the upgrade differences we just up on my 6 - but not up enough to pay a full price for a X? Arrived very quickly - all safe & sound 😀 Although did choose Amazon to buy it through just in case we had any problems, and needed to claim anything back? But no need to have worried.	1
Great price (much lower than apple/john lewis etc). Genuine, works like a charm. I came to this from android and am definitely very very pleased! Good battery life, takes great photos, synchs across all apple platforms seamlessly, loving apple pay. Very pleased	1
Changed from android , first week of test he passed very well , the only minus i think is battery , all the rest is amazing. The price for sure is worth the quality!	1
Excellent preowned mobile will recommend to all my family and friends!!!	1
I took my time to change from my iPhone 5s to the 8 (I am a tight git and didn't like the prices). I am pleased with the phone, on my 5 the touchid didn't really work, on the 8 it is much better but recently it seems to have been slightly temperamental.	1
Arrived very fast, perfect box perfect phone, upgraded from Iphone 6s to Iphone 8, huge difference !! Battery feels way better, phone is lightning quick and can get so much more done on this handset.	1
Its a decent product with an elegant design.	1
Hope with it	1

Met my expectations	1
Great phone no complaints	1
Happy with it	1
Work	1
Perfect working condition, good as new	1
Very happy with this and thought it was a bargain at £612 instead of £699 on apples website. The only thing I would say is that it took a long time to first turn on (about 20 mins) as the battery was completely dead. I’m presuming this is because it’s been sat in a warehouse for a long time. No issues with it now, it’s a great phone. Also was delivered about 5 days quicker than the estimated delivery.	1
Fabulous phone fast, clear and easy to use and set up.  Battery lasts all day to 😊	1
Arrived much quicker than stated, wife loves her new phone and loves the colourThanks for a great service will be looking to replace my phone will contact your company when ready5☆	1
Very happy with my phone,	1
it is good and I fully satisfied my expectation.	1
Excellent	1
Great phone. Really fast and great battery life thanks to low power use of processor.  Just make sure you get a decent case as front and rear glass replacement is very exspensivd if damaged	1
Bought this iPhone 8 for my daughter, she loves the excellent quality photos it takes, going from an iPhone 4 to an 8 is a huge step, but well worth it and I reckon bought at a bargain price too	1
One of the best purchases I've made in my life. So happy I did not go for the X	1
This phone is exactly what I want in a mobile phone 😊	1
Very happy thank you	1
Quality product, iPhones are overpriced for what they can do compared to android models today but if your looking for a premium iPhone then this seller will provide one!	1
Excellent phone!	1
Bought this phone on Amazon marketplace from TechAmaze. £100 cheaper than most shops for the same item.Came in original packing, sealed, unlocked.Love it. 5 Stars	1
Bought from Amazon Warehouse. Described as Good Condition so was a bit wary what it might look like.  It arrived in it's own box with charger and head phones. It is like NEW condition. I can't see anything wrong with it. Perhaps packaging had been opened previously. Much cheaper than buying new. Very pleased with it.Upgraded from iphone 5 to this iphone 8 and there's a big difference. Good sized screen. Nice, slim body.  Great features. Very easy to move sim card from old to new phone and instant set-up with all my contacts, history etc.Delighted with this phone.	1
Iphone 8 as expected from the reviews -Fantastic seller -smart tech are absolutely great and very helpful	1
Lovely phone good price from Amazon, who are now an official Apple retailer, otherwise I would not have bought it from them. It does what you expect it to do.	1
firstly the new mobile cloned my old mobile (strange in my mind)  and not actually using it in full the battery life appears to be less than my original well used mobile (earlier version of 8)	1
Yet another great iphone. Takes very good pictures, has nice design. Battery life is way better than it was in iphone 6s I used to have before it	1
I thought it was a little expensive as it wasn't the newest model.  But other than that it was pefect and brand new.  I was wondered how to insure it against theft..	1
I only use it for general UK calls, not overseas calls. It works well and, in its case, fits comfortably in my trouser pocket. Larger models would not have fitted so well. The camera is much better than that on my previous 5s model	1
I'm not an apple lady but my teen is and she is very happy with the phone.	1
Just what I wanted, very pleased with it.	1
Same size, but much improved.	1
fast delivery great item as described	1
good	1
Really good iPhone, swapped from a 6s so it’s very familiar but better	1
I’m very pleased with my phone. I have the rose gold 8. It arrived earlier than expected and it was brand new and unopened. After a couple months I noticed there was a tiny dot moving around on my camera lense and I ended up having the camera replaced at the Apple store. This was covered by the warranty so I wasn’t charged at all. The seller was in contact with me during the whole process and checking that everything was alright. I have had no other problems with this phone.	1
PROS:1: FAST, Smooth operating system.2: Stylish Glass Back & Wireless Charging.3: Fantastic Front & Rear Camera.4: The NEW Vibrating Button Design feels great under your finger ... ( & i really didn't think id like the new design idea but i love it )5: Waterproof.CONS:1: NoneI'm not a fan of Face iD Recognition or the design of the iPhone X, so i bought the best apple iPhone on the market that still uses the touch iD technology & this is it.	1
Very impressed with the screen size and its clarity. I've just upgraded from the 5s to this 8 and I'm really pleased I did. Fantastic phone with lots of extra features. Also very impressed by the battery life and speed of charging. Battery lasts much longer than my old phone that I was needing to charge st least every other day. This lasts me around 3-4 days depending on how much I use it and will fully charge from around 15% to 100% in around 2 1/2 hours.  Also much cheaper, by hundreds of pounds, to buy outright than have it on a contract, especially as I always forget to cancel at the right time and end up over paying for 6 months or so.  If you can't afford it outright, see if you can get an interest free credit card and pay it off in the free months, that's if you're disciplined enough not to spend on it, lol.	1
its an IPhone...and its great...nothing more to add	1
Great value. Great service.	1
Excellent	1
Its an iPhone 8, what else can I say	1
fast delivery phone new and as it should be very happy thanks	1
Brilliant!!	1
Its just like your old iPhone but faster and it does more stuff. You’re clearly going to buy one, so stop worrying about whether you can afford it, and just click the button.	1
Having used this phone now for almost 2 months I can say it's superb.  The only downside appears to be the speed at which the battery loses its power.  Also if purchasing the excellent Caseology iphone case, be sure not to accidentally push down the mute button on the side.  Basically, this is no longer a phone, it is a miniature computer/ipad.  The 'Touch ID' facility is amazing and allows me to access my Nat West account within seconds and move money around.  It is without doubt an amazing piece of kit.  Buy the Caseology case for it to show it off at its best.	1
Quick delivery.  The produt is as described.	1
Brilliant	1
Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It's an early Christmas present to replace a smashed iPhone 6 and the iPhone 8 has some useful new features. The gold colour looks pretty good too!	1
About the phone, I would say that changing from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone 8 is totally worth it. From the camera to the performance, you can absolutely tell the difference.About the seller, I bought my iPhone 8 from A-Mountain, and I admit that I had many doubts, but after all I cannot complain. At the beginning it was said they didn’t have stock, but the day after it changed and was delivered. Then my package arrived on time and everything was okay. I asked for the invoice and got it very fast as well. It’s an original new iPhone, working well, and at a very good price. I recommend!	1
hey i would like an iphon my insa is lough	1
Better value for money than the marginally higher spec models.	1
Ideal	1
It’s a new iPhone so it does what new iPhones do. Always expensive and go out of date too quickly. Great phone though.	1
I needed to renew my phone so chose this one.  I amNot disappointed	1
Received my new iPhone 8 Plus yesterday, and I can honestly say it’s fantastic! It’s really fast compared to my old iPhone, which was the reason for changing. It came the day after I ordered it, which was a nice surprise. I can’t fault anything about the phone or the service I received, so I’d highly recommend anyone to buy one.! :-)	1
Great phone as predicted. Simple upgrade from an iPhone 6, so very familiar with the OS.	1
I was reluctant to get a smartphone, thinking they were all hype, so I resisted til a year ago. Its hard to live without now. Does everything quickly and conveniently. The cam can record in 4k 60fps. The glass on the back feels amazing in the hand, like very high quality. Takes great pics. It does everything you're likely to need. Phones sure have come a long way.	1
Excellent phone looks like brand new, not a scratch to be seen and arrived before expected. I would highly recommend this seller	1
Love it I thought it might be too big as I upgraded from an SE but it’s perfect. Camera is terrific and the sound is great. I like the finger print reader not ready for the facial recognition stuff of the iPhone X just yet	1
Excellent buy	1
The price fitted my pocket...	1
lovely phone	1
Easy to use with a great screen but make sure you buy a protective screen surround in case you drop it...	1
Amazing had for 2 years and now I’m perfect condition	1
Excellent people to buy from, will definitely buy from these again, phone is excellent, couldn’t be happier 🏻😊	1
Really love this and was sent out in time. Thank you so much. Genuine iPhone 8plus	1
Perfect apple product	1
Great phone ,no scratches	1
Camera quality is better than the iPhone XS Max. Doesn’t scratch easily despite having a glass back. Overall a solid phone.	1
Brilliant condition really happy with it	1

Best value for money ever	1
all good	1

Fantastic iPhone 8 a plus came before time	1
Oops, I thought I was writing about the screen shield: This is a backup phone I bought but I haven’t yet tried it as I am waiting for my SIM to arrive. Nevertheless my main phone is also an iPhone 8 plus and I can say I immediately fell in love with it. This is the best Apple product I had in my hand in years. For those wearing hearing aids, you can pair them to the phone and use the phone as a hearing aid by placing it some where in a room when you would normally struggle to hear. I have been told the advance for the sight disabilities are equally impressive. This is absolutely a brilliant phone.	1
I purchased my iPhone 8 plus on release day 2017 upgrading from a normal iPhone 7. Visually there is little difference between the iPhone 7 generation + the iPhone 8 generation however don't let this put you off. The display visual does seem a little bit better then previous generation and so does the camera. The battery life is by far a lot better then my iPhone 7 ever was, coming on a year and 3 months old my phone still lasts a day and a half with normal use .e.g. texts, phone calls, using as torch and photos however using my phone looking at social media or videos and music this is lowered to about a days worth of charge, however this still beats all previous generation battery life especial at the age it is now when that usually starts to drop. I personally have made the decision not to upgrade from this for the foreseeable future as it does exactly what I require of it and the camera is very good and the storage capacity is excellent. My conclusion on this phone is mixed however the reason for this is if you have a iPhone 6 or older then I would recommend the upgrade to the 8, however if you have the iPhone 7 I recommend skipping this generation as there is not enough change to justify upgrading to this. Now I get to the point why should or would people buy the iPhone 8 when they can get the 2018 models well the truth is a phone is a phone for its age this is very advance and this also comes with a lot smaller price tag so if you are not someone who needs to have all the latest gadgets I would recommend buying this generation for the time being.	1
Delivery on point, it actually came before expected which was great. The phone itself it fantastic, no marks at all basically brand new and comes with charger and headphones which is a bonus! Deffo recommend this item. Happy customer :)	1
Great phone. I can't say I agree about the refurb comment - there's no sign of it being ""not new"" and the battery and screen is incredible. Overall a good purchase.	1
Phone arrived very quickly, quicker than expected. Overall amazing device, blazing fast, all day battery life, great upgrade from an iPhone SE!	1
Lovely but slippery	1
Simply Best	1
The best phone	1
iPhone arrived on time and was as advertised. The phone is an upgrade from my old iPhone 6S Plus & the difference in performance is very noticeable. Very happy with my purchase.......	1

Great phone. Really pleased with it. Had it some months now and everything is brilliant. Great service too. Highly recommend.	1
Item was exactly as described. Liked the fact that the earphones were untouched and everything was as new. One very happy granddaughter.	1
This is a beautiful phone. The seller was extremely helpful before and after the purchase of the iPhone 8 Plus.I highly recommend!	1
All as described and arrived on time	1
Very good phone. Can't fault it.	1

Great purchase for my wife, and she loves the phone +++++++++	1
The most powerful phone I’ve ever had. I was looking to ipgrade from my 7 non-Plus because I couldn’t bare woth the relatively small display (4.7 inch) any more and after a long research, this will be my phone for the next at least 5 years.I was comparing to the X and to what’s going to be released this September as well and it won for me by a long shot.It has a 16:9 display, the natural resolution of YouTube. The X and the new ones are 19:9 and videos in YouTube are a little zoomed which is annoying. Also, it has the most beautiful LCD I’ve seen on a phone. The OLED on the new ones is a no for me because of the chance it has to get burn marks. Also, its wider display is awesome for my big hands. Its screen is 5,5 inch while the X is 5,8 but you see way more conent on the 8 Plus.Second, the Touch ID. Much faster and accurate than Face ID at the moment. Face ID is the future but in my opinion it’s currently in a beta state.Third, moving away from the differences between this and the new ones, is its battery. I get absolutely INCREDIBLE battery. It’s no way compared to my 7. I tinkered my settings after watching various YouTube videos and I LOVE my battery time. Easily 3 days with moderate use.Fourth, the camera. Oh god what a camera. Again, nothing like my 7’s. Crisp clear and the portrait mode is AWESOME. With some tips I’ve seen on the internet about taking photos, my photos look like professional ones now.Lastly, compared to androids, the fact that I get updates, both OS ones and security ones, instantly is a huge plus. With android phones, if you don’t own a Google Pixel phone, you must wait in line to get any updates, and the wait time is longer depending on the manufacturer. Also, owning a variety of Apple and Android phones, I’ve found out that my Apple phones last WAY longer than android ones. My 5S for example is still blazing fast. Apple does care about their old phones. You can see that woth iOS 12 coming out and boosting the performance of the old phones by a HUGE.	1
I’ve been using android and pretty much nothing else but since 2010. So I’d just like to say that if your thinking of making the switch, do it.The iPhone 8 Plus is an expensive way to start, but the one thing I didn’t want to do was downsize my screen. Coming from a huawei p10 Plus I was used to a very quick phone. The 8 Plus is just as quick through general navigation and use I’d say, but blows gaming away with not only the A11 chip but just how well games are optimised on iOS. The device oozes quality but I will say you definitely want to look after it. A good case is a must as well as a decent screen protector (plenty of both on Amazon).What’s it like as a phone? Calls are great. Very clear calls every time. Texting? This was an annoyance for me on android because even third party keyboards for me are not as good as the stock iOS keyboard. I can confidently type with my eyes closed now and mistakes are very few and far between.The camera(s)? The dual 12mp setup on the Plus is more than capable of taking brilliant snaps worthy of printing and sharing. I can’t tell if it’s down to the true tone display or the camera but pics do appear a little on the warm side. Nowhere near as harsh as the likes of a galaxy s9 though.Making the switch... Android is a great mobile OS for a lot of reasons. However here’s my reasons for now preferring iOS:>The layout. I love the clean straightforward look of iOS. Sure android is more versatile in this field, but I always found I could never settle on the same look for very long. I just don’t notice this anymore.>No repeated or needless apps, I got so used to being forced to have multiple keyboards media players message apps and gallery’s it became senseless having stock android and then the manufacturer apps together. No need for launchers or anything 3rd party anymore. I think the system apps are just that good.>Freedom to uninstall. On my device almost every app bar the core apps can be uninstalled at the tap of a finger. Another major of annoyance of android, it’s great having multifunction devices but not when your bogged down with so many you don’t even use.>Amazing battery life from iOS now. It’s a fact that iOS used to suffer from poor battery but I just cannot wear this phone out. Even games don’t drain the battery by very much, I am very impressed.	1
Great mobile love it ....	1
So happy that I purchased this phone. For someone who has had androids for the past 2/3 years. Changing to an apple product has been the easiest transformation! Customer service from TechAmaze has been amazing (pun intended)! Everytime I had a query about the phone they were there everytime with a smooth answer to keep me at ease! Thank you for being easy to shop from!	1

If you have owned I iPhone before you know exactly what you are getting. Easy to use with plenty of features and great looks. Might I add that the new glass back makes this phone look sleeker than ever	1
Had come to the crossroads with my iphone 5, the battery was limping along and time to renew, I am very happy with the choice I made, I love the larger screen and with it on zoom it is so much easier to navigate (good for ageing eyes). I opted for 256GB to somewhat future proof, very happy, thank you.	1
The iPhone 7 is a very good phone as verified by outfits like Which. This supplier delivered in a very short time at a competitive price and it arrived in good order	1
I am very happy that I bought this phone even though I was quite hesitant before about the low price and chances of it being a refurbished one or one with few damages. But a brand new iPhone7 for this price was obviously a better bet than buying in any other retail outlets or the apple store itself!	1
I have a PhD in computing and so far I opened this phone and found nothing wrong. The lcd(display) works fine and has no scratches, battery health came at an acceptable rate, it’s 12MP back câmera is absolutely stunning and the 7MP face camera is very cool. I would definetly recomendo you buy this!	1
I wanted to go for a light-weight small iPhone again after getting the XS. The 7 is the lightest, smallest and well-supported (wrt iOS updates) that I could find. It does the job.The phone was delivered in one day during the busy Christmas period. I was desperate for it as I was travelling at this time. Almost 2 months now, and it works perfectly, no problems at all. As with small iPhones (and smartphones) the battery doesn't last long if you're running heavy workloads like Fortnite, etc.	1
Can hardly tell this is a refurb phoneDaughter is so chuffed thankyou	1
Trust is important. It was a phone for my teenage daughter and no complaints from her - This Seller accurately described the item and delivered it on time and what else can I say!!	1

nice looking	1
Bought this for my niece and she's delighted with it. It more than meets her expectations and the 256 GB WILL be needed for all the creative things she's able to use the phone for that she never realised she could do with it. She's at college doing an Animation Course so is able to do some of her work on the phone. Her iPad packed in and this phone ""almost"" replaces that for many things, so it's not just being used as a phone and it's NOT for random Selfies!!!Unlikely that most folk would need 256 GB, but smaller memories available cheaper. I could not find the 256 GB version elsewhere, but this seemed a very good price compared to elsewhere for iPhone 7s with less memory.Whether this is the right phone for you, depends on your needs, so do your homework first to get the right model or it could be an expensive mistake.I'm glad I chose this iPhone 7 with the huge 256 GB memory for her and was happy with the price. It arrived promptly, no problems and I was happy with the seller. If this is for you, I would recommend 	1
Just needed an upgrade on a new iPhone not a fan of the iPhone x because of the problems it has and no point in getting a iPhone 8 plus because of the phone back being made of glass if the back of the phone gets shattered apple will not fix it just like they won’t fix the iPhone x if the back gets shattered on that and i am not a fan of overly big phones so was not going for the iPhone 7 Plus because i like to have a phone that will fit in my pocket so I went for the iPhone 7 i love the home button on this phone it doesn’t have the same clicking as it does on older iPhones it just simulates the feel of the home button by vibrations which I really like great phone nice and comfortable to hold	1
After searching for a sim free iPhone 7 for a few weeks, I can across this deal on Amazon. The quoted price was fantastic and even paying a bit more for express delivery, I was still making a significant saving for the phone spec I wanted. Ordered on a Wednesday evening, received acknowledgment of the order nearly immediately. Then received a despatch notice on Thursday to say the phone would be with me on Friday morning with the specific time frame window given. Delivery came as specified and if I could give three thumbs up, I would. Keep up the good work.	1
I’ve converted from android and could not be happier should have done it sooner. I purchased a new silver 256gb iPhone sim free, it was so easy to pop into o2 to change the sim for an iPhone up and running within minutes. Seller was very quick to send by courier arrived within a couple of days in time for concert and was able to get some great sounding video.	1
Just as described. The phone is in excellent condition, unlocked and works perfectly. Can hardly tell it's been used.	1
Great phone	1
Perfect phone. Packaged well.	1
I don't want any other phone now! This is everything I need! Conected with macbook is awesome!	1
I was very happy with this purchase, the phone did come with few scratches but clearly from usage and barely noticeable. I received an email saying that my phone would be delivered on a later date than scheduled, it actually arrived on the day after the email about the delay, which was brilliant! I do recommend this seller!	1
I bought this for my wife. Considering that there are millions of reviews on the iPhone 7 and owning one myself, I don't think there is a need to review the product. The quality, packaging and delivery from the seller was excellent. No problems with the device so far and a real happy wife at home. Thanks	1
So happy with the phone! Arrived quickly.	1
Great price for unlocked phone	1
Item as described, good price, prompt and secure delivery.	1

Good product, great service.	1
Quick delivery nice phone	1
It was what I expect.	1
Even if I do buy stuff quite regularly on Amazon, I wasn't very keen on buying something so expensive. In the end I went for it, and I'm very glad I did. Great buy, excellent product, first class service. I would definitely buy again from this seller, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone....	1
Excellent Phone.  I don't need to tell people about the features of this, Apple know what there doing with the IPhone franchise.Looks Sleek, Easy to Use, Hold Charge Well and Functions are brilliant.  I use this for work and home can not fault it.	1
All good	1
Very decent and just people I will recommend and nothing changes thanks again	1
Had this iPhone in silver got it in 2017 and it worked perfectly until may of 2019 when the battery has started to die quickly the s8 has better battery life than the iphone	1
I am happy	1
Great stuff	1
Apple did it again!!!! Hats of people!!! It's the best phone on the market, I used to have Samsung s7 but no android is as intuitive as this iPhone. Camera is surprisingly clear and crisp. Interface is fast like Sheldon Cooper after coffee :) amazing attention to the detail made this bad boy not only beautiful but silky smooth to the touch to. What a phone?!? Is it expensive? Yes it is but as we all know if we won't pay the price we are left with sloppy seconds. It's worth the money!!!	1
I'm quite impressed and satisfied as I've passed on my IPhone 6 to my son.This is sim free so will pay for itself over 12 months	1
Very happy with this product. I wasn't convinced whether or not I should buy it from the Apple Store, but I made the right choice. No a single problem so far	1
Excellent	1
Perfect!	1
Bought this phone fromMusicmagpie fantastic company to deal with . Would recommend to anyone	1

good!	1
Greay	1
Love this item	1
Having had the iPhone 5 and 6 both in muted colours I decided to be more girly with the rose gold, a bit disappointed that it is more pink in colour. Sound is much better with the dual speakers at the bottom and the camera seems much better than the 6 although I am no expert photos appear to have more clarity and battery life is really good.	1
Good	1
Good	1
Instead of the iPhone 6S, with just a 3D Touch screen in the way of new features and a few power boosts here and there, we'd have had a waterproof handset with dual speakers, a brighter and more colorful screen and a boosted 12MP camera that took better pictures than the one on the iPhone 6.Changing the home button from a clickable entity to something that responds to pressure – and possibly even the loss of the headphone jack – would have been seen as innovative and alternative in a sea of identikit handsets.And if Apple had thrown in the new Jet Black finish with a top-end 256GB storage model… well, that would have been a real challenger, a chance for the brand to cast off the 'tick-tock' mentality of keeping the smaller upgrades confined to the S variants, and remind us that it just makes great phones.	1
thank u	1
I am really impressed with the iPhone 7. The new phone is really zippy and fast at what it does. The best feature me personally is the waterproofing. I think this is a great move by Apple, its a real shame there is no wireless as most phones today have this feature.Now i owned a iPhone 4, 5s, and 6, so this was an obvious upgrade. I know many people say its a 6s but yes your right it looks like a 6s, and that's where it ends. Hardware is upgraded and camera and IOS10 is brilliant there is a few features that i like more on IOS9. But hey ho. It works wonderfully.As for the whole no headphone jack i am really not bothered and has made no difference to me. You get a little connector so you use that. I tend to use bluetooth with my speaker. So again has not been an issue.I have noticed a difference in battery life. not ground breaking. but its about tweaking the settings and you can get a good 2 days life of heavy use i do. The box it comes in is a nice and posh box.The headphones though the little connector are the same as the other ones. So the connector makes no difference. So overall if your a die hard Apple fan then its a must.I look forward to the Anniversary Edition next will look. But this is certainly a good phone. And well recommended. I cant really find much negatives. I suppose the battery life could of been better. As they made so much its going to have a bigger battery because there is no headphone.So lastly if your iPhone 5s or 6 owner its an obvious upgrade. But if you have 6s owner then maybe not really benefiting only the waterproofing.Comment |	1
Arrived very quickly and as specified. Delighted with the product.	1
I got fed up with my Lumia 650 losing Wi-Fi, being generally sluggish and (okay, I know it sounds a bit weak...) the Facebook never working properly. I gave Microsoft many months to sort Windows 10 mobile out but they haven't, and I somehow suspect they can't, despite being the world's largest software company.So I bit the bullet. I bought an iPhone 7 (32gb) - not from Amazon, unusually for me, because so far their pricing isn't good. I'm sure it will be - so Carphone Warehouse got my money.The phone is a revelation to me. Everything works so well, I'd forgotten what ""works"" means regarding mobile phones. Apps open instantly, the internet never fails and pages load almost magically quickly. The phone and the whole experience feels a million dollars (as it should at the price!), and - despite what the other reviewer says - 32gb seems plenty to me for my general kind of usage. If you were downloading movies and songs, taking lots of videos then I expect the 128gb version would be a sensible buy. I doubt I'll ever regret saving myself another £100.00 on top of an already obscene amount for what - a phone! Okay - it's vastly more than a phone!! It's easy to move photos to your PC now and again if space becomes limited, and MP3s really don't take up that much space. I think the 32gb version would suit many users - if you have the money!It's a stunning piece of kit. Well done Apple. To criticise the screen resolution by comparing it to a Samsung might technically be fair, but practically, this screen looks amazing. The colours are brilliant and the sharpness is as much as the eye can make out so far as I can see. Also, my last android phone left me in despair with so many updates and fiddling around. I came to the conclusion that android was a phone system designed by computer geeks and not made for people who  want simplicity. The iPhone is made for easy usage and does all  that could be imagined in a mobile phone.	1
good deal	1
i love u	1
Great device	1
NA	1
Literally as new. Unused headphones, proper official charger, perfectly boxed. Not a scratch on the thing and everything works as it should. Well impressed for what I paid. Arrived the next day as stated. Highly recommended!	1
Amazing upgrade compared to my 5C. Camera quality is outstanding and matte black finish is great. Only cons, battery life could be improved and diminishes significantly faster in hotter conditions. Also still getting used to lack of headphone jack.	1
Phone was as new and still had 6 month warrantee on it	1
Upgraded from an iPhone 4 - what a difference. What can you say - it's an Apple	1
Great phone, very happy so far!	1

Nothing bad to say but I loved apple products for years	1
Product arrived on time and at very high quality. Their correspondence was also very quick and efficient.	1
A second hand iPhone 7 but you could barely guess it was. Slight bit of wear around the edges but regardless of that, it's close to looking immaculate. No faults, no glitches...overall an excellent purchase.......for now that is......?	1
excellent	1
Brilliant, fast, rock solid software performance, outstanding battery life.	1
Item arrived as expected. Setting up was hassle free and moving data from one phone to another was as easy and 1-2-3. Great phone that will hopefully last me a while. Price a little steep but what can be done about that?!	1
Love the phone! I purchased with Amazon as the supplier for slightly more security, worth spending the few extra pounds.Have used multiple SIM cards in it already with no issues.Jet Black is beautiful, but will scratch and smudges very easily, so you'll need a case. The camera is great and really produces some top end pics. Delighted with battery life, giving me full day of usage with around 20-30% left at night most days.Worth spending the extra bit for 128gb, some of the newer apps etc take up plenty space and you don't want to have the issue 1 year down the line of needing to clear memory.	1
Brand new iPhone 7 .very happy with deal.	1
nice looking phone which does everything	1
it working well, this is the important thing for this kind of order	1
worth it. thanks	1
As a several years’ iPhone user, a washing machine-related mishap with my 5s led me to upgrade to the new 4G iPhone 7.The regular 7 is the ideal size to fit your pocket and very lightweight, but a larger version of the phone is available for avid gamers who like a bigger screen and which has more camera functions too, with a £100 price premium.The main takeaways:1. The iPhone design as ever is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use. The 7’s case-colours are subtle and classy-looking with black, grey and metallic pastels endowing the phone with a quality image2. The screen is a big leap forward from the 6, with clear bright graphics and allowing you to choose icon and text size (perfect for those of us whose vision isn’t quite as sharp as it used to be). The regular 7 seems to have finally got the balance right between a good usable screen size and convenient portability3. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, using the phone in landscape format has the effect of widening the keypad4. The ring tone & speaker volume is clearer & louder on the iPhone 7 than any of its rivals5. The new cordless airpods sense when they’re in your ears and pause when you remove them, so finally an end to earphones with trailing cables6. The iPhone 7 is splashproof and may be immersed in water for a time without damage; Apple though does not guarantee the phone will remain undamaged if it is accidentally left in a pocket and subsequently endures a complete wash/spin cycle7. There’s no doubt about it, the new dual camera system on the 7 is fantastic8. There are three options for memory capacity (naturally with rising price tags as you go up): 32G, 128G and 256G. I would suggest that unless you’re continuously streaming hi-def videos and downloading big games, 32G is going to be enough for most users with a storage capacity such that you’re unlikely to ever need more9. Everything you do on the phone including your contacts may be backed up on the i-cloud, so should your phone be lost and not recovered, a new one may be easily reconfigured with your preferred settings and contact databaseGripes: very few -1. The battery life isn’t great but is an improvement on the 5 and 6, and moreover you can now buy a phone case incorporating 24-hours of extra battery life, though it makes the phone more bulky2. The price of the 7 is high for a buyer on a modest income, but as usual you get what you pay for and this is a premium productIt’s easy to see why Apple maintains market leadership with such excellent products and back-up service through their funky high street/mall Apple stores full of knowledgeable, intelligent and helpful staff. Make sure you buy a screen protector and a silicone rubber-back case to protect the sides of the phone in case it gets accidentally dropped on the street – which it eventually will.Finally, some one-star reviews posted on amazon are from buyers griping about having been shipped locked or otherwise non-functional phones by online sellers. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints about the seller. One solution is to buy from an Apple store; they’ll set up the new iPhone for you, transfer all your contacts, settings and data from your old phone and be available to resolve any subsequent issues.	1
Arrived promptly and all in order.	1
Excellent service and quality	1
Amazing product, absolutely love it! Its a massive step from the iPhone 6. I love the 4.7 Retina display and the response is amazing!!!	1
Christmas present for my insignificant other, she loves it, great phone	1
Hey I have a YouTube channel and I would love to do a video about your product. A free sample would help massively to promote your product. Thanks get back to me!	1
This review is for the IPhone 7, in general, not this ""unlocked"" model. I bought my first IPhone today, the IPhone 7. I paid over 700 Euro for it, with a no-contract, no-bill Vodafone-locked handset. First impression: excellent quality, the main reason I bought the Iphone 7. I've owned an Apple IPod Nano for years, it still plays great-sounding music, it's build quality is second to none, the rechargeable battery still provides hours of listening. So, I knew already the Apple range of products are exceptionally well-built. Having owned various Android smartphones I was reluctant to buy an IPhone. An IPhone has usually cost that bit more. Plus, the ransom ware targeting Apple IPhones specifically seems a terrible risk. But, being unfamiliar with an IPhone and having used the IPhone 7 for the day I'm happy to say it's every bit as quality a product as I'd hoped, it's easy to set up, feels lightweight and I know precisely where my money spent went. I can't yet comment on the IPhone 7's features but I'm already confident like a Volvo, (I drove a 7-40 model), and Mercedes Benz, BMW car, I know the investment is worth it. I see myself using this handset, like the IPod Nano, for a long time to come. Solid piece of kit.	1
Brilliant service from Telephones Online. Lovely phone but not yet convinced battery is better than iphone 6  might even be worse	1
Everything and more, and haven't got into All it offers yet	1
This phone is not just a phone, but for many it is a status symbol, telling others not only can I afford this new device but that I am technically savvy and keeping up with the Apple bandwagon of new devices in a fast moving technical field.To be honest, there is very little change in the appearance to the new iPhone 7 compared to its predecessor, however, that’s not the point as it is exactly what the Apple enthusiast would expect in that it is a visual attractive, powerful, reliable and efficient device with some internal upgrades that will help apps to work faster and additional obvious enhancements that will satisfy the customers desire to purchase one.So what is new and why did I get one?Memory size:  The 128GB seems to be the best and most popular option with best value for money, as it is sufficient to carry all your apps, additional memory needs and other normal things that you need to access.  The 256GB is just a ridiculous luxury and waste of money as there are very few users that could fill that size of memory.Design:  The design has not changed much in that the body and screen sizes are virtually the same as the iPhone 6 and it still has round edges and a nice feel in the hand.  There is still a protruding camera lens on the rear that some users might find irritating as this takes away a flush finish on the rear of the device.External Sound:  This has been greatly improved by the introduction of dual speakers positioned at the top and bottom of the device.  This has improved the sound quality immensely, which now produces decent stereo sound, great for listening to music or watching a movie without an earpiece.Headphone Jack:  This has been removed and replaced with a lightning port, but why is the question; simple answer is that it has released space for internal upgrades by removing the old out of date 3.5mm input.  This could be a big game changer for people who have bought expensive earphones that come with the 3.5mm headphone jack capability only.  However, you get an adaptor with the iPhone 7 that allows the 3.5mm jack to insert into the lightning port and the iPhone 7 does come with a pair of lightning port compatible ear buds.  They are actually really good and this new system is good, as Apple has decided to take a bold step, embracing change for the better and the future in design and innovation of smart phones.Bluetooth:  This has been enhanced with the addition of Apples own Proprietary wireless standard, which is so simple to use, where items such as the Apple AirPods (wireless ear phones) connect automatically when the AirPods are placed next to the iPhone.  These are brilliant as they are based on new tech where they pause music automatically when you remove one from your ear and they automatically switch from iPhone to iPad, or Apple watch.  You can buy the ear AirPods separately for 1,59 pounds and they are brilliant.Water resistant:  I must admit I did have great fun taking pictures of my son diving into a pool on holiday once with a waterproof phone.  The expression on his face as he entered the water was captured from under the water, which added a new dimension to our holiday snaps.  Therefore it is a great feature if you are next to the pool or sea on holiday, or if you just want to watch films in the bath.  On a more serious note, I have had a phone that accidently got wet and was ruined and therefore even if it is only protection for such a valuable and essential item then it is worth having the waterproof capability.Battery life:  Apple claim that the battery life has been increased from its predecessor to an extra 2 hours in normal use.  However, this is something that each user and the type of use with the device will no doubt determine.Camera: The rear camera still protrudes from the body however; you now get a dual lens main camera combining a wide angle lens and telephoto lens with much better low light capability, richer snaps and a faster shutter speed.  The front camera has also been increased to 7MP.Minor changes:  The home button now vibrates under your finger rather than clicking all the way in and the finger print recognition requires more pressure than previous iPhones.  To be honest this is just a slightly different feel for both functions but nothing to jump up and down about.Screen resolution:  The screen resolution and appearance doesn’t appear to be any different even if there have been internal upgrades to 1080 resolution and to be honest Apple are still way behind Samsung with their OHD resolution.Overall there is not a great deal of change especially to the appearance of the new iPhone 7, but with the internal upgrades and minor enhancements that they have made it is enough to get any Apple enthusiast excited.	1
I bought this for my daughter and she looooved it. I would definitely buy this one for myself in future when my pocket allows lol!	1
Phone is fantastic	1
Unless your an intrevert with no friends and no social media expectations 32GB is too small and you may find yourself needing an expensive upgrade to the larger 128GB to accommodate your needs.This phone is not just a phone, but for many it is a status symbol, telling others not only can I afford this new device but that I am technically savvy and keeping up with the Apple bandwagon of new devices in a fast moving technical field.To be honest, there is very little change in the appearance to the new iPhone 7 compared to its predecessor, however, that’s not the point as it is exactly what the Apple enthusiast would expect in that it is a visual attractive, powerful, reliable and efficient device with some internal upgrades that will help apps to work faster and additional obvious enhancements that will satisfy the customers desire to purchase one.So what is new and why did I get one?Memory size:  The 128GB seems to be the best and most popular option with best value for money, as it is sufficient to carry all your apps, additional memory needs and other normal things that you need to access.  The 32GB is just too small and the 256GB is just a ridiculous luxury and waste of money as there are very few users that could fill that size of memory.Design:  The design has not changed much in that the body and screen sizes are virtually the same as the iPhone 6 and it still has round edges and a nice feel in the hand.  There is still a protruding camera lens on the rear that some users might find irritating as this takes away a flush finish on the rear of the device.External Sound:  This has been greatly improved by the introduction of dual speakers positioned at the top and bottom of the device.  This has improved the sound quality immensely, which now produces decent stereo sound, great for listening to music or watching a movie without an earpiece.Headphone Jack:  This has been removed and replaced with a lightning port, but why is the question; simple answer is that it has released space for internal upgrades by removing the old out of date 3.5mm input.  This could be a big game changer for people who have bought expensive earphones that come with the 3.5mm headphone jack capability only.  However, you get an adaptor with the iPhone 7 that allows the 3.5mm jack to insert into the lightning port and the iPhone 7 does come with a pair of lightning port compatible ear buds.  They are actually really good and this new system is good, as Apple has decided to take a bold step, embracing change for the better and the future in design and innovation of smart phones.Bluetooth:  This has been enhanced with the addition of Apples own Proprietary wireless standard, which is so simple to use, where items such as the Apple AirPods (wireless ear phones) connect automatically when the AirPods are placed next to the iPhone.  These are brilliant as they are based on new tech where they pause music automatically when you remove one from your ear and they automatically switch from iPhone to iPad, or Apple watch.  You can buy the ear AirPods separately for 1,59 pounds and they are brilliant.Water resistant:  I must admit I did have great fun taking pictures of my son diving into a pool on holiday once with a waterproof phone.  The expression on his face as he entered the water was captured from under the water, which added a new dimension to our holiday snaps.  Therefore it is a great feature if you are next to the pool or sea on holiday, or if you just want to watch films in the bath.  On a more serious note, I have had a phone that accidently got wet and was ruined and therefore even if it is only protection for such a valuable and essential item then it is worth having the waterproof capability.Battery life:  Apple claim that the battery life has been increased from its predecessor to an extra 2 hours in normal use.  However, this is something that each user and the type of use with the device will no doubt determine.Camera: The rear camera still protrudes from the body however; you now get a dual lens main camera combining a wide angle lens and telephoto lens with much better low light capability, richer snaps and a faster shutter speed.  The front camera has also been increased to 7MP.Minor changes:  The home button now vibrates under your finger rather than clicking all the way in and the finger print recognition requires more pressure than previous iPhones.  To be honest this is just a slightly different feel for both functions but nothing to jump up and down about.Screen resolution:  The screen resolution and appearance doesn’t appear to be any different even if there have been internal upgrades to 1080 resolution and to be honest Apple are still way behind Samsung with their OHD resolution.Overall there is not a great deal of change especially to the appearance of the new iPhone 7, but with the internal upgrades and minor enhancements that they have made it is enough to get any Apple enthusiast excited and even thou this phone is only 32GB it still deserves 5 stars.	1
this new phone from apple is so powerful in its small form . Apple took it to the next level and created not a phone but a computer ! Not every one will agree to buy apple products because of the software but i think it is simple modern and easy to use. the down sides are that it has no 3.5 mm jack  for audio however you get an adapter from 3.5 mm jack to lightning which i think is pretty nice from apples side . i love the black finish on the phone and the camera is 12mp on the front so it can shoot 4k videos no problemthank you for reading my review on the iphone 7 :)	1
Unless your an intrevert with no friends and no social media expectations, why spend this amount of money on a brilliant phone and only have 32GB when for not much more you can buy the 128GB phone which will save disappointment when you realise you don't have enough memory.This phone is not just a phone, but for many it is a status symbol, telling others not only can I afford this new device but that I am technically savvy and keeping up with the Apple bandwagon of new devices in a fast moving technical field.To be honest, there is very little change in the appearance to the new iPhone 7 compared to its predecessor, however, that’s not the point as it is exactly what the Apple enthusiast would expect in that it is a visual attractive, powerful, reliable and efficient device with some internal upgrades that will help apps to work faster and additional obvious enhancements that will satisfy the customers desire to purchase one.So what is new and why did I get one?Memory size:  The 128GB seems to be the best and most popular option with best value for money, as it is sufficient to carry all your apps, additional memory needs and other normal things that you need to access.

Bought as my wife loves hers. Model 7 more than enough to meet my needs - no need for newer model	1
Great phone - smaller size which I like - camera very good, great pictures	1
This is an excellent phone for a retired person and moves quickly from app to app.	1
An excellent phone at a good price	1
Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Good seller good pbone	1
I  bought this refurbished iPhone 7plus because the price was good. It arrived very quickly, and was exceptionally well packaged. When I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised by the refurbishment. It literally looked like a new phone.In terms of functionality, everything worked like a new iPhone, with one exception. The home button had some 'play' in it and was sometimes a bit flaky when it came to unlocking the phone using the fingerprint technology.The battery life has been very good - comparable with a new phone in fact. The only time it drains unnecessarily quickly is because of quirks with Apple software, for example, you find that location services are turned on for apps that don't actually need it.Other than that, I would highly recommend this phone.	1
I am really happy with my new iPhone 7 Plus! The battery is amazing and do we want to talk about the dual camera??? Brilliant!	1
Found an excellent phone for an unbeatable price from this awesome seller. Very happy with service: seller made sure I knew what I was buying before shipping the item. No issues at all after 8 months.	1

Firstly let me give credit to Amazon for their excellent service. I went into a well known store which is on my driving route, thinking that I could just walk away with a newly purchased iPhone 7, but to be told that they did not have one and it would take two days to have one delivered to my home at a time that was inconvenient to me! On the same evening I went on to Amazon made my order and had it delivered to a local collection point the next day by 1pm. Brilliant !What about the iPhone 7? Well I have had a iPhone 4, a couple of iPhone 5's and now a 7. Well for me it is progress and in particular I think that this is just the right screen size, especially as I am of a mature age and sometimes find the text size a bit challenging. Most things are in the right places and there are new features which I will consider setting up as i get more familiar. The finger print reader is a good idea, as I have had this on one of my laptops for many years. It is very easy to set up. The main negative for me is the price is perhaps a bit too high however Amazon was cheaper than the shop I first tried so do shop around. However I hope to use this for a few years and so will get good value that way. So if your ready for an upgrade or a new kid on the block, I recommend it	1
Absolutely love it!! If you guys are like me: afraid to spend this big amount of money online for a phone that you're not sure will turn out original well then you can be sure you will receive a brand new iPhone 7plus buying from here!! Love it love it	1
So you’ve managed to set some money aside, right in time for the release of the best new smartphone from Apple. In recent years, iPhone users have been met with only one question when deciding their phone for the next year: Small or Big? But now, Apple has made us change this question entirely. Small, Big or Stupid Expensive? For the price of your 17 year old’s Peugeot 308, Apple is asking up to £1,400 for their latest innovation into the smartphone world. Is this too much? Yes of course it is. Not only am I here to say you should skip the iPhone X (or 10 depending on your preference), I am here to say skip this year's generation entirely. The iPhone 7 Plus, in my opinion, is the best iPhone you can buy right now; and it won’t blow the back out your wallet either.Dual 12MP Rear Facing Camera's, 1080p 5.5inch Display, Liquid Like Smoothness and Performance, Touch ID, Waterproofing....there is not a lot of area's in which this phone set's a foot wrong. In my experience, it has been a joy to use this phone and have done for 2 months now.Now,  at this point in my review, I’m guessing most of your thinking “Another Apple fanboy…”. But let me reassure you. This is my first proper go at an iPhone experience. I’m typing this very review on an Asus Chromebook I bought off Gumtree and don’t even own a watch, let alone a smart one. In the past I have been frustrated with the slowness of Android phones in general; watching iPhone users get halfway through the first level of Angry Birds before I am even though the loading screen (yes, I still play Angry Birds!). The main reason I turned to Tim Cook is that iPhone’s just work and the software is optimised to work with the hardware. They may not have the features a Samsung Galaxy S8 has or the camera of a Google Pixel 2, but I can bet money today, my iPhone 7 Plus will still be in my pocket for years to come.I know you haven't go all day so I'm going to finish up now by way of a checklist. Camera - Great. Battery Life - Great. Build Quality - Tank Like. Display - Good but no Samsung S8 good! Waterproofing - Neat. Performance - Smooth as Frank Sinatra.You're not going to be disappointed with this phone at all. It might lack a headphone jack (but at least they still give you an adapter!), and might not have the edge to edge display of the Samsung Galaxy S8 or iPhone X but this phone is not for the person who wants the latest technological advancements anymore. This is for the 9-5 businessman, who needs a small computer in their pocket. This is for the stay at home mum, who wants great photos of their kids before they go off to school or college. This is for the retired father, taking their first leap into modern day technology. Whoever you are, you won't be disappointed with an iPhone 7 Plus in your pocket.	1
Bought this new and it's great - it's still in original packing and the 1 year guarantee was activated the day i received it! Highly recommend.	1
Fast delivery, great seller services and the iPhone is brand new and unlocked like said.	1
It is of high quality and great design. I love it so much!	1
Excellent upgrade especially coming from an iPhone 6.Can't complain at all. All the features do make a big difference if you are coming from the previous version.	1
Love it, an awesome phone and aside from a few hiccups with delivery it arrived in perfect condition and I was playing with it 1/2 hour after setup downloaded all my previous phones settings from the cloud and I was all set. This was £169 cheaper than going through apple direct, no brainer. top marks	1
fantastic, wonderful, love it, never owned an i phone before, always had an android, this is so much better, highly recommended	1
Absolutely Love this iPhone 7 plus !! Got a good value from Amazon, with coupons became even better!! Easy to set up especially if you are already an iPhone user. Does so many things, fantastic picture quality, can't leave without it!	1
Excellent product just as described.I bought two described as very good and they were like new.I bought one described a good and it had a very slight blemish on the screen which i covered with protective glass.With a 12 month warranty they are great value.I would recommend to anyone i knew.Thank you very much.RegardsMonty Moseley.	1
Excellent	1
Does what it says on the tin!	1
The iPhone keeps getting better and better. I have had every iPhone since they were first released.  The iPhone 7 plus does not disappoint.If you've ever used an iPhone before you know exactly what to expect, great build quality and a fantastic user interface.If you are an Apple person you really can't go wrong.Yes, there are phones out with larger screens and smaller overall size but you have to put up with the android or windows interface.  I use a Samsung android phone for work and it sucks, yes, you can modify almost everything on it, but that's because you need to.If you are think about getting the iPhone 7 plus just do it, you won't regret it.	1
Really good product, fast delivery and helpful staff. I recommend!	1
It would have been an excellent product had I not had to return said item as it was too large	1
Love the phone, many thanks just what I was looking for	1
Love it , fast , good picture quality and reliable .	1
Delivered as promissed. A 6s plus Box but who cares. Phone is flawless.	1
Am so happy with my purchase really needed a new phone it came fresh in a box with everything inside nothing was missing it was brand new also i was so happy that it came the next day after ordered it	1
Best mobile phone I've ever had!! Moved from Android to iOS about 2 weeks ago and will never go back to Android.The overall performance of the phone is fantastic better than I expected not laggy always gets the job done quickly as possible.Camera is excellent never experienced a camera with the raw quality of this one you get perfect shots every time.App Store there are more games and apps on the Apple Store which are better optimised for battery performance with is awesome less power been used is bonus.Lastly but not least well done Apple for putting together a well built and crafted phone that is not just for pleasure but for other things aswell.5/5 rating	1
Love iPhone 7 as far more better and faster than 6s Plus.	1
So Royal Mail take 9 days to deliver. This is a standard it seems when looking at previous reviews. Otherwise I received a phone worth a good working battery, clear screen and it’s very cheap. The phone does have lots of wear but with a case it’s not noticeable and you’d put a new case on a new phon anyway I’d hope! Very happy with the product.	1
the best	1
So i am really surprise that  this is the actual phone for everyone it has everything everyone will like to have in there phone and the product has incredible security on it and also smooth scream  i was an iPhone 4 user but using this product just changed my life and it brilliant .https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01LW36C3L/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0	1
Amazing phone	1
All as it should be and in great condition phone is fabulous.	1
Product came reset and basically looking brand new, literally no scratches and, excellent condition and get battery life. Worthwhile purchase	1
Brilliant phone	1
I loved it so soft push made for you so good buy it now press buy	1
I would like to product by asking for a free product	1
Looks pretty legit doesn't it	1
Design:The new iPhone is not a massive change from the 6 and 6S. It features the same rounded edges and 4.7” and 5.5” screen sizes as before, and is the 3rd in a line of an iterative design started by the 6. The most notable differences are the new Black and Jet Black finishes and the larger camera bump which is now built into the enclosure. I personally love my Jet Black finish as it looks like a mirrored surface and the front and back meet seamlessly - almost like a slab of aluminium. It also feels great in the hand with a more grippy surface than its matte siblings. I have got micro-abrasions on mine but these are only really able to be seen in bright light and in normal light are not noticeable. I have however kept my phone in a case since I received it and have seen pictures on the internet with very bad scratches on the iPhone. If you take care of it, it’ll be fine.One major difference and the cause of a lot of controversy with the new iPhone has to be the headphone jack - it’s gone. I thought I’d miss this a lot more than I did. The included adapter really helps the transition and just stays plugged into my earphones from now on which doesn’t really affect me. I also own a few bluetooth headphones and these work perfectly with the new iPhone. My only gripe has been when I have wanted to use my phone for Discord or any other App that needs headphones and charge. Usually I don’t need to do this but I prefer to plug in when I am gaming to stop the phone from dropping in battery too fast. My workaround was to use bluetooth headphones for this but the other solution would be to get a splitter, something that isn’t too expensive.The main reason for removing the headphone jack in the iPhone was to increase waterproofing. The new iPhone finally gets my most desired feature. I no longer have to baby my phone in the rain or be wary when changing songs in the shower. From tests seen on the internet, the waterproofing is very good on this phone and usually better than the IP68 rating it has. Apple is usually very conservative with its rating systems and although I wouldn't suggest going swimming with the phone, it’ll easily handle the odd splash or drop in the toilet. Using the phone with wet fingers or with droplets on the screen has also improved and I am very impressed with this. Before, a nearly dry hand was needed to operate the phone due to accidental inputs with the water droplets on the screen. On the new iPhone however, the rejection of these inputs has been sublime. Apple also claims a higher colour gamut screen on the iPhone which I didn't really notice but I really noticed the 25% extra brightness which helps outdoors. I would love to see an OLED display on a phone but until VR comes to the iPhone, I really think that a 1080p panel boasts the best battery life/performance/DPI ratio on a 5.5” phone.The new stereo speakers on the phone are another welcome addition I have wanted for a while. Apple claims a 50% increase in volume and I fully believe them. At max volume there is (almost) no distortion and they sound really loud - so loud I can leave my bluetooth speaker when I go to the shower. For casual listening, they are a god send. The automatic change when rotated is also great and the phone seems to output the same volume in both orientations, something I tested to see if it was the case. One thing to note with the added waterproofing is that when the speakers get wet, their volume reduces drastically and distortion is heard. This is solved when the phone dries after about 5-10 minutes but is just something to bear in mind.Performance and Camera:The performance on the iPhone 7 is just as good as the 6S. Although Apple claims a 40% increase in performance since the 6S, the UI is so smooth that you can’t notice it. It will be great for future proofing however and I welcome the change. Apple has swayed from its usual dual core chip however; the A10 is now quad-core although it doesn't use all four cores at the same time. Two are low powered cores which use 1/5 of the power of the A9 with the same performance whilst the other two are the high performance cores with the 40% increase in compute. This really ingenuous solution along with the slightly larger battery has made sure that the iPhone lasts all but the most demanding days. I regularly ended the day with 20% left which is a lot better than the basically 0% my 6S Plus used to rock up on.Both the front and rear cameras have been upgraded on the new model too. With a larger aperture, both can now take better low light photos. The front camera now takes 7MP photos and its low light performance has gotten really good - almost too good as now all my pores can be seen! The real star of the show is the back camera however. Low light performance is really good, on par with the S7, the current leader in this respect. Optical Image Stabilisation is also standard on all iPhone 7 models now which really helps with reducing the shake on videos and reducing blur in photos, especially in low light. The real step up for the 7 is the extra camera on the back (making 3 total). This camera is dubbed the ‘telephoto’ lens and is a 2x zoom from the normal. This allows great zooming without loss of quality. Another thing it enables is ‘Portrait mode’, a DSLR like option which allows the background to be blurred out. This, although still in beta, seems to be really good and has produced some amazing shots, better than any compact camera I have used and rivalling (not replacing) DSLR quality at first look.Software Experience:The new iPhone 7s all ship with iOS 10, Apple’s latest iteration of its mobile software. It does away with some things, namely ‘Slide to Unlock’, a legacy Apple creation and has now been replaced with ‘Press Home to Unlock’. This new method of unlock is really great for phones with Touch ID (not so great for non-Touch ID but that’s a different story) and along with raise to wake, makes your phone just seem more alive and useful. The widgets when swiping left are really useful for quick glances. I will look up my next lecture or check what reminders I have with a quick swipe and that will be it, a lot more convenient than before.3D touch has been getting better and better and the new lock screen combined with 3D Touch has just become a really great experience. 3D Touching on a Notification will bring up quick actions and even sometimes an actual window with previews of messages. This is an ingenious feature which has really helped with quick replies and is just something that is fun to do. Before, 3D Touch was limited to previewing and shortcuts and now it is so much more. So many apps take advantage of it for extra content, quick settings and its convenience and tight integration is something you don’t find on any other smartphone. I have got used to shortcuts from my 6S and now use a few, not as many as Apple may hope but enough to justify it as a feature.One of my favourite features about the new iPhone 7 has to be the Taptic Engine. It has been improved since the 6S to now vibrate on some other things happening in the system. For example pulling down the notification shade causes a small bump when it hits the bottom, when scrolling through the different minutes in the clock app, it will give a small bump at each one it scrolls past. Although these may seem like small things, this really gives the iPhone a mechanical feel which is really nice. I actively seek out ways to use these things as they just feel so futuristic whilst retro at the same time, a throwback to the mechanical days.This Taptic Engine is also used to power the home button. No longer a physical switch, the home button is now a solid state button that activates when it senses a force on it. At first I was not so sure about the button. It feels different to anything I have used before and sometimes can feel like the whole bottom of the phone is moving. However, I quickly became used to it and now prefer it to anything else. It never fails and feels quite realistic and I welcome a change that will reduce the fragileness of a button whilst also improving its waterproofing capabilities.Durability: Over my month and a bit with the phone, I have (as mentioned) picked up a few micro abrasions on the phone. It goes everywhere with me; the gym, rock climbing, lectures, excursions and so on and looks almost new. I do use a screen protector however and over one of the parts where it is not covered, I have picked up a small scratch. I don’t baby my phone however. As it is all solid state I will chuck the phone on a desk and take it to places other people wouldn’t take it like rock climbing where chalk and the constant fear of people falling on your phone is rife. I really like the waterproofing of the phone as it means I can run it under a tap when done to wash off anything. I have had back protectors (like screen protectors but for the back of the phone) on however to reduce the risk of scratches however my first application didn’t go too well. When removing the film, I did notice that some of the markings were coming off the phone. These have just got fainter and are hard to see in normal light. I actually prefer this however as I never really liked the markings on the back of the phone however might be annoying when trying to read the serial number or any important information.Conclusion:The iPhone 7 is a great phone. After all the negativity of the removal of the headphone jack, it seems that many people actually can go without it, especially with the inclusion of an adapter in the box. The iPhone 7 has quite a few more features that do warrant its 7 name and its camera has been significantly upgraded in the low light department, taking really good pictures in the dark. Before with the 6S, I could see more in the dark than it, but the 7 seems to be able to pick up more than I can. I truly believe that this phone can sit with other flagship phones of 2016.	1
My relationship with Android lasted for six weeks……. Here’s why I came back to Apple following the death of the Note 7.I was one of the lucky people who got their hands on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on pre-order launch day!! Yes for the first time in almost a decade, I had decided to move away from Apple iPhones and give Android a try.  How did that go for me though?  Well I can honestly say that I really loved many things about the Note 7 and by association, the Android platform.  Then the first recall happened.  I was slightly irritated!! Then the final ‘give it back NOW please’.I looked around at an alternative to the Note 7.  My criteria were……- 5.5” or larger screen- Fast processor and lots of RAM- Better than average battery life- Lots of storage space- Top quality camera- WaterproofThere were a couple of Samsung features that I really loved, but I knew I had to live without them if I wanted a premium device that wasn’t Samsung - wireless charging being the main one.So why the iPhone 7 Plus then?  Looking at my list of requirements, I couldn’t find a single alternative that could offer all of these features that WASN’T the iPhone.  I remember watching the Apple keynote about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with my Note 7 in my hand, almost hoping that it would be a disappointment.  Sadly the only gripe that I could find was the lack of the 3.5mm headphone socket.  I’ve found a solution to that problem which cost around £15 - Mpow Streambot Mini Bluetooth 4.0 A2DP Wireless Receiver Adapter for Audio Streaming System and Car Kits.  So I’ve had the iPhone 7 Plus for about two weeks now and here’s my early review.Form FactorI have to say that I love the feel of the iPhone 7 Plus.  The silver model looks beautiful naked.  It’s slightly slippery in the hand so if you’re not going to use a case, I recommend a good quality skin or you’re going to drop it.  Apple have redesigned the phone to make the antenna bands less visible, and they’ve got it spot on.  The sleep/wake button, slightly redesigned volume buttons and the mute switch are all in the same place, as is the home key, but this is one of the major redesigns for 2016 - the home key is no longer a physical button.  Apple have used their Taptic Engine to trick your finger into believing you’ve pressed a button, and it really does work.  Whether you want to wake up your phone, launch Siri or close an app, the brand new home key let’s you know that it’s received your command with a little buzz.  There’s even a choice of how much feedback you get from the button.  In my opinion, this great new feature also means that there’s one less piece of hardware to fail and it also forms a part of how the phone has become water resistant.DisplayLet’s be honest, Apple don’t seem to lead the field in mobile phone displays right now.  They don’t seem to have increased the pixel density of their displays since the iPhone 4’s launch of the Retina display.  That said, the iPhone 7 Plus offers a much improved ‘wide colour gamut’.  That means a far more real reproduction on your display than previous models.  Comparing this to the Galaxy Note 7 or S7 (the same display), it’s clear to see that Apple have made an improvement here, and you could argue that the human eye can’t distinguish between the quality of displays beyond 400ppi so it really becomes about manufacturer spec-boasting.  As I review my photos, I feel that they are more alive than ever.  Added to this, the 3D Touch feature, which I felt was a bit of a white elephant last year, really comes into its own now.  More and more 3rd party apps have embraced the concept and now you can use force touch to simplify tasks.  No other brand offers this technology right now and it wasn’t until I started using it again, after my six weeks in the Samsung wilderness, that I realised how much I’ve missed it.CameraWhat can I say about the iPhone 7 Plus camera?  One word - WOW.  iOS 10.1 brought with it the fantastic ‘Portrait Mode’ update, promised in the iPhone 7 launch keynote.  This is Apple’s best ever camera and it truly is the best camera I have ever owned.  Not only is it lightning fast to launch - take the phone out of your pocket and raise it to eye level, swipe to the left and bang it’s ready to shoot - but everything about it is improved.  The all-new wide colour gamut on the display gives you a much more reliable preview of your picture before you shoot, focusing is quick and reliable and the new telephoto lens allows for 2x optical zoom which really does make a difference.  It also means that the phone is capable of 10x digital zoom to a much higher quality.  The difference between this camera and the 6S is really noticeable.Portrait mode is a breakthrough.  Some Android phones have tried to mimic this feature, but Apple use a mixture of hardware and software ‘machine learning’ to give an effect that you would only normally find from a DSLR and a talented photographer.  I find it hard to take a photo without trying to use this mode now, and the results I’ve had in just a few days of the update are remarkable.  All in all, the latest iPhone snapper is a stand-out feature.WaterproofingHotly anticipated for the iPhone 7 / 7 Plus was some kind of waterproofing.  Many reviewers believed the 6S to be waterproof but I for one didn’t ever put that to the test.  Apple have achieved this for 2016 by making a few changes - the SIM tray now has a rubber seal, there is no earphone socket letting water in and the home key is software based rather than a hardware ‘button’.  All of those boring details give you a phone that can take a few splashes.  Apple say that you can submerge the phone is 1.5m of water for 30 minutes and have rated it IP67, making it officially water RESISTANT.  They have quite cleverly excluded water damage from the warranty though so please beware if you’re going for a dip.  I feel a lot more confident with my phone in my hand near water or around the washing up bowl, and I am delighted to be able to listen to music in the shower, though I still keep my 7 Plus well away from getting drowned.StorageThe Cupertino posse treated us to an increase in storage space this year.  Whilst there is still (and probably this will never change) no microSD slot, the base iPhone 7 now has 32GB of storage.  I’ve plumped for the 256GB, flagship model.  It means I’m unlikely to ever have a problem when taking lots of photos or video and I can store enough music to last for weeks of listening.  It’s good that Apple have listened to their customers’ need for more storage space, but I really wish they would think about adding removable storage….Battery LifeAnother year, another increase in battery life!!  This year Apple have treated us to quite a bump up in juice.  I’ve been getting a consistent 12 hours of unplugged use with my 7 Plus by virtue of the new 2900 mAr cell compared to 10 hours in last year’s 2750 mAr offering.  I’m somebody who has battery percentage paranoia and I feel totally confident to go about my daily business without an emergency charger in sight.  Compared to my doomed Note 7 with its 3500 mAhr, Apple seem to use their home-grown link between software and hardware to offer an unbelievably good battery life.  Added to that, the recently added ‘low power’ mode can add hours of extra life if you get caught without a charger for a long period of time.ProcessorThe latest A10 Fusion chip gives a multi-core Geekbench score of 5645 compared to the now defunked Note 7’s 5617.  In reality though, the iPhone 7 Plus massively outperforms Samsung’s 7 series phones by a country mile.  This could well be in part due to the deeper integration between software and hardware in Apple’s products, along with generally better quality apps in the Apple App Store.  Games seem to render faster and better and even with the Samsung developer tweaks, the iPhone still outperforms in transitions from home screen to app and vice versa.  The improved in-house designed A10 Fusion processor is further augmented by the additional 1GB RAM present in the iPhone 7 Plus.Earphone SocketI must confess that one of the worst kept secrets of the iPhone 7 was the removal of the 3.5mm earphone socket, and for me this was a problem.  A few weeks in and I have yet to use to bundled ‘lightning EarPods’ or the lightning to 3.5mm jack adapter.  Instead I’ve embraced bluetooth 4 and now use a fantastic device from Mpow which cost around £15 and allows me to plug in any old earphones into a ridiculously small box which receives a bluetooth signal from my iPhone.  The battery lasts around 10 hours with a 1.5 hour charge.  So who needs an earphone socket?  Well as a professional DJ and entertainer, my phone has always been an emergency fall-back device incase my MacBook suddenly fails, but for that to work for me I now need to carry around some kind of lightning adapter AND ensure that my phone has got enough battery as there is no way to charge the phone and play music through the lightning port at the same time.  I’m sure there will be an Apple approved solution to this problem some time soon, and once there is, one will definitely live in my laptop bag!!Virus and Malware Protection and Software UpdatesAs a long - term Apple user, both Mac and iOS, I have become used to the hassle - free nature of the marriage between software and hardware.  The area where this is by far the most apparent is in virus protection.  I can remember the darker days of Windows where the most innocent of email attachments could cause the world to come crashing down and my PC to completely stop working.  It seems that these issues are still very present within the non - iOS community, as I found when WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger both stopped working on my Android handset.  I couldn’t quite believe that this was happening on a 2016, flagship device, but it seems that I have been spoiled with Tim Cook’s gang and their commitment to keeping our devices and data safe.  If none of the features above have convinced you, take a moment to consider a world where you don’t have to worry about viruses.  Comforting though….Apple users are also blessed with regular-as-clockwork software updates.  You can set your watch on Apple’s schedule of releases of their iOS platform, and the statistics are astounding.  As of 27th October 2016, 60% of iPhone users are already running iOS 10, which was only released three weeks ago, compared to only 1% of Android users running version 7 which has been out for quite some time longer.  Even now, only 19% of Android users are running version 6, which was released in 2015!!!  Those are shocking statistics which are also very reassuring for Apple users as every update of iOS includes security patches that keep our devices safe from virus and malware attacks.So these are my thoughts on the iPhone 7 Plus 256GB.  As it turns out, it outperforms Samsung’s flagship 7 series devices is every feature with the exception of the earphone socket.  It seems like the demise of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 couldn’t have come at a better time for me as it saved me from myself and brought me back home to where my heart belongs……	1
I have had my iPhone 7 plus and it is great. I had the iPhone 6 and since I have upgraded and it fantastic I can't use my iPhone 6 no more it to small it the best phone I have had. I world strongly agree if you have a lot of thing on your iPhone pic,music and videos/apps you get it	1
I have bought the iPhone 7PLUS 256GB directly from Apple and have been using it for a few weeks. It is a brilliant devise and a pleasure to use. The camera function is superb. The phone is perfect in every way.A few days ago I have accidentally put it into the washing machine. It went through a 40C wash/spin cycle at 1200RPM. I was very distressed and thought I have ruined my phone but when I've turned it on, it worked perfectly. I have tested most of the functions, including the camera and so far everything is in order.The iphone 7 is meant to be waterproof but I very much doubt Apple tested it in a washing machine. I can definitely say that it IS waterproof.	1
Hi, my work place is upgrading phones soon and at they are thinking of going with the samsung s8+ as we didn't manage to get a sample of the iphone 7+ yet and since i personally have the 6 i'm more then sure it'll have a nice experience.	1
I would like to do a promotion of your product on my YouTube channel for a free model for me to demonstrate on my brothers channel mkbhd.	1
Dear Apple I love your products and am thinking of buying it, is there a chance of me getting a sample?	1

Hi,I'm have a big YouTube and Instagram page and I would love a free product to promote for you.	1
Is good it arrived intact I thought this was fake	1
The iPhone 7 Plus is a beautiful phone that's still very reliable & easy to use. The software is super fluid, even with iOS 12. I love the camera but miss the headphone jack. Still with buying in 2019/20	1
Excellent phone just like new not a mark on it! And the price was excellent value, will buy from this selller again.	1
Bought this as a replacement for iPhone 7. Can see display better.	1
Purchased to replace an ageing 4S. Nice big clear screen in an easy to use size. The things I don't like are features of iOS 12 rather than the phone.	1
This was for my Wife,She thinks this is the best phone She has owned. Loves it	1
Bought for my mother due to old iPhone 4 dying,She love the fact it’s battery lasts her a few days and how easy it is using iOS as in it’s easy to swap between devices and not having to learn all over again!	1
Original, fully boxed, perfect, been using it about 3/4 of a year now and perfect.	1
I love my new phone.	1
My granddaughter loves this phone would recomened	1

Without a doubt, one of the best smartphones out there. Fast, stylish, amazing. My personal favourite out of all the ones on the market currently. If the price is a drawback for you - I assure you, it is worth every penny. No cons to this phone.	1
Very happy with this iphone, it came earlier than stated and has fulfilled all my expectations, after reading numerous reviews on various phones, both Android and Apple. Extremely good condition for nearly half the price of a brand new one, only lacking the original box & earphones etc that would normally come with a new purchase, but I knew that, so wasn't disappointed.	1
Outstanding as always from apple if you ignore the price tag. :/	1
Very pleased quick delivery easy set up great buy	1
Love this phone lot of money but well worth it	1
Well pleased as described five stars	1
Need I say anymore??	1

Great phone. Does all that I need. Don't drop it as a screen replacement is around £170.	1
Super fast delivery, great product!	1
I absolutely LOVE this phone. I used to have golden Iphones but this rose color is actually pretty cute!	1
Great Product	1
Absolutely fabulous. The service I received was spot on. The phone is brilliant. I had been looking at the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 plus and couldn't make my mind up which to have. I decided to have the 7 plus. I have not regretted it one bit. It's a great size and to be honest I hardly use my iPad now as the screen is so much better in size than I had expected	1
what can I say...... best phone out there up to now , great screen (see pic) so easy to use	1
What's not to love about this device?(Apart from the price)I don't by Apple for the image. I buy for the ease of use and the reliability. I've not been disappointed by this iPhone.	1
nice	1
My boyfriend loves it.	1
After being a android customer for years, my brother, who works at apple, finally convinced me to switch to iOS when the iPhone 7 plus was announced.  I have had my phone for 8 months now and I can safely say it's by far the best mobile device I've ever owned.  Everything is integrated and easy to use, the camera takes great photos, the speakers are louder and higher quality than the phones of everyone else that I know, the screen is super high resolution and the battery lasts a day and a half before it needs charging (though I usually charge my phone overnight).  I didn't originally purchase my iPhone from Amazon, so I can't comment on the delivery time or things like that, but the phone itself is a must buy if, like me, your phone has become an essential part of daily life.  Attached are 3 photos taken using my camera on my phone.	1
Best phone of 2016-17 i really love the jetblack and is so much faster than the other phones...Highly recommend	1
Can I use this product to make a unbox in video thanks	1
Lovely phone, large screen and superior photo quality. Seems to charge quite slowly. If you buy from Amazon, phone is brand new sealed in box.	1
Ordered the phone on Sunday, arrived today (Tuesday). Everything is present and correct (hope the images help). All appears perfectly legit and I had NO ISSUES setting it up.Side note: after doing an analysis of the prices and the Apple iPhone range the iPhone 7 is definitely the best VALUE FOR MONEY. Which one you choose is up to you!5 Stars and have already recommended it to people!	1
I am very happy with my new IPhone I wanted the plus as it is a bit bigger, the  battery life is fantastic, my son tells me he needs toCharge  his every night I only have to every 3 days so far..	1
My everyday crush 😘😘😘	1
like it	1
Easy to set up and use.  My first smart-phone, but I already have a mini-iPad so have found it mostly intuitive, more so than my daughter's Windows phone.Be aware that although sold SIM-free, i-Phones not bought direct from Apple or other selected resellers (e.g. John Lewis) will become locked to the network of the first SIM inserted.  I was not aware of this until I read the seller's warning included with the package, which also included the option to return the phone unopened if this was not acceptable.  It was not a problem for me, so I was able to accept the phone, but my wife recently tried to change to a different provider's SIM in her i-Phone and is having great difficulty getting her original SIM-only provider to unlock it.	1
Highly recommended that you check the phone is not locked with find my iPhone	1
Product has been reviewed umpteen times over so won't bother repeating that. I wrote to the supplier to ask for dispatch details but before his reply received the item the very next day and son over the moon with his brand new IPhone.	1
Cant believe the price i paid for this refurbished phone.Original box,contents and paperwork.Im sure this phone is new.Very happy user.	1
Very pleased with this phone, especially at this price.This is my first iPhone, ive always had Android and fancied a change.Set up was easy as i have an ipad and ipod touch already.What i like about iOS is its quick, easy, straight to the point.despite its age the phone is highly responsive and fast and is still receiving updates.	1
Great value for the money, when i had a problem setting it up the company were quick to offer help. Would certainly use them again, it even arrived before the promised date.	1
Been putting off getting an iPhone but just had to bite the bullet and saw this. Was afraid it might be refurbished or renewed but it arrived brand new. Very easy to set up. Linked with my iPad so now very tech ready. Would recommend and will buy an upgrade from Amazon when the time comes.	1
No problems	1
It’s an iPhone so not much to say apart from a phone that’s as old as this still holding its price.	1
Excellent, exactly as described, brand new in all the packaging, arrived the next day with prime. Couldn’t be happier!	1
Having been an IPhone 5 user for a long time I knew what to expect but this IPhone 6 has exceeded expectation.The battery life is phenomenal and was amazing value for money.Very pleased	1
So far,so good,daughter is pleased!	1
The thing that bothers me is that i can't turn of the camera sound even in silence mode , everyrhing else works perfect.	1
Thanks for the snickers bar ... a think !!	1
The mobile phone is new, with headphones and charger inside. The quality is really worth it.	1
Definitely recommend!! Great buy!!	1
Amazing quality, literally brand new. No scratches or faults at all and plenty or storage. So happy with this purchase	1
Great value product.	1
I am not technically very literate, but can now facetime my children abroad and have long chats in the UK.  Many people say the iphone 6 is the best phone they ever had, despite all the newer more advanced and expensive models.	1
All works fine, after trying a refurbed one buying new is the best option.	1
Excellent phone	1
Great item, great delivery	1
I like everything about it and there is nothing I dislike about it.	1
Used as a back up down loaded all my information just by holding them opposite each otherAs described and delivered fast	1

Perfect Xmas present for my daughter. Packaged well	1
Quick shipping! The device is working perfectly everything as described! The only things they didn’t mention was a little tiny white spot at the bottom off the screen! But no worries you can’t even see it! I’ll recommend!	1
Is unlocking with any network?	1
it is good	1
Bought this for my husband to replace his dying iPhone 5s.  Amazing delivery time - next day!  Phone is exactly as expected, sealed box and brand new.  Thank you for brilliant service.	1
Purchased as a present so can’t comment on ‘easy to use’ or battery life but it arrived in good time and was as advertised.	1
Excellent supplier - product was far better than I expected. I’m really very pleas with the supplier and the purchase	1
128gb brilliant	1
This phone is an ideal mix of size,capability and cost.It does everything that I need it to do and I don’t feel the need to upgrade any further at the moment	1

Who wouldn't give this a 5 star rating?!!?	1
Superb so far.	1
100 %	1
Used phone but it looks like new, very happy with the purchase.	1
Perfect iPhone .	1
I actually bought this to replace an old iPod Touch (unfortunately they seem to be obsolete) but am now using all the features of the phone. I love the screen size.	1
I got one of these due to my SE screen breaking after two years of abuse..... I always buy the cheapest NEW iPhone available, which happens to be the 6s at the moment, and the 6s is the same on the inside as the SE. The battery probably won’t last as long, but the screen is bigger and the volume much louder than the SE. For £299 for a new iPhone it’s a bargain!	1
Used iPhone but in good conditions, just some scratches on the back. Bought the 128GB model.Updated (16 April 2019)The iPhone is great! Although a bit old for 2019, but still no problem using it on a daily basis. The iPhone smoothly runs the latest version of iOS 12.2 brilliantly!	1
Still a great product. 2019 and more than happy with it	1
Excellent product. For the price at 128 GB it was a bargain. Let's hope that Apple don't pull the plug on its support. Just have to watch the battery charge and make sure I keep the screen clean.	1
My first iPhone and cannot fault it- I think the battery life is only am ghtly less than my S7	1
I got this for my son. He had dropped the previous phone, IPhone 5S and it never worked properly again. I was surprised how much better the 6 was from the 5. My son is very happy with the phone. It was delivered on time and well protected. I would recommend this phone and this supplier.	1
Great phone, easy to migrate.	1
The I phone is a great improvement on the Samsung I used to use.  Pleased with the fast delivery too.	1
Absolutely brilliant would buy again	1
Excellent!	1
Excellent as always.	1
Great	1
Phone is the same as the iPhone 6s Plus in the shop but more cheaper  it’s really good 🏼🏼	1
Excellent value for money in 2019.	1

I won't say much about the device, as there are many reviews elsewhere, but this device supplied by Amazon appears to be genuine and brand new with usual high quality delivery.I wasn't sure about the Plus size screen, and in reality it is marginally more cumbersome than a regular size, but I really like the bigger screen size and I think better battery life too. Fits easily in any of my pockets so no problems there either.	1
Really great phone. Love it.  Pity battery life isn’t a little longer.	1
The only thing I disliked about this item was the lead and plug to recharge the phone. It is very slow. But as I have my old one I use that so not a problem. Apart from that the phone is perfect, I have had no issues with it except that it needed the ios upgrading which means the phone has been sat on a shelf for a while. But that took me 10 minutes to sort out. The phone works perfectly well and the camera is far better than my old phone (iphone 5)  love the live photos. I was dubious buying it from Amazon but neednt have worried, it is fine and well worth the £349 I paid for it.	1
came in good time was exactly as described in great condition, just what I wanted	1
Perfect just what I wanted at an excellent price!	1
Perfect.	1
Great came earlier than delivers and great condition for the price thanks	1
Best phone I've ever had	1
Absolutely excellent phone. But you know that anyway.	1
Perfect. Just like a brand new phone.	1
Very pleased with purchase as described.	1
Really happy with it, would definitely buy second hand again.	1
Excellent	1
Very pleased. Thanks.	1
Beautiful 	1
iPhone XS features and quality worth it for the price. Not suggestible to upgrade from an iPhone X to XS but if not then worth an upgrade.	1
As expected	1
This is my second iPhone. My first was one of the early models, and I eventually switched to Android phones for quite a while. When this came out, I loved the increased usable screen area. I immediately purchased one and have loved everything about it. I upgraded to the 256gb model and have way more than enough storage to keep everything I want on the phone. The battery life really amazed me. I use the phone for both business and personal use, so it stays pretty busy. I have never had to recharge the phone before the end of the business day. And the recharge time is very short - it recharges from 20% to fully charged amazingly quickly. The camera takes great pictures. When zooming in, the definition is still perfect. The Face ID is wonderful. I use it for almost everything and it is very accurate, logging me in almost every time. The only times it doesn't seem to work is in low lighting, which only makes sense. Overall this is a fantastic phone, I'm glad that I spent the money, and I will never go back to Android.	1
Nice	1

I like how it looks.	1
The size and fastness	1
Go get your iPhone now is have the best quality and data 	1
Honestly imlike everything about this phone	1
I love it. Great phone. I’ve been away from iPhones since the 3GS so ya long time. I’m back and glad. It’s well designed and built. Works wonderfully. The guy who gave it one star that’s not fair you had a faulty device can’t blame the whole product. Be real. Maybe five stars is much but I have no complaints about the phone. My complaints or with iOS so can’t blame the device. Sleek look. Smooth function. Light and big exactly what I like.	1
The excellent experience of iphone brings me great happiness. It is the good nerve of life to record every day	1
I don't quite understand all the negative reviews.  I'm loving everything about this phone.  Face recognition works every time and I can't find any feature that doesn't work flawlessly.  No more fingerprint ID, I just have to look at it and only takes a split second.  6.1 display vs the 4.7 I had with my old phone.  I'm getting used to the new navigation methods, but once I learned them I think they are great and much faster.  No more home button, but who needs it!  I have researched the new features and if you do too, you will learn to love it.	1
I have been with my Carrier for >than 20years now, so it was natural for me to go to them to buy my new phone, the XR, 64 GB. Except for buying the phone directly from Apple (Different considerations at Apple, though at first glance, price seems lower than buying phone elsewhere), I choose to forgo the Apple deal for many reasons including: I prefer to keep my new device for as many years as possible v only one year that Apple encourages; I have an established relationship with my regular carrier, including established credit.I do not understand this phone only working with one carrier. That must be connected to being an Amazon purchase. To my knowledge you may purchase any of the XR phones/any color from multiple carriers. It is just that I am a frequent Amazon customer and so I thought I would focus on reviewing the actual product, even though I purchased it elsewhere.I am also astounded by the mixed, overly negative reviews of the XR on this sit!e! If you read outside reviewers, including one in Forbes, you will see just how highly this phone is recommended, especially for the price. Search for multiple professional reviews elsewhere, do no take my word for it.I am physically disabled and no longer drive. So I purchased this phone online and subsequently via a phone call. I looked at the reviews at my carrier’s website before picking it. The fact that EVERY single review on their site was 5-stars helped me make my decision. That, plus the “RELATIVELY lower” price of $749 v $1095 for the X was also a huge factor influencing my decision. As for the 64 GB, that is what I use on my iPhone 6 and iPad Mini 4. It works for me. Importantly, I got a great deal on my phone, the advertised $100, plus another $100 that I negotiated myself. My net cost was $549, plus tax.  Shipping  of the xr & the return of the 6 was free (and prompt) both ways.From my decision making process, I want to review the actual phone! This will be short because the xr is as advertised. The battery life, which is the best of ALL iPhones-which I read online from independent reviewers-is consistent with my personal experience with the xr. Having had iPhones forever, I am blown away by how long the xr’s charge lasts—that is, only 1/3-1/2 of the battery is used over 24-36 hours.As for negative considerations, I have identified two minor ones: In settings, where you set how long you want to keep the phone on before it automatically turns off, your only choices are 1-5 minutes. I prefer the 15 minutes on the iPhone 6; I also prefer the Sounds of the iPhone 6-for example, when my alarm rings, it sounds a bit thin or “tinny,” lacking some resonance. I suspect I’ll adjust to resonance issue over time. I have only had the phone for a couple of weeks.There are my own thoughts and observations. Overall, I highly recommend the iPhone XR. Additionally, the xr is a fantastic  value  when compared to other iPhones.	1

Dude, this fhone is godly. It hasn't died this whole year. Do yourself a favor and get this right now.	1
At first, I was skeptical about buying this phone. But once I bought it, I saved over $150! I'm going to buy 10 more of these phones and use the $150 I save from them to buy the iPhone XR.	1
Very happy with my purchase. Matte black iPhone 7 32GB in perfect condition. Packaging a little strange as the phone did not come with any accessories or SIM card but this was expected. Phone works great!	1
As advertised. Phone works great. Thanks!	1
great deal!!	1
This phone is amazing it’s like brand new! Came before expected shipping date! I got a better quality item then expected ( I bought the iPhone 7 Plus from wireless mall sales) I was expecting scratches all over the back but there’s only one scuff on the bumper of the phone that is easily covered up by a case. Everything works fine only issue is that it doesn’t come with headphones but that’s fine because I paid a great price! Would recommend buying from wireless mall sales I don’t know the quality of the other providers.	1
Happy with my purchase, I was weary I was going to get a fake iPhone, but it is indeed real. It was delivered earlier than expected. And I'm writing this review from my new 7 plus.	1
Great buy, happy I got this phone for my son..it looked brand new with charger and headphones working fine so far and unlocked as described. Happy buyer here.	1
Great device highly recommended	1
I loved everything about the phone. No scratches, blemishes or anything else. It was like a brand new phone.You guys shouldn’t miss your opportunity to get one.	1
I bought this phone for one reason only: game development. I work with Unity3d and wanted a S7 to do testing for VR and AR and it works extremely well. I did not need a sim card, but i had to get it unlocked which the local phone dealer was able to do with software.	1
Very nice Phone thanks for your quick shipping.	1
Buenas tardes, recibí el teléfono, al encenderlo y querer utilizar el chip de una operadora de Ecuador, el teléfono no reconoce el chip. Previo a la compra del teléfono, los comentarios indican claramente que el teléfono es desbloqueado. Cuál puede ser el problema?	1

I know conventional wisdom says start with the carrier and strike your bargain from there.  But I knew it would have to be an iPhone, and my wife, moreover, insisted I accompany her to the Apple Store for my birthday gift--any Apple phone I chose.I went in with every intention to to get an iPhone 6S, since the lack of a headphone jack strikes me as impractical if not preposterous.  After auditioning 5-6 models, I left the store with the iPhone 7 Plus. The decision was simple--based primarily on one single criterion: the quality of the SOUND of MUSiC played back from the onboard speakers.The sales clerk suggested I not dismiss the 7 too quickly on the basis of the headphone jack omission.  First, the phone comes with an adapter that can be placed over your headphone pin and plugged into the charging port (that helps, especially given the collection of headphones I've acquired).  More importantly, the iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone with: 1. stereo (2) speakers; 2. pretty good (for a phone) speakers.The clerk then fired up a busy superhero movie score on the 4-5 iPhones I was considering.  Not helpful.  The clerk suggested pulling up any tune I wished through the store's Apple Music Subscription.  I went with Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue,"" which begins with Bill Evans rubato piano, then goes into tempo with Paul Chambers' acoustic bass (on ""So What"") in a call-response exchange between bass and ensemble.Using the iPhone 6s, with a single speaker, the bass was all but absent (the store was quite noisy).  Moving to the iPhone7 Plus, Chambers' bass walked right out of the phone speakers and into my ear, each pitch identifiable along with string ""buzz"" and extra-musical ""fingering"" noise.  Suddenly the question of the headphone jack was rendered meaningless.  The combination of stereo sound plus slightly more powerful, larger speakers was all I would need to get maximum value from the phone.I'm a hobbyist musician (piano), and I no longer practice with a notated score. All I require is a player (and a piano) to learn a tune, and a device like the iPhone 7 Plus makes learning new tunes easier than ever.I'm also a photographer of sorts, and the wider lens for unprecedented clarity shooting with available light as well as a feature permitting razor-sharp focus on a subject in the foreground and blurred-out focus on figures in the immediate background struck me as more than a novelty.  With my 35mm film cameras (Pentax Spotmatics), I'd have to switch to an expensive, long and heavy zoom lens to achieve the same effect.I've read that Apple may be planning on a blockbuster iPhone 8 with an OLED (curved) screen.  I think I can leave the curves to Marilyn Monroe or a Cinerama production..  The 7Plus should last me and, though it's a tad big and cumbersome as a phone, it should be harder to misplace and/or lose than the previous half a dozen ""candy-bar phones"" were.  (I don't need more than 1GB for using the phone, but 128GB is enough to carry a generous supply of music tracks and space for making videos).Only problems: finding the best carrier for the least money and unloading three barely used cell phones (2 Jitterbugs and a Spark Aquos Crystal--good screen but artificially ""enhanced"" sound and barely accessible controls, if you can find them).	1

Coming from a regular iPhone 6, I really don't regret getting the Plus variant this time around, extremely loving the upgrade, and since im not an American resident, one of my biggest fears was that my phone will not come unlocked but the guys at City Mobile2007 we're really honest and assured me it was (and YES it was unlocked). Thanks so much guys. I had a great experience highly recommend this seller. (City Mobile2007)	1

A ++++++++!!!!!!!	1
I was full of doubts with this phone. Since have me been apple customer products for more than 15 years and for the first time i feel there was no difrence between the plus 6 . But now i have had some time with the phone using the beta 3 IOS and there is some good stuff. The camera just incredible it is beast .  The nice black color looks asewome .  The new home button it's different more kind of android phone.  And finally the speed wow i think it is faster that my macbook air 13 inch latest model .	1
Excelente like New Loviu NY fon	1

I bought this phone for my boyfriend expecting it to be slightly used possibly a few scratches here and there and also I was expecting to maybe have so problems with it.(being ‘refurbished’ as description says) BUT surprisingly what I received was not that!  We got a brand new never taken out of the box iPhone 6 I was pleasantly surprised.  It works great, the battery lasts a lot longer than his iphone7 that just recently crashed, and it was in pristine condition!  What more could you ask for!?! Not to mention, the T-Mobile provider (or whatever sub-brand service of T-Mobile) has great super cheap options for plans!  I was excited when I called to set it up hearing they had a $25 plan with unlimited talk text and 3Gs of data!  I don’t know ANY service with that cheap of service!!  I’m so glad I trusted amazon and bought this phone because it’s exactly what we needed!!!	1
Works like new , no signs it was used	1
Brand new phone locked to simple mobile. However, their plans are really affordable and has decent coverage in big cities.	1
Came exactly as described, except the left side of the screen was messed up. When we tried clicking the “ABC/123”button on the keyboard, and the “1/Q” button it wouldn’t work. We had apps on the second page of the home screen and it wouldn’t let us drag the apps to the left to move them to the first page. I called Amazon to inform them of the issue and they transferred me to an Apple representative. After having me download the lastest update and resetting the phone, it still wasn’t working properly. Apple said I could either send the phone to them to be repaired or take it to a local Apple store to be fixed. They scheduled me an appointment that evening with Geek Squad at my local Best Buy, since the closest Apple store was a couple hours away. Geek Squad was very friendly, and replaced the screen on my phone within 2 hours, which fixed the problem of not being able to touch the left side of the screen. It’s a really nice phone and everything works perfectly now. It didn’t cost me anything to have the screen replaced, so even though it was an inconvenience to take it to get fixed, I’m happy they were able to fix it and that it only took a couple hours to get the phone back. I bought this phone for my daughter, because she likes using my iPhone 7, and she absolutely loves this phone. When she is playing Minecraft, the phone loads fast and doesn’t lag, which is what made us decide to purchase a new phone.	1
