iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	Black and White	2	This is a good quality smartphone but there are some flaws to consider when.......	2018-12-10	"This is a good quality smartphone but there are some flaws to consider when buying this smartphone.The display quality is good, the camera quality is decent but far from the best available. The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and the Huawei Mate Pro 20 have far better quality cameras and cost less to purchase.The battery life on this smartphone is okay and you get a decent amount of use before requiring a recharge.The performance is good and reliable and the construction of this smartphone is nice and it has a combination of durable glass, surgical grade stainless steel and an IP68 waterproof rating.This smartphone has Advanced Face ID which can be used to unlock your smartphone, Log into banking apps and more. This feature works well and fast.Technical Data and Specifications:Operating system: iOS 12Processor: Apple A12 Bionic chip with Next-Generation Neural EngineMemory: 64GB internal StorageSIM type: Nano SIMScreen:5.8"" Super Retina HD OLED DisplayFull HD 2436 x 1125p - PPI: 458TouchscreenIP68 ratingTrue Tone display3D TouchFingerprint-resistant oleophobic coatingSupport for display of multiple languages & characters simultaneouslySensors:Face IDBarometerThree‚Äëaxis gyroAccelerometerProximity sensorAmbient light sensorCamera:Main: Dual 12 MP Wide-Angle / 12 MP TelephotoFront: TrueDepth 7 MPVideo resolution: 4K Ultra HD (60 fps)Quad-LED True Tone flash with Slow SyncCamera features:Dual 12 MP wide-angle and telephoto camerasWide-angle: f/1.8 apertureTelephoto: f/2.4 aperture2x optical zoom, digital zoom up to 10xPortrait Lighting with five effects (Natural, Studio, Contour, Stage, Stage Mono)Sapphire crystal lens coverBackside illumination sensorHybrid IR filterAutofocus with Focus PixelsSmart HDR for photosWide colour capture for photos & Live PhotosLocal tone mappingAuto image stabilizationBurst modePhoto geotaggingVideo:4K video recording at 24 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps1080p HD video recording at 30 fps or 60 fps720p HD video recording at 30 fpsOptical image stabilisation for video2x optical zoom, digital zoom up to 6xQuad-LED True Tone flashSlo‚Äëmo video support for 1080p at 120 fps or 240 fpsTime‚Äëlapse video with stabilisationCinematic video stabilisation (1080p and 720p)Continuous autofocus videoTake 8 MP still photos while recording 4K videoVideo geotaggingConnectivity:LightningWiFi3G, 4G readyBluetooth 5.0GPSNFC with reader modeDimensions: 143.6mm H x 70.9mm W x 7.7mm DWeight: 177GOverall this is a decent smartphone which works well and has durable construction but the price to value ratio is very bad value for money in comparison to other flagship smartphones available on the market currently. Also not long ago it has been exposed Apple have been providing software updates for customers with older Apple products in order to slow down performance of their Apple product, making customers believe they need to replace their Apple products with new Apple products.This scandal has been reported in the mainstream media and there are plans to bring a class action against Apple for this immoral practice. Many customers can not afford a replacement and would like their phone to last as long as possible and what you get is the manufacturer these customers trusted giving them updates to slow down their product and ultimately profit from it and there are privacy concerns and backdoor access issues with this smartphone.Thanks for reading my review I hope you found it helpful."
iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Nouman Khalid	4	Solid Performer	2018-12-04	"This phone came in perfect packaging, thanks to Amazon. The phone itself was bought for my wife, who loves it. The gold colour really does look very nice and you can tell the build quality is very premium. I think the face unlock is good but they should have kept the fingerprint scanner. But then again, maybe that is the way forward! The reason why I did not give the iPhone XS a 5 star is because I think it is overpriced, despite it's quality. But that's just my opinion. :)"
iPhone XS	256GB	Silver	Tatjana Kovacevic	5	"Excellent product, great quality!"	2018-12-08	Great product like every Apple. All people what writing bad stuff need to check reference and description of the product on Apple website and then decide to buy or not to buy. I was using iPhone 6s all this time and now buy XS and I love it. Friend of mine used 8-9 years iPhone and now he bought  Samsung because was cheaper than iPhone and he regretted. All this will understand iPhone lovers. You can‚Äôt compare this phone with Huawei.. it‚Äôs funny review who wrote that.
iPhone XS	64GB	Space Grey	John B.	1	No clarity on warranty	2019-02-19	Neither the microphone nor the speakers on this telephone work properly. More troublesome I don‚Äôt know how to get the warranty on it. Does it go to Apple? Nobody tells you
iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Bluntknife	5	Shiny. Gold. Expensive.	2019-01-30	"It is all of the things you come to expect from Apple. High quality, a phone that is more NASA than NASA. And very expensive. I'd still highly recommend Apple products, and no, I'm not an Apple fanboy. I'm sure the same could be said of the top end other smartphones."

iPhone XS	256GB	Silver	Nicky Lee	5	Best Phone on the Market.	2019-05-01	"Very expensive, but the best phone money can buy. I bought mine a few months ago on a special deal, I got a 256gb fir the price of a 64gb.Over the last few months this phone has obliterated anything thrown at it from intensive programs to 4K live streams, augmented reality it can handle anything, it is raw power. Battery life is poor, if you are a power user you will be out of charge within 6 - 8 hours. So keep that in mind. I‚Äôve dropped this phone on solid marble tiles and it didnt leave a scratch, they are durable, but take no risk, buy a sturdy case.It‚Äôs a great phone, the best money can currently buy, but wait for the prices to drop, because they are very expensive,l."

iPhone XS	256GB	Space Grey	Adam29	3	We‚Äôre stalling apple!	2019-04-30	Apple seem to be more about rushing out products to make more money than spending time make a decent product these days. The really to me seemed to have rushed out this iPhone the quality overall just doesn‚Äôt say apple!

iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Pablo CASADO ARENAS	5	Great little phone	2019-02-28	"I was getting tired of getting huge phones, and iphone xs is perfect size. it is also blazingly fast. Yes, it is not cheap at all, but bear in mind that you can resell for a higher price that you would resell an android, so, in the end, you are not throwing away all this money in a phone, since it has good reselling."

iPhone XS	64GB	Space Grey	C. Sanders	3	Impressive but big flaws	2019-05-06	"So you read all the reviews and they say how amazing this is but there are some aspects that seriously undermined this phone.Firstly the good.Performance - slickCamera - excellent and love the portrait (although it‚Äôs not a quick one to use)Battery - ok not amazing but better than previous versionsThe badThe screen - very bright but scratches like a CD. Never had a scratch on any of my previous 6+ iPhones but this one has many after a few months. Will seriously affect resale value.Face ID. Oh my god I hate it. Sooo slooow. Have to wait every time whilst it unlocks. Doesn‚Äôt work well in dark or with sunglasses. With finger print I did occasionally have to enter code but now I do it half the time. Reset my ID a lot but no different. It‚Äôs a nice gimmick but that‚Äôs all it is. Bring back finger print, please."
iPhone XS	64GB	Space Grey	Adam	1	Waste of money	2018-11-18	"Not very good don‚Äôt upgrade if your thinking about it, not worth 1K"
iPhone XS	256GB	Silver	Trevor	1	Iphone waste of money	2019-01-20	Iphones are over rated over price i never buy one i just bought Samsung Galaxy A9 has 4 cameras on the back each one 24mp starts with 180gb expendable to 512gb so bought the handset and sd card 512gb for 2 only paid ¬£550 that well under half price of an iphone Samsung android itself much faster using internet too takes seconds to use internet even very fast connecting to wifi

iPhone XS	256GB	Space Grey	Mr. D. J. WENZEL	4	Beautiful but fragile	2019-04-25	"At first I was not blown away, but after tweaking the settings and getting used to the new gestures, I‚Äôm a big fan.On the downside, after only a few months and a single low drop, I‚Äôve chipped the corner of the screen. Oh for truly tough screens..."
iPhone XS	256GB	Space Grey	RGomes11	5	Best iPhone Yet!	2019-03-03	"Really was unsure about the value for money with this phone as you can get more storage and performance for less money from other phone companies.However this little phone has really surprised me! Super quick and responsive, great to have a little more storage for photos etc. Camera performs really really well.Overall really pleased, fantastic phone. Would recommend for anyone who is an apple person :)"
iPhone XS	256GB	Gold	Julie	5	Great phone!	2019-05-01	"Had this phone for about 6 weeks now, what a great phone! I was still on an iPhone 6 (which I‚Äôve used for the past 4 years, that served me well) so this was an amazing upgrade for me. 256gb for under 1k is a good price, looks good, feels lovely, works fast, photos are excellent! Glad I made this purchase, would highly recommend if upgrading from any phone 3 - 4 years old!"

iPhone XS	64GB	Space Grey	Nikos S	5	Good but overpriced a lot.	2019-07-07	"It is a sturdy and quality phone you can feel it. It has perfect analogies size of the phone and size of the display, for people that do not want big phones but want clear view of the screen. But those qualities you can find them on iPhone x also and if someone does not care to have full display screen phone then in iPhone 7 without paying 1000 pounds or so. There is no value for money here."
iPhone XS Max	256GB	Space Grey	Craig Griffiths	5	Supersized Experience	2018-10-18	"First of all, the name of this iPhone is slightly confusing. XS Max. XS would normally indicate something that is extra small and max would usually suggest maximum size. However, there is absolutely no confusion about the quality of this product.If you look beyond the puzzling name, you'll be staring into the deep black depths of a stunning 6.5-inch OLED Super Retina display. Have you ever wanted to stare deep into the abyss of a black hole? Well, now you can for just ¬£1,249. I went for the Space Grey colour option, due to the mystery and unknown that is often associated with outer space.The battery life is fantastic so far, lasting around a day and a half with moderate use. As opposed to my previous iPhone 7, which lasted about as long as a typical Tinder relationship. Ironically, this app was not only detrimental to the battery life of the iPhone 7, but also as my actual life.This iPhone has been my first experience using Face ID. I now wish that I could unlock more things using my face.The A12 bionic chip is a marvel. I can now switch between apps and ignore my friends and family up to 15% faster than ever before. Additionally, with the dual SIM slots, I can now be ignorant at home as well as abroad.I have found the Screen Time App to be particularly useful. Not only does it pin point the exact time of day that I miss my ex-girlfriend, it also shows me exactly how addicted to this phone I really am.Overall, my verdict of the iPhone XS Max is this: it may not solve the inner torment and angst that we all go through as human souls. It is however, a lovely distraction."
iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Grey	Amazon Customer	5	Incredible phone	2018-12-18	At ¬£100 off at Amazon this phone is worth it.
iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Grey	JungleKing	5	It‚Äôs good but over priced	2019-01-18	It‚Äôs an Apple iPhone. Ofc it‚Äôs going to be a good phone. It is overpriced but that‚Äôs nothing new! Great phone tho. Best iPhone so far.

iPhone XS Max	64GB	Silver	Steve W	5	"Quality, as expected."	2019-06-20	"As far as I‚Äôm concerned there‚Äôs nothing I don‚Äôt like about this phone, apart from the cost of course, but it‚Äôs an Apple product so you would expect that. Just de-boxing the phone is a sensual experience to be savoured. Yes, it‚Äôs too expensive but I love it!I‚Äôve been used to an iPhone 6s and compared to that the battery life is unbelievable. Only had it a couple of days but I‚Äôve not got anywhere near needing to plug it in for a to up during the day. I‚Äôm sure it will go for around one and a half days of reasonable use. The camera is superb and I‚Äôve not experienced and problems so far with the facial recognition that is so much better than the fingerprint recognition. As for the home button - I though I might miss that and find myself desperately poking the bottom of the phone to switch back to home but I‚Äôve not done it once yet."
iPhone XS Max	64GB	Gold	sheniqua Taylor	2	Be careful Phone did not last 10 minutes before it ran hot	2019-06-17	"I don't know what happened here, the delivery was great, but for some strange reason after opening and fully charging the phone while i was trying to set it up the phone started to get hot not sure why but i was so hot i had to turn it off and left it for a bit, i used the charger it came with to charge so i don't know why it was running hot but it did. when i turned it back on to continue with the set up lol it got hot even faster. so yea i was left with maybe 30 minutes of the phone usage before i packed it up and drop it off to return by Hermes which was a whole terrible experience. I have not heard from anyone since it was return June 1, 2019, even the tracking information is f-ed up. So yeah if you want a phone that will work please just go to Apple it will be worth it trust me"
iPhone XS Max	64GB	Space Grey	tali20	5	Amazing phone	2019-06-02	Absolutely amazing phone. I switched from android after 4 years without an iPhone and it was so easy to get back into it.  It‚Äôs crazy how many things you can do with this phone.  Great for phone.  The battery is absolutely amazing

iPhone XS Max	256GB	Gold	E. Spinks	1	Not worth it.	2019-06-15	"Seriously not worth the money.Sure it's got an Apple logo but value for money wise. Appalling.For ¬£500 less can get a Samsung S10 with twice the storage and expandable.Or less than half the price an oppo7 with 256gig storage.And then the build quality, sure it looks nice but drop in on the sofa and the screen will crack.Apple doesn't care about it's customers any more, too many people see the logo and follow the pack. Open your eyes. Can honestly say will never go back to Apple."

iPhone XS Max	256GB	Silver	Amazon Customer	5	It's very pretty	2019-03-05	Beautiful phone expensive though
iPhone XS Max	256GB	Silver	PTZ	5	The biggest and best iphone ever has landed!	2018-09-29	"I have used the phone extensively at the Apple store as well as through my friend who bought one recently.What's in the box?‚Ä¢ Apart from the phone, Lightning EarPods, Lightning to USB cable, user guide and standard 5W Power Adapter are included.Screen -This screen is very good! Very crisp and vibrant. However, I feel the blacks are not as deeper to the naked eye. The maximum brightness level is very good. This is even more than the closest Android rival Galaxy Note 9.The size of screen is 6.5 inches diagonally. The resolution is 1242 x 2688 pixels. The notch on the top of the screen may keep people divided.Build Quality-Very good. In par with the iPhone X /Galaxy Note 9 and probably better than Google Pixel 2 phone. Non removable back.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, and the sterio speakers are more than adequate. Has NO headphone jack. There is no headphone jack compatible dongle either included,  but you can buy it easily.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag at all.Is the 4 GB RAM not adequate? I think it is. I found no lag in how the phone functioned, despite lower RAM compared to the Android counterparts.Added features-Micro SD slot is NOT available. This phone is water and dust (IP68) resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP DUAL lens back camera.Very good photos in good daylight. Good low light photos as well. The front camera is good at 7MP, but could have been better(may be a front flash next time?) Good for selfies but nothing compared to the back camera.The cameras are identical to iphone X on paper, but the end results are ever so slightly better and consistent. The low light photos are better because the pixel sizes are bigger.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good. But then it has to be bought through an authorised reseller.However, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon. You can purchase additional warranty through Apple care.Battery-Very good 3174 mAH battery. There is a quick charge function. But this is not as fast as the dash charge in One plus 5/6.You may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one day of use on this, if you are a moderate to heavy user.Operating System-Runs iOS 12 out of the box, and this runs brilliantly. Apple do the software side of things in a more mature way than Android counterparts including Samsung. The icons per se are much more mature than Samsung. iOS 12 is fluid and very easy to use. But iOS has its restrictions compared to Android, such as not being able to modify easily.Security features-Face ID works well and worked without an issue almost everytime I used it.No fingerprint sensor is available.Price-The recommended retail price at present is ¬£999 for the 64GB version of iphone Xs and ¬£1099 for 64GB version of iphone Xs Max, which is very steep. The RRP for the iphone Xs Max 512GB version is ¬£1449 though, and think before you buy , do you actually need that amount of storage on the phone?Colour-It currently comes in space grey, silver and gold. If you like a clean look, then Space grey is your option. It gives a more official (but probably boring, according to some) look. If you buy the I personally feel the Gold colour is very nicely done, and is not gaudy at all.Dual sim?Dual sim is available through an Esim.Is there anything else I would have wished the iphone Xs to have?1. Headphone jack. This actually may not happen ever. But the truth of the matter is a jacked headphone so easy to use, and does not need re-charging, hence I love it , compared ot a Bluetooth headphone2. Notchless display3. Bigger battery (yes, 4000mAH next year may be? :) and faster quick charge function )4.Slightly better low-light photo performance.This, or the iPhone X?iphone X has been discontinued, so if you want to buy it brand new it won‚Äôt be available. But in the second hand market you could get the iphone X for about ¬£400 less than Xs max, so if you don‚Äôt mind the size, iphone X may be a good option.So, you have the iphone X. Should you buy the Iphone Xs or Xs Max?On the surface, the iphone Xs is an incremental upgrade, and you may wonder whether you actually need the iphone Xs Max.But the short answer - yes you should probably still upgrade.Why?1. Iphone Xs has improvements such as slightly faster performance, better water/dust resistance (IP68 vs IP67), better camera for low light photos (see above for details) .2. One year down the line, the iphoneX will be valued at around ¬£200 if you want to sell and upgrade to iphone 2019 (which is about ¬£700 less than the RRP) and at present there are some good trade- in deals around for the iphone X. Hence, you probably would give your phone and upgrade for about ¬£350 more, which I feel is reasonable.3. You will also have the latest tech in your hands!But, the ultimate decision is yours :)If you have Iphone 8/8 plus, should you upgrade?Short answer- yes you should. There is plenty of reason.Any questions about the  iphone Xs/Xs Max, please ask and I will try to answer them to the best of my knowledge.If you feel the review is unhelpful, can you please say why in the comments below, so I can improve my future reviews. Thank you."
iPhone XS Max	64GB	Silver	SK	4	V.Good	2019-06-13	"Maybe not 5* for value for money because it is an absolute mammoth of a price.But user experience is very good, fluid animations and has reachability feature to allow easier one handed operational use.Battery life could be better, just not as long lasting as the s10+ which admittedly has a larger battery size. If your not a video user, it may be viewed as good battery for you.Coming from Android to iOS is tough because music and videos are not easy to get across, iOS is quite limited in that regard and requires iTunes to make this all possibleOverall, guaranteed iOS 13 and likely 14 so It‚Äôs also futureproof"
iPhone XS Max	512GB	Gold	ProductWarrior	5	Stupdenous	2019-06-08	"A really great device and certainly the best on the market right now, at the cheapest price too - Normally retailers charge ¬£200 for extra memory but Amazon don't, I bought this one as it has higher resale value and it really is a beautiful, great phone in the gold finish."

Notch at top not really bothering me although it is noticeable when full screen on movies or YouTube."

iPhone XR	64GB	White	Sal	5	Absolutely no need to go for the more expensive XS!	2019-03-02	"The phone is bigger than the XS but retains all the good stuff. It's a solid phone with incredible battery life. The camera is as good and only lacks the zoom lens, which most people never use anyway. The screen is great, with great accurate colours. I am not used to OLED however and like LCD as a whole.The phone itself is quite large and thick (the latter is great for battery life) so I would recommend seeing one in person before purchase. It sits in between the XS and XS Max sizes. It is a fractionally smaller in size than 6/7/8 Plus phones but with a larger screen due to small edges.I was most worried about 3D Touch but they added similar long-presses for most convenient 3D Touch actions. I am a heavy user of 3D Touch and whilst I miss it in some areas it covers most of my needs. If you don't know what 3D Touch is... then great! Even less reason to buy the XS or XS Max.Unfortunately at full price still not a cheap phone but it's definitely not a low-effort product."
iPhone XR	64GB	White	Eljay	5	Switched from Android to the iPhone XR and very happy	2018-12-24	"i've been an Android user for the last 6 years and just had endless problems and thought enough is enough and once i saw the XR and the specs, like everyone else i laughed and asked who would want this phone?  It wasn't until i went into the Apple Store that i saw the build quality and the screen and was blown away...how on earth is this screen only 828p? It looks sharp and gorgeous.I went for the White 64GB model which looks the best out of all of models in my opinion. The black front and the white back is like a storm trooper phone. Looks really nice and feels really nice in the hand. The new gestures are amazing, once you get used to them you can't go back. The phone is also so smooth and will stay smooth.The apps are of higher quality than i experienced on Android, Face ID is a revelation and a game changer. The camera is very good too, as good as a Pixel 3 (according to DXOMARK)All in all i'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend. if you are on an older iPhone or are thinking about switching over from Android then you won't be disappointed."
iPhone XR	64GB	Red	wayne	5	"Large, Clear, Functional"	2019-02-12	"I bought this for my son for a Christmas present.  Choosing between the smaller OLED and this larger LED was difficult, but as my son mainly uses it for watching videos, video chat, and messaging, the larger screen size won out.The image quality is still excellent (and that is coming from an Adroid fan) and the overall build is really good too.Battery life is really good - His 2 year old 6s? would hold a charge for < 1 day.  This one lasts over 1 1/2 with quite heavy usage.As Apple Phones go, this was a tad expensive, but an overall good purchase."
iPhone XR	64GB	White	J. R.Leeson	5	Almost perfect.	2019-02-27	"My partner bought this for me (much to my surprise) and although I've only had it for a couple of days I would recommend it.  Just a couple of points that might be of interest to someone/anyone and that is although I entered the face recognition in the phone it so far has not opened with this feature.  I still have to enter a code manually.  Also, there is no button at the bottom of the phone to press, but I guess this is just something I am used to with my old iphone 6 and it is merely personal preference."
iPhone XR	128GB	White	PA	5	A joy to use	2019-01-01	"Upgrade from iPhone 7 loving the new screen size, functionality, smooth transition to the new device overall a joy"
iPhone XR	128GB	Yellow	Robert Vogan	3	Purple hue on front camera	2019-02-28	Phone is completely fine except the front camera has some purple hue on it which has been like this since it arrived. I have requested a replacement but it‚Äôs just a bit of a pain to wait on it arriving and to post the old one back when I spent so long updating my content from my MacBook.

iPhone XR	64GB	White	Amazon Customer	5	"Great to use, unbelievable battery life (for an iPhone)"	2019-04-17	"Bought as a replacement for an iPhone 8, this is a useful step up. The larger screen makes a large difference to usability and is clear and bright. The FaceID works superbly, much better than TouchID. I am also really happy with the camera performance, the portrait mode works well. Overall a great phone and can use extensively during the day and still have 50% battery left which is a pleasant surprise."

iPhone XR	128GB	Black	McFlono McFlunilu	5	Screen is actually really good! Better than expected!	2019-06-17	"I'm absolutely delighted with that phone. Yes it is a bit expensive but it is definitely worth it. I had some reservations regarding the screen, people say it is not oled etc. but the screen is actually amazing, I have compared it to the Xs next to each and that‚Äôs the only time when you can spot a difference and the extra money for the XS is not worth it, when you also take in mind that you get exactly the same chip processor! Runs great and the battery life is really good, for a heavy user a day and a half is not a problems!"

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Shelley	5	Easy to use a great phone	2019-03-25	Upgrade from iPhone 6 with battery and other problems. This mobile is fast instinctive to use not too big and easy to transfer data via iTunes! As I am nearly 70 and managing technology easily and do not find the phone too large for small hands I am very happy with my choice and face recognition works really well

It is a fantastic phone and despite being worried about moving away from fingerprint recognition, I love the facial recognition!!!  I wish I had upgraded sooner to be honest!  I have gone from needing a charge twice a day (or more) to one every three or so days and even then, just to get it back to 100%!"

I no longer need to take my charger outside with me.The size took some time to get used to but enabling ‚Äòreachability‚Äô in the settings made it way easier. This allows you to swipe down on the home bar to bring down the top half of the screen.Apple should have left it on by default instead of making you turn it on by yourself. You can turn on reachability by going to settings > general > accessibility > reachability.
iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Carrotcruncher	5	Really great phone but probably a little overpriced	2019-01-07	"This is a great phone, the battery life is superb, the screen although just over 720 resolution is really good, putting it next to the 6s plus you really can‚Äôt notice any difference in face sometimes text actually looked a little better on the XR, the camera is also superb and really good in low light, it really makes shooting at night a pleasure, although some are saying it‚Äôs a downgrade I disagree, it is overpriced for what you get 599 would be a more realistic price, I got mine for that price thanks to a 150 quid voucher, even 650 would be a reasonable price but 750 is to much, unless of course you are rolling in cash in which case you would maybe buy the Xs plus, however that thing is huge, this phone at 6.1 inches is in the sweet spot as also the display is quite long the widths not much more that a 6s and it fits in the hand nicely and is nice to type on to without many typos, all in all a very nice phone and I am very very happy with mine"

iPhone XR	64GB	Red	John D Purley	5	Luxury iPhone Only Apple seem to get it so right!	2019-04-29	"I upgraded from an older iPhone 5s (which still runs all the apps I use but being in my 80s the small screen is now a bit of a struggle) so up from 4‚Äù to 6.1‚Äù and the XR is a beautiful upgrade in every respect.The A12 chip is about 5-6 times faster than the old 5S and has 200% more RAM, about 110% bigger screen area and with the 64gb version has about 50gb free space after system and apps etc. The stereo speakers are way above the anything you will find on the android phone and if like me you do not like using earphones this is a big bonus when listening to music or watching video etc.Face ID is a revelation!!! it was sharp and instant after setting up in the way required. I don‚Äôt miss the Home button at all. Just a flick of the finger takes you home, clears the screen of an app or brings back the apps you‚Äôve been using and so no buttons to press at all. It automatically logs you in securely to websites and accounts et cetera. Everything about it is so smooth and slick compared to the android phones I have used and setup for others. At first I did baulk at the price over the iPhone 7Plus (5.5‚Äù screen) which will probably be discontinued this year with the arrival of iphone 11. Battery life of the XR has over the last few weeks of light use consistently delivered better than 2 days and photos are superb.  One criticism is the camera protruding from the case. This is not justified, see photoOverall, looking at the latest spec and what this includes, I think whilst it may be a luxury phone for me I have no regrets about spending the extra. The Apple combination of hardware and software clearly wins over other makers recipes in the use of Android."

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Edward Lynch	4	A little too big for comfort	2018-11-23	"I‚Äôve had my iPhone XR a week now and I‚Äôm missing my iPhone 7!  Face ID works really well, but I still miss fingerprint unlock on occasion - usually when the phone is flat on a desk and I have to move and lean over it to unlock.The thing I can‚Äôt get over is the size, especially in a case. It is just a bit too big to pocket and forget about, especially in Jeans or trousers."
iPhone XR	64GB	Black	amageek	4	Heavy but all the best features	2019-04-04	"We all know apple products are overpriced and are often a little behind when compared with the competitor products, but I keep coming back to apple because it just works.iOS is dated in my view, but it does everything I need and it does it well and fast. The battery life is much better than on my IPhone 6 Plus. I play a lot of games on my phone and it still often lasts the day. My average screen time is around 7h.I wanted went for the XR because it has most of the nice features such as facial recognition (which works very well), a good camera and the same chip as the more expensive version. The battery life on this is supposed to be better than the other models but I only own the XR so can‚Äôt comment.It‚Äôs a bit thicker than I‚Äôd like and I would have liked the thinner bezels. Don‚Äôt understand why in this day and age apple are so far behind on the design, but for my purposes this phone is great. It is quite heavy though.  I do wish there was no notch either.I used to have an android phone and I‚Äôve tried all the latest Samsung‚Äôs. Android OS is buggy and crashes a lot, and I‚Äôm not convinced about the security. I‚Äôve got friends that just have to look at something and they are being sold and marketed to. The privacy settings seem better on apple.I do like the widgets on android though but I prefer the IOS versions of the apps which just seem to be smoother and work better."
iPhone XR	128GB	White	Matt	4	Very good battery life and performance.	2019-04-07	"This is a great iPhone. The (close to) edge to edge screen is great for video and the stereo speakers are fantastic. Speakers are an area where Apple are really excelling in their mobile and laptop ranges. The LCD screen isn‚Äôt noticeably worse than an LED if you‚Äôre the type who dims it to save battery life anyway, which incidentally is better than any iPhone I‚Äôve had in recent years. On low power mode, you could push it out for almost two days on light use. The camera is very good, although the portrait mode will look noticeably fake to any photographers who have shot with real low depth of field. It‚Äôs a shame this doesn‚Äôt have 3D Touch or a fingerprint sensor, but the phone still performs well. Build is great and as usual for a modern iPhone, it‚Äôs waterproof enough to survive most household accidents. But the compromises to make a cheaper iPhone means that unlike the thundering specs of iPhones like the 7 which beat most of the competition, there‚Äôs a lot of cheaper Android competition with a better spec on paper. Some much cheaper from the likes of Honor. If you‚Äôre agnostic as to which OS you like, shop around. But as an iPhone, I have no real complaints."
iPhone XR	128GB	Black	Amazon Kunde	5	I think the beat iPhone so far and looks stunning	2019-02-20	"Just a quick rundown previous phones ,I had all iPhone till the 8plus and sold my iPhone XI wasn‚Äôt going to pay over 1000 for a phone so got the pixel 3 to try out,returned other than the photos the phone for me had bad battery and log of glitches,so got a deal on the car black 128 gb Absolutely love it in every way screen to me is excellent ,camera still really good and the battery less about 2 days seriously surprisingly great phone"
iPhone XR	64GB	Black	ken	5	Right sized iPhone!	2018-12-15	I upgraded from the 7 plus. I don‚Äôt  fancy plus sized phones anymore. The XR is the right size for me. The XS was too small for my liking. The battery life is the best I‚Äôve seen  in a smartphone. The screen even though had a lot of negative reviews prior to its release is actually good. I think the 128 GB has more value for money.

iPhone X	256GB	Silver	MD007	1	Beware this may be a used phone pretending to be a new one	2018-12-30	"I would put a zero star rating if allowed.  I bought this a gift, only to find that during set up that the iPhone had already been owned by 2 other people with their IDs still hidden in the phone.  Apple support that nothing can be done to remove them from the phone without the password for those accounts - clearly that is never going to happen.  So I am now going to have to take this gift back and send it back to Amazon.  Hardly Christmas.  Completely unacceptable."
iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	TJ	4	"A solid phone, but an eyewatering price"	2018-10-19	"It's a truly great phone, at a grossly inflated price. You would be foolish if you didn't think a large amount of what you are paying for is branding. Yes - you do get a lot of tech with this. And I find that even though some other phones are technically superior the iPhone seems to run better HOWEVER this is nearly one thousand pounds. That is a big investment - more than a laptop. If you can afford it, it won't disappoint but it's defiantly not that much better than the older versions which are 2/3 of the price."

Cold weather + gloves, not a problem anymore! Touchless payments is also great to have if I forget my wallet at home. Haven't had a single issue so far. Very fluid OS.The ONLY nuance is if you want to listen to music or something and charge your phone, which you can't do unless you either buy a wireless charger or use bluetooth earphones. Or you risk it and buy a 3rd party adapter to charge and use earphones but I don't feel comfortable doing that.Really useful having the 256GB.

iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Dr. Jonathan S. Warren	5	A great improvement on my previous 6S	2018-03-31	Was initially a bit wary as the price was significantly below the Apple price. Item delivered on time and brand spanking new. A great improvement on my previous 6S. I had considered buying in the USA but although with this retailer more expensive than in the USA much better than standard price in UK and it is 100% legit and no worries with customs!
iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Alison Callaghan	5	ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!	2018-03-11	"I‚Äôm very, very impressed with the iPhone X. I always thought my 6S Plus had a great camera but, my goodness, the camera on the X is amazing!Was a little unsure whether I‚Äôd manage the Face ID and missing home button but I honest had no problem with them, right from the start. The Face ID is excellent and even works in the dark or when wearing a hat/sunglasses etc.The difference In weight to my older 6S plus is unbelievable even though the screen is slightly bigger (the bezel takes my up much of the height on the previous edition) and I find it so much easier on my wrists.Battery life is far superior than previous modes and the biggest difference, for me, aside from the much-improved camera, is the clarity and colours of the display. Everything just pops on the X.I had previously seen reviews where the camera ‚Äònotch‚Äô had been annoying people. I can honestly say this hasn‚Äôt been a problem for me and the only kind of ‚Äòcomplaint‚Äô I have is that some app creators haven‚Äôt updated their apps to be used on the full screen X yet so you get some having a black bar at the top and bottom. Not much of a complaint but not as aesthetically pleasing as the apps which fill the entire screen.I would thoroughly recommend this phone if you have the budget!"

iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Kenny Maciver	1	Two replacement iPhone X's in 2 weeks ; Big Unresponsive screen Issue	2019-01-21	"I got an iPhone x at Xmas but began using it two weeks ago. On the second morning 15 mins after taking it off the overnight charge, the phone froze with the little spinning wheel in the middle of the screen. It rebooted itself, a process that took 10 minutes. It did the same on the second, third and fourth day, then on the fifth it did not reboot and the screen was totally unresponsive. Calls would still come in and the phone would buzz but not ring but could not be answered. Took it back to Vodafone and they replaced it.The same thing happened with the replacement and Vodafone admitted that they were experiencing similar problems all over the place. In fact the call centre lady said they must have received a bad batch and she herself had just decided to go for an alternative to the iPhone X. I happened to be in London on Saturday and took my dud phone to the Apple store in Covent Garden. Technician ran diagnostics which showed a power failure and he admitted that they were having serious issues. he kindly replaced the phone there and then.It is now Monday and horror of horrors the little spinning wheel showed up this morning, with the phone rebooting itself. I guess it will happen again tomorrow and on Thursday/Friday it will be dead again, just like the other two.The brand is getting damaged. Very expensive phone to buy that has a major screen issue. Can still use it for accessing the internet on my iPad!! The good thing is that it gets replaced with no issues and I could now write the manual on how to transfer data across from my old phone. Come on Apple we deserve a better product for this price."
iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Abz	4	There‚Äôs no such thing as a PERFECT smartphone..	2019-05-25	"I have used every single iphone from the 4s, up to the x (my current daily driver). Ill briefly outline the pros and cons in my daily usage: Sound quality is stellar. Cant complain there, with dual speakers i find myself lowering the volume alot ! Screen brightness is blinding and vibrant in its highest set. Image quality is crisp and clear, as are photos taken with the dual lenses. Speed is phenomenal in any task thrown at the device. It does not lag or stutter! Its truly a powerhouse of a phone. Calls don't drop in my use, and call quality is brilliant, even on loudspeaker. For average users, 64gb is just right and a challenge to fill up. The build quality is premium and looks the price, with a gorgeous finish. The only negative issues are battery life (which is iphone standard) and the price. Its a very expensive device even today, which some may find difficult to justify."

I have contacted Apple who told me that I have to contact the seller, and amazon told me I have to contact apple. It‚Äôs very unfortunate this has happened with me and I do not want to keep the phone. It‚Äôs best to buy straight from Apple."

iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	B Newton	3	Great iPhone - but please read review for why it only gets 3 stars!	2018-01-24	"Great product, great iPhone, massive improvement on all the other models I‚Äôve used. Fast and responsive, everything works great and Face ID is pretty amazing, saves time when using Apple Pay and logging into secure apps/websites.However... I had to return and get replacements for THREE iPhone X‚Äôs before I landed with one that didn‚Äôt have hair, dust or other foreign particles trapped on the inside of the glass covering the rear camera lenses. Yes, inside - no amount of wiping with a cloth will remove it as it‚Äôs under the glass. So, obviously a manufacturer defect where I assume it is not sealed in a dust and contaminant-free environment. Fourth iPhone replacement had nothing trapped under the glass and is perfect. For the cost of this product I don‚Äôt think you should expect anything less than perfection, so please do inspect your device thoroughly! :)"

Motherboard overheating within a month, screen repairs being ¬£280 with other damages up to ¬£556, camera lens after camera lens cracking, iris scanner not working and if Apple can't repair your phone in warranty you don't even get a new one you get a refurbished one. Avoid this phone at all costs please, it is a waste of money just try an S9 out or even the new Huawei (Hew-Way) phones are doing it on par with less issues and less cost."

iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Ibraar	5	"WebOS reborn - the most beautiful, elegant, intuitive, user friendly, stable OS on the best hardware"	2017-11-17	"This is WebOS reborn and good riddance Home Button - after using this you won‚Äôt ever go back to such a clunky unintuitive way to do things again - WebOS was doing this in 2007 - with the X Apple has caught up at last and in doing so has left every other present (Android and iOS) offering left for dead.(Watch some YouTube videos of iPhone X and WebOS comparisons - remarkably similar - took Apple 10 years to catch up)I won‚Äôt much go over how gorgeous the hardware is - that‚Äôs evident.- I mean just look at it and handle it.I have the 64 GB silver - which is the most attractive version. The back of it glows - it‚Äôs beautiful to behold and wonderful to Handle and use - couple it with the Spigen Clear case - don‚Äôt hide the elegance and beauty - and those cases protect well using advanced materials for under ¬£8. (In 5 years I‚Äôve never damaged a phone when using the Spigen Clear).The screen is bigger than that of an iPhone Plus - but the handset is regular iPhone (6,7,8) sized - a tad bigger but hardly noticeable in the hand - and yes, unlike the iPhone Plus you can use this more or less one handed.The build quality is impeccable - it really is a premium device - the touch and feel - materials used -  the screen pops at you (the ‚Äònotch‚Äô has the cameras and is a design feature which reminds me of the bite taken out of the Apple - it differentiates your device from a common or garden Android cross breed) and the speakers are evidently louder and fuller with more range of sound and resonance than normal mobile phone speakers - so you can actually listen to music on it. (I wonder how the built in sound DSP DAC compares and fares in tests?)Battery life is the best I‚Äôve seen on a  smartphone - a whole day of heavy use and by midnight I still had 40%.Reception and call quality again is as good as you can get.The hardware is gorgeous and coupled with the advanced internals you the have best handset on the market.But gorgeous hardware isn‚Äôt what makes a phone great - that‚Äôs the OS - and a modern OS should be user friendly, intuitive, beautiful to look at and a joy to use - it should also be fast and stable - so no annoying crashes or screen lock ups - this flies through every test and is a pleasure to use.Firstly Face ID - works more efficiently and more responsive than the finger sensor - works even in the dark and early morning with curtains shut and face screwed up - also effortlessly works with the browser, App Store purchases and other apps - and most apps have been updated to use this plus the gestures and screen of this iPhone X.The OS is a killer - the removal of the home button is a massive plus feature which turns a clunky device into magic - leaving any half baked  Android offering eating dust.iOS 11 on the iPhone X is WebOS 2017 - to think that Palm was so far ahead of its time - it built the most elegant and intuitive mobile phone OS back in the noughties - it‚Äôs give or take what the experience on the iPhone X is today.The iPhone X is beautiful to use intuitive  gesture based card system more of less as was WebOS - switching apps? Swipe across the bottom - closing apps? Gently touch and Swipe a card up  - switch apps? Swipe up and select the cards - and it multitasks properly - the camera and YouTube will run in card form (as on the WebOS TouchPad and Pre 3) - using every part of the screen to good effect - swipe from top right - from top or bottom reveals other features - and all fast responsive and with not a single crash or screen lock up in sight.I always hated the home button - coming from WebOS and HP Touchpad the iOS of the day was clunky and unintuitive - I noticed over the years how the iOS versions slowly morphed into what WebOS was - the morphing is complete with the dropping of the Hone Button and an adoption of an elegant intuitive card gesture based system which is a pleasure to use - the iPhone X is the best handset in the market and with the new iOS version it‚Äôs clearly the most beautiful intuitive elegant and user friendly - most stable and effortless OS on the market.A winner - thank you Apple and thank you Palm WebOS."
iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	tactless (no tact)	5	Amazing!	2017-11-12	"‚Ä¢ BLACKS: blacks look properly black. Unlike LCD, they don't even light up the pixel.‚Ä¢ HOME BUTTON GONE: you have to swipe up instead. I like this because it goes straight to the home screen, because while you're doing it, Face ID unlocks the phone in the background.‚Ä¢ TO SWITCH APPS: just keep your finger on the screen after you swipe up. You get a subtle haptic feedback and then you get the apps presented to you as ""cards"".‚Ä¢ NOTCH: It's actually tiny, and you really do stop noticing it.‚Ä¢ CAMERA: optical stabilisation now also works on the telephone lens. It's superb.Overall, the phone is such a delight, you overlook the minor shortcomings:‚Ä¢¬†COLOUR SHIFT: the whites seem blue-ish when you tilt the phone a bit. (Very slightly.)For people who are stuck in their ways: just get the iPhone 8. It has almost the same technology and you get to keep the home button. The iPhone 8 is still a great phone!‚Ä¢ PRICE: It's very nice but i feel it's overpriced at ¬£999 [Do not pay over ¬£999 for the base model! I note that on this page they are taking the piss!]UPDATE 2018.05.02================‚Ä¢¬†FaceID is a nice effort, but in my opinion nothing beats Touch ID 2 (as found on the iPhone 6 / 7/ 8).‚Ä¢¬†I get that there's no room for Apple to put the TouchID sensor, due to reduced bezels.‚Ä¢¬†It's annoying that the gestures are not now consistent between iPhone X vs iPad (& iPhone 7/8/SE)"
iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Scotty	1	Why Apple?	2018-05-01	"The IPhone was doing well up untill the 6S and was beating Samsung but not any more...Apple are verry good business people and could stick there name on anything and people would still buy it like the Air Pods! See just buy removing the headphone Jack they want you to spend more of your money.The question you are wondering ""Is this phone really worth ¬£1000?"" NO IT ISN'T!Here are the reasons why-1) It says it has the best display on a phone yet it isn't as good as Samsung displays from the S7 onwards. Even worse why did they cut some of the screen out for the notch when they should of just placed it above in all black so you atleast get the whole screen when you are watching videos.2/3) Crap Battery life compared to phones half the price of this! Also your gonna constanly need a power bank but that means you can't use headphone when charging so you will have to use bluetooth earphones that won't last as long as normal earphones.4) The dual Camera looks like a rubbish version of Wall-E5) It will slow down next year with an even worse battery meaning you will have to buy another ¬£1000 Phone.If you have sense just don't buy it!"

I live in Belgium (europe) and therefore there were some things about the iphone ( it is a korean model, watch out for that) that dind't work as I wanted. Asian country's have a privacy law that states the shutter camera sound should always be on, that bothered my too much. But don't get me wrong! The iPhone was in perfect condition, everything in the original box and everything worked. U can perfectly use it in europe or elsewhere, i's just things like the shutter sound, if you're not bothered by it it's perfectly usable!

iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Vasant kumar singh	5	Love it !!	2019-01-06	"Went for this over the new iPhone XS. Decided to not go with a contract so paid upfront. Feels solid in the hand, bigger and slightly heavier than my previous iPhone 8. Feel premium and butter smooth to operate. Face ID is quick and I don't miss the fingerprint mechanism a bit. Feels like you look at an app and it just opens. Can easily get a days worth screentime, as I am not a heavy phone user. Mainly for conference calls on Skype at work for which I use my phone and wireless earphones. Love with the display. It is just brilliant. Not overdone like the Samsung galaxy s9 my wife owns where it starts to feel unreal. Also pairs well with my Macbook Air as I have had both these devices since 2011, so couldn't really come out of the Apple eco system. All in all a good buy!"

iPhone X	256GB	Space Grey	Vitor Fernandes	4	Great phone but way overpriced	2019-02-20	"I got lucky to get this much cheaper than normal price, got a straight swap for my galaxy s9With that said, I would never pay over ¬£500 for this phone, neither the galaxy s9 for that matterI have used almost all iphones since the 3gs, and Ive used a few xperias, and a few galaxiesPROS - Face id is the most unbelievable tech I've ever seen, its magic, it works, I've never had any face recognition on any device working before. The thing is crazy, it works in less than a second, from any angle, from any light condition, with or without my glasses, its actually quicker than the time it gets me to swipe to unlock the phone. To the point I had to double check it it was activated.- Display is nice, I love the true tone, but somehow I think the galaxy s9 display looks a bit better- A huge advantage over the s9, the auto brightness works perfectly, I never ever had to adjust it, it was the same with s9 until the new android 9 which was driving me mad, I had to adjust at least 5x per day.- I love that you don't accidentally press the edges when using- I love that you don't have a pointless bixby button, instead you get a very very useful sound off button- 256gb of internal memory is more than plenty, no need to buy an extra sd card- I like the form factor.DISADVANTAGES- I already miss the notification light- There is no way to remove the screen to the left of the home page- No always on display clock- Sound quality is not as good as S9, specially with quality headphones, which is even worse than my previous s8- No headphone jack, sorry apple but I don't do Bluetooth, I like audio quality- I hate that I cant choose how many rows of apps to have on the home screen, I don't need 6 rows, I don't even have that many apps on my phones- No USB-c, which is more common with many devices including Apples own laptopsAll in all, I'd say the X and the s9 are on the same level, galaxy because of audio, and iPhone because of face id.UPDATE - I just got an Xperia XZ, my 8th phone this year, and will be my last one too, finally I found the perfect phone, has way better audio than the iPhone X, has notification light, has headphone jack, SD card, dedicated 2way camera button, pictures look nicer once you chose 23megapixel in the options,  its more comfortable to hold and has nicer colours/display, has clearer voice call audio too, not to mention it cost 1/10th of the price of an iPhone X. It cost me 80 on ebay."
iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Scott Taylor	4	Great phone but not worth the money	2018-04-20	"I have had the iPhone X now for about 6 months and despite loving it, I regret buying it! Simply because of the cost.Whilst the phone feels great in the handle, offering a premium feel but in a palm friendly size the innovation from the iPhone 8 doesn‚Äôt justify the price. Sure you have Animoji, which I‚Äôve used about 5 times but all in the first few days to show my kids. The only real innovation I feel is with the display and the face unlock. The display is good! Is it the best? No.. there are better out there but it is a big improvement of previous iPhones. Face unlock I do think is great, works everytime and I like the fact it works with pretty much all apps that would need fingerprint id. Apple Pay is a bit fiddly sometimes but most part ok. Apart from this it is just the same as any other iPhone!As for build quality... it‚Äôs great... BUT!! Definitely recommend a case as the frame of the phone scratches just by looking at itSave your money and get the 8 which is what I wish I‚Äôd done"
iPhone X	64GB	Silver	Eolake	5	Real improvements.	2018-05-06	"So re how good is iPhone Ten... When I‚Äôd bought it, I was a bit hesitating about it when people asked me. I thought maybe I‚Äôd wasted my money a little.And I will say that I think that the only *dramatic* advantage is the size. A large screen on a much smaller phone than previously. I love that.But also, since then I‚Äôve noticed things in comparison with my iPhone 6S+. It is actually quite noticeable improvements.One of them is the speaker. It is good enough to use to listen to podcasts and audiobooks when needed. On the 6, the bass is much more noisy, so male voices do not sound great at all, quite grating.Another, which I‚Äôd not seen coming, is the glass surface. I wonder how they have done it, but there must be some new treatment, because it is way less receptive to finger prints. I barely ever need to wipe it, it‚Äôs great. I wish my iPads had that surface.(I also wish all the devices had better anti-reflection coating, why don‚Äôt they?)Also, the colors and contrast of the screen are amazing. When the phone restarts in a dark room, I can cover the white Apple logo, and the black background is not visible!Also the camera is improved even beyond the addition of a ‚Äútele‚Äù camera (actually it‚Äôs a Normal lens, the old one is a clear wide-angle).  The only A/B test I‚Äôve made is night-time video, but the X blew the 6 out of the water there.None of these are must-have for most people, but it is clear that a lot of work goes into improving everything on the phones, and I think goes a ways to justify the admittedly high price for the X.And as a side-note, I have no doubt that as a business tactic, the high price is the right thing for Apple. They have to position it as a premium product, and it would not seem so if it cost only the same as the previous phone."
iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Ryo	5	great service from the seller	2018-06-26	"Firstly, great service from the seller. Dispatched straight away and arrived the next day.The phone came just as described (purchased second hand) works perfectly, couldn't be happier.My previous phone was an iPhone 6, compared to the Iphone X is like night and day. Especially when playing games or apps that demand a high processing power. Awesome phone."

iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Luke	4	"Amazing phone, but..."	2018-01-16	"As much as I love the phone, the reason I drop it one star is because of Face ID, the price and the front camera. Genuinely overall coming from an iPhone 6, this has felt like a pretty decent step up, but it comes at a huge price. I won't go into all the positives, as the other reviews do this phone justice (speed, quality, back camera are all amazing). But I just want to point out things to be aware of if you're tossing up this phone against others.My main 'negatives' are:- Having had the phone for over a month, I don't think the price is justified - weighing up all the features etc. it does not do something revolutionary enough to justify the ¬£999+ price tage- You need a case, and a good one at that! The phone is entirely made of glass, my friend has already broken a corner in less than a month - don't get a thin case, get a proper one if you want to actually protect it (also insurance)- Face ID is annoying, and you don't get used to it in a few hours, as I've seen mentioned. It doesn't always recognize your face, so it's a lot slower than fingerprint. It works perfectly when you're facing the phone directly (so when using Apple Pay or authorizing app downloads) but not great when you're lying down, have your phone on your desk or right below you etc.- And finally, the front camera is disappointing. Because the back one is so good, I expected the front one to have had massive improvements too, but it hasn't. I can barely notice a difference between the iPhone 6 and X front facing cameras.Having said all of this I would still recommend the phone to hardcore iOS users, otherwise if you can handle having a bigger handset, get the cheaper iPhone 8 Plus. The camera is just as good, screen too, and better value."

iPhone X	256GB	Space Grey	PTZ	4	"The best iphone out there, but is it worth the asking price?"	2017-12-14	"Screen -This 1125 x 2436 pixel screen is very good. Very crisp and vibrant. .The maximum brightness level is very good. Makes it legible in sunlight .The size of screen is 5.8 inches diagonally.The famous ""notch"" in the screen is well talked about. I personally don't like it, but Apple have used it in a way where it does not obstruct your viewing pleasure.Build Quality-Very good. In par with the best. Non removable back. The lack of headphone jack carries on from the previous generation.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, specially for a phone. Not as powerful as the dual speakers of some other phones.But then its in par with the Samsung Galaxy S8 series and Iphone  8 plus.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag at all. Have not had any issues so far with sluggishness or re-starts etc. These phones have lesser RAM than the android counterparts, but this does not show in day today performance.Added features-Micro SD slot is not available to expand memory. This phone is water and dust (IP67) resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP DUAL lens back camera.Very good photos in good daylight. Very good low light photos, and no notable difference from the Samsung Galaxy S8 series. The front camera is good at 7MP, but could have been better(may be a front flash next time?) Good for selfies but nothing compared to the back camera.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good.However, if the phone fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon.Battery-Very good 2716 mAH battery. There is a quick charge function as well as wireless charging. But this is not as fast as the dash charge in One plus 3s /One plus 5. This is definitely faster than the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 / Galaxy S8 though.You may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one day of use on this, if you are a casual user.Operating System-Runs iOS 11.1.1 System is slick and easy to use.Security features-Facial recognition- fast and slick, but still needs improvement.Colour-Comes in black and ceramic on the back. I like the ceramic better, since it gives a unique look.Single or dual sim?This only come in a single SIM version.Is there anything else I would have wished the iphone to have?1. Stereo speakers2. fingerprint scanner placement (inbuilt to the screen)3. Bigger screen4. Bigger battery and faster quick charge functionShould you buy S8 /S8+ over this ?its a personal choice. The S8 would be cheaper at this point. Otherwise both phones have similar functionality. But honestly, wait for the S9 if you are in doubt, it's probably just 3 months away.This, or the Iphone 8 plus?If you want the latest and the greatest, go for this. I personally prefer this to the Iphone 8.Price-At ¬£999, this is one of the priciest phones out there.I personally feel this is overpriced for what it is, hence 4 stars. ¬£899 would have been a better price point. The Iphone retains a lot of resale value though. This time next year you could probably sell it for around ¬£500.When buying through third parties look at the following-Is it new or used?Are they locked/unlocked?Has it got a decent warranty (most of the time, Apple does not cover phones bough through third parties) ?Do you get all original accessories with box?"

Fitting has some benefits over previous models where dog hairs seemed to manage to get under the screen cover. ButAnd this is a massive butThe buttons need so much pressure to push them. The off button takes both hands and I‚Äôm far from weak.The cover for the charge port is very hard to get open and even harder to close.I‚Äôm sure it adds to the water resistance but it‚Äôs majorly impacting usage.I‚Äôd return it but I don‚Äôt know who else‚Äôs to buy
iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Am@z0n Cust0m3r	5	Great expensive phone!	2018-02-26	"You think the price is high but what you get is worth every penny!!!!! The pictures are better than 35mm camera with zoom lensThe X model looses the Home Button and doesn‚Äôt have a the headphone jack like the 7‚Äôs. No big deal on the headphone jack. Sometimes I do prefer plugging a set in and not having to worry about Bluetooth.The lack of a Home button does take some time getting use too. It is really different with the swipe gestures but after a day or so you get use to it. Basically learning a new way to switch and X out of apps. I like it now after using it.If you can afford it, you will be happy.The Face ID works really well. This is the first of what will be new technologies for Apple like the Face ID, this was probably rushed and the next version will be more secure and work better. But it seems to work fine right now and does take the place of the finger ID pretty well.Camera takes awesome pictures.Pleased so far and looks like a solid reliable phone. The main thing I like is the larger screen which is gorgeous and the faster processor. I love the phone but honestly I could have waited a year for the next model. If you can afford it now you‚Äôll enjoy it. The size is perfect for me and the screen is awesome.Get a good case to protect it with which also hide the gorgeous design. I never really saw the iPhone 7 in black that I had because I always had it in a heavy duty case to protect it. It‚Äôs a shame to hide such great looking devices but you kinda have to so they don‚Äôt get dinged up."
iPhone X	64GB	Space Grey	Ryan Knight	3	Lovely looking phone that burns its screen	2018-06-18	"Good phone that Apple needed to release! It's the 'newness' that creates the hype for this device but it has one major flaw: it's screen. Yes, the SCREEN can, and will, eventually suffer from 'burn-in,' which is a permanent ghosting effect of picture elements that remain or ""burn"" into the screen thus creating an unsightly look - see pics that I took of the phone from a very popular phone shop...I've seen a good number of these iPhone X's with burni-in.Here are the phone's good & bad points...POSITIVES:+ Good camera = great photos+ Great build quality, with a design & fit for a great feel in the hand+ Good sound from stereo speakers+ Reliable connectivity for WiFi, Bluetooth & mobile data+ The phone is waterproofNEGATIVES:- No Home Button, which takes some getting used to- Gestures can be a bit confusing at first & can be executed by accident- Face ID a bit cumbersome at times & not 100% reliable when wearing sunglasses- (Still) no expandable storage via micro SD card- AMOLED screen suffers from BURN-IN after a while. Sure it looks beautiful but hey check my photosSo, if one likes to keep their screen at full brightness they will eventually see screen elements (icons or text) permanently 'burnt' into the screen. Give it 18 months or more & sure enough, issues will arise.BOTTOM LINE: a great phone ruined by an OLED screen (when it burns in)I WOULD NOT recommend this phone to people who keep their phone/s longer than 24 months.However, I WOULD recommend this phone to people who upgrade their phone every 12 to 18 months, as chances are the screen will still look great üëç"

iPhone X	64GB	Silver	TheMC	4	Apple pay and face recognition aren‚Äôt smooth.	2019-05-07	"I switched back to iPhone after trying a OnePlus, which was amazing but too big for me (and the sound quality not as good).The iPhone X is a perfect sized phone for my small hands. The mic / sound recording (with and without the original earphones) is the best I‚Äôve seen on any phone.I‚Äôve dropped it quite a lot and it has yet to break (I have a sticker on it and a screen protector but no silicone case).I would say if you use the camera and mic a lot, it is worth the bucks, as is my case.However, if you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not sure it is. Androids are much more customisable, google pay is a lot smoother than apple pay (if you double press the power button it comes up, so I keep doing it accidentally, and takes more time to do it deliberately when trying to pay, vs androids let you do it with just a touch). The face recognition is nowhere near as good as my old OnePlus‚Äô, and you still have to swipe up, so it‚Äôs never a truly hands free experience as the OnePlus is. Also there‚Äôs no fingerprint scanner so if it doesn‚Äôt recognise you, you have to type your code in.In summary, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good phone if you have the same priorities as me. If not, androids are a lot more fun and customisable (and cheaper)."

I loved the Apple ecosystem from the MacBook and Handoff is a very useful feature. The integration of iOS and macOS is hard to match.The battery life seems to be less than the iPhone 7 which I also purchased so I had to keep charging it in at least half a day with how much I use it. It‚Äôs not a huge deal as I got a power bank too. But it‚Äôs a bit annoying.Performance by the bionic A11 chip is amazing. I don‚Äôt play mobile games but everything I opened and closed felt like butter. It can handle all the apps I open and more without a stutter, so performance isn‚Äôt anything to sneeze at. Mobile gamers might have a different experience but the specs are rocking.The other requirements of the phone are for heavier phone users, but it ought to be fine. I use the iPhone XR now and FaceID feels better and smoother, more intuitive, but the TouchID is still excellent as used on my iPad."

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	Kyriakos Zaritis	4	In-depth review of iPhone 8	2017-11-08	"Another year has passed and a new iPhone (well this time three to be precise) has been released. This review will look at the iPhone 8 in-depth and rate it in a few main categories, such as display, camera, etc. At the end, there will be a summary that will include the advantages and disadvantages spotted and my personal opinion on whether you should upgrade depending on your current iPhone model (if you wish to just see a brief overview, please skip to the end).DESIGN 8/10Ever since the iPhone 6 was released, the design of the iPhone has more or less stayed the same. This isn‚Äôt necessary a bad thing as when you first pick up the new iPhone, you will be shocked by how familiar it looks, but it is slightly frustrating that they could not be a little more inventive and switch up the design of the phone. The main change is that the front and back are glass (reminiscence of the iPhone 4/4s) and an aluminium frame ‚Äústitches‚Äù the two pieces of glass together. It‚Äôs cool and beautiful, but we‚Äôve been seeing something similar for 4 years now. As a consequence of using glass for the front and back of this phone, you will notice that it is slightly heavier (at almost 150g) which makes it not only less slippery but gives it a more premium feel to the device and is also less likely to attract fingerprints (due to its oleophobic coating). This year‚Äôs iPhone has rolled out in only three colours for the standard and plus models: space grey, silver and gold.DISPLAY 8/10It‚Äôs exactly the same with the display of this phone, as it has been ‚Äúrecycled‚Äù for what feels like forever. The 4.7 inch Retina LCD display has a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch which is good, but the same as older models. However, this model has a wider colour and brighter display, but this isn‚Äôt new as it was also in last year‚Äôs iPhone 7. The only difference between the display of the iPhone 8 and ANY older model is the True Tone display which adjusts the display in terms of white balance, brightness and colour temperature, depending on your environment. Pretty cool.OS AND SPECS 10/10The iPhone 8 comes out of the box with the latest iOS 11 and despite being quite buggy when it rolled out, it now runs fantastically smooth. This device is future-proof as it will receive all OS updates for the next 3-4 years. Apart from that, another reason why this smartphone is future-proof is its specs. It has a hexa-core Apple A11 processor which is Apple‚Äôs latest and currently the market‚Äôs greatest (Benchmark scores can confirm this). It also has 2GB of RAM which is enough for an iPhone to run smoothly and two internal storage options of either 64GB/256GB. My personal opinion is to go with 64GB and save a bit of money as it is more than enough memory for the average user/consumer.CAMERA 10/10Despite being identical on paper to last year‚Äôs, the new iPhone outperforms its predecessor in the camera department. It‚Äôs a single lens 12MP camera with an aperture of f/1.8, autofocus and a quad-LED flash. It‚Äôs as excellent as it is every year with improved quality and detail, especially in low-light conditions. Colours are more vibrant and objects/people look more accurate than ever. The iPhone 8 can shoot 4K video which is awesome and surprisingly stable (it does have OIS) and professional for a phone. The front camera has 7MP with an an aperture of f/2.2 and a Retina Flash and selfies look clear and smooth.BATTERY 9/10The iPhone 8 has a smaller battery than the 7, yet still manages to slightly last longer due to it‚Äôs excellent optimisation. The new iPhone has a non-removable 1,821mAh battery which lasts a full day of heavy usage. However, competition has been pushing the boundaries in terms of power and the new Samsung Galaxy smartphones can last two entire days of moderate/heavy usage! Still, let‚Äôs be thankful that Apple is slowly making progress in this department and have even implemented wireless charging. Wireless charging is a cool feature but, due to being unbearably slow and charging only 15% in 30 minutes, I prefer conventional cable charging. This phone does have quick charge but you do have to buy a different cable and plug from the Apple Store which is honestly pretty disappointing! Especially considering EVERY brand that offers quick charge, offers it without if‚Äôs or but‚Äôs (having to buy additional cables).EXTRAS 8/10Not much to say about additional features as almost everything is similar to last year‚Äôs. It‚Äôs IP67 water-resistant at 1m for 30 minutes. It does include NFC but, as always, can only be used for Apple Pay. However, it does include Bluetooth 5.0 (although there aren‚Äôt many Bluetooth 5.0 accessories just yet) and stereo speakers, which are the loudest on an iPhone.OVERALL 8/10Like every year, this is an impressive new iPhone with additional features. It‚Äôs familiar and lightning fast with an incredible camera that outshines its predecessors. This phone, despite its bezels, does feel futuristic as it is Apple‚Äôs first attempt at a fully wireless smartphone. In theory, this phone has completely eliminated the need to use any ports for charging or listening to audio and although Android has done it first, Apple is forcing us to make use of the wireless technology out there‚Ä¶ And I guess, we don‚Äôt really have any other choice.PROS‚Ä®+Beautiful, all-glass design+True Tone display+Lightning fast processor+Incredible camera, even in low-light+Good battery life+Instant unlocking through fingerprint sensor‚Ä®CONS-Similar design to previous three models-Need to buy additional accessories for quick/wireless charging-NFC only available for Apple Pay-Still only IP67Coming from an iPhone 7? Major additions: wireless charging, double storage options, True Tone display, glass design, slightly better battery. In my opinion, you should not update unless you always buy the latest and greatest, or you are a photographer/blogger (in which case, buy the plus version). This is because there are not enough major changes from the model you already own and I personally think it‚Äôs a waste of money but go ahead if you want to.Coming from an iPhone 6s or older? Yes, definitely update. There are more than just a few additional features, you will not regret this."

After a couple months I noticed there was a tiny dot moving around on my camera lense and I ended up having the camera replaced at the Apple store. This was covered by the warranty so I wasn‚Äôt charged at all. The seller was in contact with me during the whole process and checking that everything was alright. I have had no other problems with this phone.

Fantastic phone with lots of extra features. Also very impressed by the battery life and speed of charging. Battery lasts much longer than my old phone that I was needing to charge st least every other day. This lasts me around 3-4 days depending on how much I use it and will fully charge from around 15% to 100% in around 2 1/2 hours.  Also much cheaper, by hundreds of pounds, to buy outright than have it on a contract, especially as I always forget to cancel at the right time and end up over paying for 6 months or so.  If you can't afford it outright, see if you can get an interest free credit card and pay it off in the free months, that's if you're disciplined enough not to spend on it, lol."

The only downside appears to be the speed at which the battery loses its power.  Also if purchasing the excellent Caseology iphone case, be sure not to accidentally push down the mute button on the side.  Basically, this is no longer a phone, it is a miniature computer/ipad.  The 'Touch ID' facility is amazing and allows me to access my Nat West account within seconds and move money around.  It is without doubt an amazing piece of kit.  Buy the Caseology case for it to show it off at its best."

At the beginning it was said they didn‚Äôt have stock, but the day after it changed and was delivered. Then my package arrived on time and everything was okay. I asked for the invoice and got it very fast as well. It‚Äôs an original new iPhone, working well, and at a very good price. I recommend!"

iPhone 8	64GB	Space Grey	Mystified Mister	3	"It's a quality product, but I wouldn't recommend it."	2017-11-28	"Here's a few of my feelings after using this phone for a week.- The 'fake' home button works well, but it doesn't feel as nice to use as an actual home button, and it made me realise for the first time how much better an iPhone without a home button would be (If only the iPhone X was a simdge less expensive...).- The camera takes really detailed and good-looking pictures, and can eeeasily replace a point and shoot camera. The dynamic range is a bit iffy at times, but other than that it's great. I couldn't care less about the lack of 2x optical zoom, especially when it doesn't have image stabilization like on the iPhone 8 plus.- Sadly the battery life isn't anything to boast about, but even worse is how bloody long it takes to charge this thing. Apple, being Apple, doesn't give you their latest fast charging tech in the box, so you're stuck in the slow lane until you inevitably splash out for the newer charger. What annoys me the most is how painfully long it takes to get from 95% to 100%!- 4.7 inches eh? Perfect size you say? Well, no. Franky it's too small of a screen to be really immersed in any sort of media you're watching or playing, but at the same time, it's just too big to use comfortably one handed (unlike the iPhone SE). I will say that unlike it's bigger brother, the 4.7-inch iPhone is far more comfortable in the pocket. But both the iPhone SE and iPhone X will also be comfortable in your pocket, yet these phones offer the advantages of one-handed use and a far more immersive display respectively.- I got the space grey model. Under the right light, and when there's no fingerprint marks on the phone, the iPhone 7S, I mean 8, looks stunning. Absolutely beautiful. But these conditions are rare, and more often than not the glass back looks more messy than classy. To anyone deciding between the two non-female-exclusive colours,  space grey and silver, I actually recommend you go for silver. Reason being, fingerprints on it won't be nearly as noticeable, and the milky colour on the back of the phone is far more interesting and unique. Plus you get a silver ring around the home button which is pretty neat, and actually quite useful when you need to locate the home button in low light situations.- iOS 11 looks fantastic, especially the new control center. However it's so full of bugs on the iPhone 8. For example after being in a landscape app for a while and returning to the home screen (holding the phone in portrait), the notification/control center tabs remain accessible by swiping from the sides of the phone instead of the top and bottom. Not very polished at all."

iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Space Grey	Cameron F.	5	Does exactly what is needed	2019-01-01	"I purchased my iPhone 8 plus on release day 2017 upgrading from a normal iPhone 7. Visually there is little difference between the iPhone 7 generation + the iPhone 8 generation however don't let this put you off. The display visual does seem a little bit better then previous generation and so does the camera. The battery life is by far a lot better then my iPhone 7 ever was, coming on a year and 3 months old my phone still lasts a day and a half with normal use .e.g. texts, phone calls, using as torch and photos however using my phone looking at social media or videos and music this is lowered to about a days worth of charge, however this still beats all previous generation battery life especial at the age it is now when that usually starts to drop. I personally have made the decision not to upgrade from this for the foreseeable future as it does exactly what I require of it and the camera is very good and the storage capacity is excellent. My conclusion on this phone is mixed however the reason for this is if you have a iPhone 6 or older then I would recommend the upgrade to the 8, however if you have the iPhone 7 I recommend skipping this generation as there is not enough change to justify upgrading to this. Now I get to the point why should or would people buy the iPhone 8 when they can get the 2018 models well the truth is a phone is a phone for its age this is very advance and this also comes with a lot smaller price tag so if you are not someone who needs to have all the latest gadgets I would recommend buying this generation for the time being."

iPhone 8 Plus	256GB	Space Grey	kai stenning	4	a very good phone	2018-05-15	"Another year has passed and a new iPhone (well this time three to be precise) has been released. This review will look at the iPhone 8 in-depth and rate it in a few main categories, such as display, camera, etc. At the end, there will be a summary that will include the advantages and disadvantages spotted and my personal opinion on whether you should upgrade depending on your current iPhone model (if you wish to just see a brief overview, please skip to the end).DESIGN 8/10Ever since the iPhone 6 was released, the design of the iPhone has more or less stayed the same. This isn‚Äôt necessary a bad thing as when you first pick up the new iPhone, you will be shocked by how familiar it looks, but it is slightly frustrating that they could not be a little more inventive and switch up the design of the phone. The main change is that the front and back are glass (reminiscence of the iPhone 4/4s) and an aluminium frame ‚Äústitches‚Äù the two pieces of glass together. It‚Äôs cool and beautiful, but we‚Äôve been seeing something similar for 4 years now. As a consequence of using glass for the front and back of this phone, you will notice that it is slightly heavier (at almost 150g) which makes it not only less slippery but gives it a more premium feel to the device and is also less likely to attract fingerprints (due to its oleophobic coating). This year‚Äôs iPhone has rolled out in only three colours for the standard and plus models: space grey, silver and gold.DISPLAY 8/10It‚Äôs exactly the same with the display of this phone, as it has been ‚Äúrecycled‚Äù for what feels like forever. The 4.7 inch Retina LCD display has a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch which is good, but the same as older models. However, this model has a wider colour and brighter display, but this isn‚Äôt new as it was also in last year‚Äôs iPhone 7. The only difference between the display of the iPhone 8 and ANY older model is the True Tone display which adjusts the display in terms of white balance, brightness and colour temperature, depending on your environment. Pretty cool.OS AND SPECS 10/10The iPhone 8 comes out of the box with the latest iOS 11 and despite being quite buggy when it rolled out, it now runs fantastically smooth. This device is future-proof as it will receive all OS updates for the next 3-4 years. Apart from that, another reason why this smartphone is future-proof is its specs. It has a hexa-core Apple A11 processor which is Apple‚Äôs latest and currently the market‚Äôs greatest (Benchmark scores can confirm this). It also has 2GB of RAM which is enough for an iPhone to run smoothly and two internal storage options of either 64GB/256GB. My personal opinion is to go with 64GB and save a bit of money as it is more than enough memory for the average user/consumer.CAMERA 10/10Despite being identical on paper to last year‚Äôs, the new iPhone outperforms its predecessor in the camera department. It‚Äôs a single lens 12MP camera with an aperture of f/1.8, autofocus and a quad-LED flash. It‚Äôs as excellent as it is every year with improved quality and detail, especially in low-light conditions. Colours are more vibrant and objects/people look more accurate than ever. The iPhone 8 can shoot 4K video which is awesome and surprisingly stable (it does have OIS) and professional for a phone. The front camera has 7MP with an an aperture of f/2.2 and a Retina Flash and selfies look clear and smooth.BATTERY 9/10The iPhone 8 has a smaller battery than the 7, yet still manages to slightly last longer due to it‚Äôs excellent optimisation. The new iPhone has a non-removable 1,821mAh battery which lasts a full day of heavy usage. However, competition has been pushing the boundaries in terms of power and the new Samsung Galaxy smartphones can last two entire days of moderate/heavy usage! Still, let‚Äôs be thankful that Apple is slowly making progress in this department and have even implemented wireless charging. Wireless charging is a cool feature but, due to being unbearably slow and charging only 15% in 30 minutes, I prefer conventional cable charging. This phone does have quick charge but you do have to buy a different cable and plug from the Apple Store which is honestly pretty disappointing! Especially considering EVERY brand that offers quick charge, offers it without if‚Äôs or but‚Äôs (having to buy additional cables).EXTRAS 8/10Not much to say about additional features as almost everything is similar to last year‚Äôs. It‚Äôs IP67 water-resistant at 1m for 30 minutes. It does include NFC but, as always, can only be used for Apple Pay. However, it does include Bluetooth 5.0 (although there aren‚Äôt many Bluetooth 5.0 accessories just yet) and stereo speakers, which are the loudest on an iPhone.OVERALL 8/10Like every year, this is an impressive new iPhone with additional features. It‚Äôs familiar and lightning fast with an incredible camera that outshines its predecessors. This phone, despite its bezels, does feel futuristic as it is Apple‚Äôs first attempt at a fully wireless smartphone. In theory, this phone has completely eliminated the need to use any ports for charging or listening to audio and although Android has done it first, Apple is forcing us to make use of the wireless technology out there‚Ä¶ And I guess, we don‚Äôt really have any other choice.PROS +Beautiful, all-glass design+True Tone display+Lightning fast processor+Incredible camera, even in low-light+Good battery life+Instant unlocking through fingerprint sensorCONS-Similar design to previous three models-Need to buy additional accessories for quick/wireless charging-NFC only available for Apple Pay-Still only IP67"

iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Silver	Andreas Patsalos	5	An honest review.	2018-09-02	"The most powerful phone I‚Äôve ever had. I was looking to ipgrade from my 7 non-Plus because I couldn‚Äôt bare woth the relatively small display (4.7 inch) any more and after a long research, this will be my phone for the next at least 5 years.I was comparing to the X and to what‚Äôs going to be released this September as well and it won for me by a long shot.It has a 16:9 display, the natural resolution of YouTube. The X and the new ones are 19:9 and videos in YouTube are a little zoomed which is annoying. Also, it has the most beautiful LCD I‚Äôve seen on a phone. The OLED on the new ones is a no for me because of the chance it has to get burn marks. Also, its wider display is awesome for my big hands. Its screen is 5,5 inch while the X is 5,8 but you see way more conent on the 8 Plus.Second, the Touch ID. Much faster and accurate than Face ID at the moment. Face ID is the future but in my opinion it‚Äôs currently in a beta state.Third, moving away from the differences between this and the new ones, is its battery. I get absolutely INCREDIBLE battery. It‚Äôs no way compared to my 7. I tinkered my settings after watching various YouTube videos and I LOVE my battery time. Easily 3 days with moderate use.Fourth, the camera. Oh god what a camera. Again, nothing like my 7‚Äôs. Crisp clear and the portrait mode is AWESOME. With some tips I‚Äôve seen on the internet about taking photos, my photos look like professional ones now.Lastly, compared to androids, the fact that I get updates, both OS ones and security ones, instantly is a huge plus. With android phones, if you don‚Äôt own a Google Pixel phone, you must wait in line to get any updates, and the wait time is longer depending on the manufacturer. Also, owning a variety of Apple and Android phones, I‚Äôve found out that my Apple phones last WAY longer than android ones. My 5S for example is still blazing fast. Apple does care about their old phones. You can see that woth iOS 12 coming out and boosting the performance of the old phones by a HUGE."
iPhone 8 Plus	64GB	Space Grey	DavidAlan1988	5	I was a long term android user.	2018-07-14	"I‚Äôve been using android and pretty much nothing else but since 2010. So I‚Äôd just like to say that if your thinking of making the switch, do it.The iPhone 8 Plus is an expensive way to start, but the one thing I didn‚Äôt want to do was downsize my screen. Coming from a huawei p10 Plus I was used to a very quick phone. The 8 Plus is just as quick through general navigation and use I‚Äôd say, but blows gaming away with not only the A11 chip but just how well games are optimised on iOS. The device oozes quality but I will say you definitely want to look after it. A good case is a must as well as a decent screen protector (plenty of both on Amazon).What‚Äôs it like as a phone? Calls are great. Very clear calls every time. Texting? This was an annoyance for me on android because even third party keyboards for me are not as good as the stock iOS keyboard. I can confidently type with my eyes closed now and mistakes are very few and far between.The camera(s)? The dual 12mp setup on the Plus is more than capable of taking brilliant snaps worthy of printing and sharing. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs down to the true tone display or the camera but pics do appear a little on the warm side. Nowhere near as harsh as the likes of a galaxy s9 though.Making the switch... Android is a great mobile OS for a lot of reasons. However here‚Äôs my reasons for now preferring iOS:>The layout. I love the clean straightforward look of iOS. Sure android is more versatile in this field, but I always found I could never settle on the same look for very long. I just don‚Äôt notice this anymore.>No repeated or needless apps, I got so used to being forced to have multiple keyboards media players message apps and gallery‚Äôs it became senseless having stock android and then the manufacturer apps together. No need for launchers or anything 3rd party anymore. I think the system apps are just that good.>Freedom to uninstall. On my device almost every app bar the core apps can be uninstalled at the tap of a finger. Another major of annoyance of android, it‚Äôs great having multifunction devices but not when your bogged down with so many you don‚Äôt even use.>Amazing battery life from iOS now. It‚Äôs a fact that iOS used to suffer from poor battery but I just cannot wear this phone out. Even games don‚Äôt drain the battery by very much, I am very impressed."

I opted for 256GB to somewhat future proof, very happy, thank you."
iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Alana	1	Absolute joke! Completely out of pocket	2018-10-02	I have had the phone for 4 weeks and already the speaker has broke.

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Big Fred	5	Good supplier for iPhones	2018-07-16	The iPhone 7 is a very good phone as verified by outfits like Which. This supplier delivered in a very short time at a competitive price and it arrived in good order
iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Greypilgrim	5	Worth your pay	2018-09-05	I am very happy that I bought this phone even though I was quite hesitant before about the low price and chances of it being a refurbished one or one with few damages. But a brand new iPhone7 for this price was obviously a better bet than buying in any other retail outlets or the apple store itself!

The 7 is the lightest, smallest and well-supported (wrt iOS updates) that I could find. It does the job.The phone was delivered in one day during the busy Christmas period. I was desperate for it as I was travelling at this time. Almost 2 months now, and it works perfectly, no problems at all. As with small iPhones (and smartphones) the battery doesn't last long if you're running heavy workloads like Fortnite, etc."

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Katie	2	Badly damaged screen	2019-03-26	"Bought a used/renewed iPhone 7 in December. I knew the phone wasn't going to be perfect, especially for the price - but there is a small crack on the left hand side near the bottom. It's also severely scratched. My iPhone 6 I've had for 4 years is in far better condition, so the phone has clearly not been looked after. Battery capacity was at 87% when I got it, its now 85% but I haven't had any issues yet. I probably should have returned the phone when I got it, and somewhat regret it now.  But I suppose it does the job, and the touch screen and everything work with no issues."

iPhone 7	256GB	Silver	K. Taylor	5	Niece is delighted with this üëçüòÅ	2018-01-18	"Bought this for my niece and she's delighted with it. It more than meets her expectations and the 256 GB WILL be needed for all the creative things she's able to use the phone for that she never realised she could do with it. She's at college doing an Animation Course so is able to do some of her work on the phone. Her iPad packed in and this phone ""almost"" replaces that for many things, so it's not just being used as a phone and it's NOT for random Selfies!!!Unlikely that most folk would need 256 GB, but smaller memories available cheaper. I could not find the 256 GB version elsewhere, but this seemed a very good price compared to elsewhere for iPhone 7s with less memory.Whether this is the right phone for you, depends on your needs, so do your homework first to get the right model or it could be an expensive mistake.I'm glad I chose this iPhone 7 with the huge 256 GB memory for her and was happy with the price. It arrived promptly, no problems and I was happy with the seller. If this is for you, I would recommend üëç"

Ordered on a Wednesday evening, received acknowledgment of the order nearly immediately. Then received a despatch notice on Thursday to say the phone would be with me on Friday morning with the specific time frame window given. Delivery came as specified and if I could give three thumbs up, I would. Keep up the good work."

iPhone 7	128GB	Jet Black	Oscar	3	I Still Miss The Headphone Jack	2018-03-17	This phone is meh. I know that‚Äôs not really a word but it‚Äôs what comes to mind when I think of the iPhone 7. It‚Äôs meh. It‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not the worst phone but it‚Äôs certainly not the best.  The build of the phone is good. It feels good in the hand and it‚Äôs comfy to hold. The phone is a nice decent size although the display wouldn‚Äôt hurt to be a bit bigger to shrink the obnoxious beazels. There is one major flaw with this phone though and that is the fact it misses the headphone jack. For some people that might not matter. But for me it matters intensely as a lot of my time spent on my phone is spent listening to music and yes you can listen to music on this phone with Apples supplied headphones but the moment you wanna charge your phone and listen to music you can‚Äôt or if you‚Äôre watching something on your phone you can charge at the same time. And to me that‚Äôs a big deal breaker. Aside from that the build of this phone is magnificent.  The softwear on this phone confuses me. It‚Äôs simple to use but it confuses me in the sense that it develops bugs and then fixes them by itself. The phone is almost self healing in that sense but the problem is it‚Äôs causing the problems in the first place. And every time apple release a new update there seems to be a massive bug realesed along side.  The camera on this phone is amazing though. It‚Äôs simple to use and takes amazing photos. The problem is it‚Äôs kind of too simple to use; it lacks a pro mode unlike other phones like Samsung‚Äôs. The speakers on this phone are not half bad. But theyre not HTC speakers. But they get the job done and do it reasonably well. Overall this phone is good. But it‚Äôs not amazing. If you can afford to I‚Äôd recommend splashing out and getting the iPhone 8 as it seems a lot better than this one. Or not I would definitely recommend a Samsung or the iPhone 6 as they both still have a headphone jack.

iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	jamiepryor	4	"the camera on this thing is brilliant, better than other Samsung models that I have ..."	2018-01-23	"I‚Äôve had my iphone 7 since early September and here is my review:Positives:- First of all, what sets it apart from other iphones previous to this model is that it is waterproof, meaning that you will no longer be placing your hone in rice when it gets wet, it also means that you get stunning underwater photos- Speaking of stunning photos, the camera on this thing is brilliant, better than other Samsung models that I have used that came out at the same time. This is also great as I no longer have to carry my camera around when I go out on walks and such.- The phones processor is very good and it runs apps smoothly and quickly without much fault, and many of the faults that do occur, are updated in apples software updates- I have the 128gb version of this phone which is a lot more data than I need, meaning that I wont ever run out.Negatives:- One major negative I think that most people have with this phone is that they removed the headphone jack, which means that all headphone plug ins go through the charging port, this means that you can no longer listen to music and charge your phone unless you have a dongle.- Another issue I have with this phone is that it is easily cracked, I recommend that if you buy this product, you also buy a case with it, so you wont end up having to get a new one."

iPhone 7	128GB	Black	tactless (no tact)	4	"Amazing, mind-blowing"	2017-07-20	"So, I had the red version of this, but I found the white bezels very distracting so I returned it for a refund.Now I've for the black one, I'm amazed every time I use it. The colours are AMAZING. It just like, woah!BUT.. but but ‚Ä¶ here's the big but.It's slippery and fragile.I use a case (AmazonBasics case), which makes it easier to hold. The downside is that it looks like every other touchscreen smartphone with the case on ‚Äî but this is also a benefit. I do NOT want to advertise the fact that I'm carrying a high end phone so that some miscreant can throw acid on my face and mug me. [theives can sell it for parts even if it's iCloud locked]. So, I'm happy. [I'm not a show off ‚Äî I don't care if people think I'm cheap.]All that said, I'm still angry at Apple :- they removed the headphone jack too early. (I'm not rich so no AirPods for me)- they're utterly obssessed with thin-ness. (While it is very, very impressive I shouldn't be scared to break a ¬£680 phone).I use this phone ‚Äî the iPhone 7 ‚Äî for videography. The optical image stabilisation is fantastic.My main phone will continue to be my iPhone SE.Just a note: as impressive at the iPhone 7 hardware is, it's really the rock solid software (iOS) and app ecosystem that makes the iPhone so compelling to me. I see competitors ‚Äî like the Samsung S8 or whatever (‚Äùunbox your phone"") ‚Äî and admit they are jaw-dropping science fiction. But, even so, they don't have the security and stability of iOS.If you can borrow the money, I recommend you buy this from the Apple Store and get a refund on the last day possible. [dont feel bad for Apple ‚Äî they are loaded]. It will help you appreciate what outstanding engineering this is.It's kind of a misnomer to call this a phone, of course ‚Äî it is a handheld computer.Be warned : this phone is like crack cocaine. Once you've used this, and you get rid of it, you'll miss it ! It's flawed in many ways, but it's also the very best."

However after opening I noticed a sheet in the package stating that the phone will work with any network but once a SIM card is inserted the phone is then forever locked to that network, going on to say that if you are not happy with that then send back for full refund. That information should be in the description before purchase not a surprise on opening. And in any case I had already opened the phone. That is not what is generally understood by 'SIM free' and the answers to the questions that have been asked do not mention this locking so definitely deliberately holding back information. Nul points from me."

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Keston fitzpatrick	4	Rough summary of the iPhone 7	2017-06-05	"The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are deeply unusual devices. They are full of aggressive breaks from convention while wrapped in cases that look almost exactly like their two direct predecessors. Even that continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a decade of Apple‚Äôs steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same design for a third straight year plays against expectations.Inside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to two hours."
iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	AMX	1	IOS	2018-02-09	"I am beginning to find that the IOS controls and configurations are getting increasingly and unnecessarily convoluted and complicated, and therefore counter intuitive and counter productive. The phone is also very expensive. All in all, rather dissapointed and will be switching to Android soon."

iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Amazon Customer	5	a bit disappointed that it is more pink in colour	2017-04-05	"Having had the iPhone 5 and 6 both in muted colours I decided to be more girly with the rose gold, a bit disappointed that it is more pink in colour. Sound is much better with the dual speakers at the bottom and the camera seems much better than the 6 although I am no expert photos appear to have more clarity and battery life is really good."

iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	sharron urnevitch	5	Amazing phone definitely worth buying	2016-11-09	"Instead of the iPhone 6S, with just a 3D Touch screen in the way of new features and a few power boosts here and there, we'd have had a waterproof handset with dual speakers, a brighter and more colorful screen and a boosted 12MP camera that took better pictures than the one on the iPhone 6.Changing the home button from a clickable entity to something that responds to pressure ‚Äì and possibly even the loss of the headphone jack ‚Äì would have been seen as innovative and alternative in a sea of identikit handsets.And if Apple had thrown in the new Jet Black finish with a top-end 256GB storage model‚Ä¶ well, that would have been a real challenger, a chance for the brand to cast off the 'tick-tock' mentality of keeping the smaller upgrades confined to the S variants, and remind us that it just makes great phones."

iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Perfect Reviews	5	The best feature me personally is the waterproofing	2016-10-16	"I am really impressed with the iPhone 7. The new phone is really zippy and fast at what it does. The best feature me personally is the waterproofing. I think this is a great move by Apple, its a real shame there is no wireless as most phones today have this feature.Now i owned a iPhone 4, 5s, and 6, so this was an obvious upgrade. I know many people say its a 6s but yes your right it looks like a 6s, and that's where it ends. Hardware is upgraded and camera and IOS10 is brilliant there is a few features that i like more on IOS9. But hey ho. It works wonderfully.As for the whole no headphone jack i am really not bothered and has made no difference to me. You get a little connector so you use that. I tend to use bluetooth with my speaker. So again has not been an issue.I have noticed a difference in battery life. not ground breaking. but its about tweaking the settings and you can get a good 2 days life of heavy use i do. The box it comes in is a nice and posh box.The headphones though the little connector are the same as the other ones. So the connector makes no difference. So overall if your a die hard Apple fan then its a must.I look forward to the Anniversary Edition next will look. But this is certainly a good phone. And well recommended. I cant really find much negatives. I suppose the battery life could of been better. As they made so much its going to have a bigger battery because there is no headphone.So lastly if your iPhone 5s or 6 owner its an obvious upgrade. But if you have 6s owner then maybe not really benefiting only the waterproofing.Comment |"

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Jonathan Shore	2	Not as good as the 6	2016-12-28	"I'm sufficiently sad to have had every iPhone model that's come out - and am no fan of Android phones at all. But...the iPhone 7 simply isn't worth it. I have an iPhone 6 for work so can do head-to-head comparisons. Now maybe it's because the uk iPhone 7 has the apparently rubbish intel chip, but the 6 outperforms the 7 significantly in two key respects - mobile signal reception and wifi reception. I park the two phones next to each other and while the 7 struggles to get signal, the 6 is happily connected.Whatever else a smartphone is meant to do, making phone calls and going online is where it all starts from and in this respect the 7 is a  wry expensive fail. The camera however is superb, can't begin to say how much better the pictures are - a real step forward in quality.But for the basics, the 7 doesn't live up to its price tag and I find myself having to use the 6 on frequent occasions (travel a lot for work) because the 7 is floundering. Can't deny that although I will probably be in the queue when the 8 comes out I feel really let down by the 7.Yes, it's waterproof too but given my absentminded habit of giving my phones regular rides in the washing machine, I'm not sure it's that waterproof. The 7 is a bit like visiting an Apple Store at the weekend - it looks fantastic but is ultimately totally frustrating because you can't get any service."
iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Scampo	5	If you're new to iPhone - this will be a revelation.	2016-10-07	"I got fed up with my Lumia 650 losing Wi-Fi, being generally sluggish and (okay, I know it sounds a bit weak...) the Facebook never working properly. I gave Microsoft many months to sort Windows 10 mobile out but they haven't, and I somehow suspect they can't, despite being the world's largest software company.So I bit the bullet. I bought an iPhone 7 (32gb) - not from Amazon, unusually for me, because so far their pricing isn't good. I'm sure it will be - so Carphone Warehouse got my money.The phone is a revelation to me. Everything works so well, I'd forgotten what ""works"" means regarding mobile phones. Apps open instantly, the internet never fails and pages load almost magically quickly. The phone and the whole experience feels a million dollars (as it should at the price!), and - despite what the other reviewer says - 32gb seems plenty to me for my general kind of usage. If you were downloading movies and songs, taking lots of videos then I expect the 128gb version would be a sensible buy. I doubt I'll ever regret saving myself another ¬£100.00 on top of an already obscene amount for what - a phone! Okay - it's vastly more than a phone!! It's easy to move photos to your PC now and again if space becomes limited, and MP3s really don't take up that much space. I think the 32gb version would suit many users - if you have the money!It's a stunning piece of kit. Well done Apple. To criticise the screen resolution by comparing it to a Samsung might technically be fair, but practically, this screen looks amazing. The colours are brilliant and the sharpness is as much as the eye can make out so far as I can see. Also, my last android phone left me in despair with so many updates and fiddling around. I came to the conclusion that android was a phone system designed by computer geeks and not made for people who  want simplicity. The iPhone is made for easy usage and does all  that could be imagined in a mobile phone."

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Amazon Customer	3	It's OK.	2016-10-31	"Its an OK phone but its very restricted and there was no reason to remove the headphone jack but for apple to get more money out of their customers. Returned the phone after 14 days and went with the Xperia XZ instead and have found it to be much less restricted, a much more natural looking camera and more premium phone overall. Also has a headphone jack with 5 pin noise cancelling and hi res audio, which is a bonus too!"
iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Amazon Customer	1	iPhone = iDiot	2017-07-10	My first (and last) iphone: a lot of money for the most overrated phone! Average hardware specs with very limiting (& spying) software. Buying this iPhone makes you really feel like an iDiot. If you are looking for quality without the (many) apple software limitations and extortionate price then do yourself a favor and buy an Android.

iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	AmazonAddict	1	Think twice about so called Certified Refurbished	2018-08-16	"First phone lasted only a couple of months before starting to go faulty. First screen kept flashing, then the earpiece went faulty. Took almost a week to get replacement from the seller.Second handset came, some sort of sim tray fault. Absolute waste of time, went and got one from the high steet at full price instead.There was zero apple warranty with telephonesonline. Its their own in house repair so I would certainly think twice before purchasing especially if you value your time."
iPhone 7	32GB	Gold	N	1	Not as advertised	2019-02-17	This item had to be returned to the seller as it was as not advertised - it was described as unlocked to any network but the phone was locked to EE who were unable to assist in unlocking it as I was not the person who orignally took the contract and I was unable to use it - given the runaround - very frustrating

iPhone 7	128GB	Jet Black	Andrew L.	5	"Fantastic phone, great looks and impressive camera!"	2017-04-08	"Love the phone! I purchased with Amazon as the supplier for slightly more security, worth spending the few extra pounds.Have used multiple SIM cards in it already with no issues.Jet Black is beautiful, but will scratch and smudges very easily, so you'll need a case. The camera is great and really produces some top end pics. Delighted with battery life, giving me full day of usage with around 20-30% left at night most days.Worth spending the extra bit for 128gb, some of the newer apps etc take up plenty space and you don't want to have the issue 1 year down the line of needing to clear memory."

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Anglian Traveller	5	The philosophy of continuous improvement	2017-07-20	"As a several years‚Äô iPhone user, a washing machine-related mishap with my 5s led me to upgrade to the new 4G iPhone 7.The regular 7 is the ideal size to fit your pocket and very lightweight, but a larger version of the phone is available for avid gamers who like a bigger screen and which has more camera functions too, with a ¬£100 price premium.The main takeaways:1. The iPhone design as ever is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use. The 7‚Äôs case-colours are subtle and classy-looking with black, grey and metallic pastels endowing the phone with a quality image2. The screen is a big leap forward from the 6, with clear bright graphics and allowing you to choose icon and text size (perfect for those of us whose vision isn‚Äôt quite as sharp as it used to be). The regular 7 seems to have finally got the balance right between a good usable screen size and convenient portability3. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, using the phone in landscape format has the effect of widening the keypad4. The ring tone & speaker volume is clearer & louder on the iPhone 7 than any of its rivals5. The new cordless airpods sense when they‚Äôre in your ears and pause when you remove them, so finally an end to earphones with trailing cables6. The iPhone 7 is splashproof and may be immersed in water for a time without damage; Apple though does not guarantee the phone will remain undamaged if it is accidentally left in a pocket and subsequently endures a complete wash/spin cycle7. There‚Äôs no doubt about it, the new dual camera system on the 7 is fantastic8. There are three options for memory capacity (naturally with rising price tags as you go up): 32G, 128G and 256G. I would suggest that unless you‚Äôre continuously streaming hi-def videos and downloading big games, 32G is going to be enough for most users with a storage capacity such that you‚Äôre unlikely to ever need more9. Everything you do on the phone including your contacts may be backed up on the i-cloud, so should your phone be lost and not recovered, a new one may be easily reconfigured with your preferred settings and contact databaseGripes: very few -1. The battery life isn‚Äôt great but is an improvement on the 5 and 6, and moreover you can now buy a phone case incorporating 24-hours of extra battery life, though it makes the phone more bulky2. The price of the 7 is high for a buyer on a modest income, but as usual you get what you pay for and this is a premium productIt‚Äôs easy to see why Apple maintains market leadership with such excellent products and back-up service through their funky high street/mall Apple stores full of knowledgeable, intelligent and helpful staff. Make sure you buy a screen protector and a silicone rubber-back case to protect the sides of the phone in case it gets accidentally dropped on the street ‚Äì which it eventually will.Finally, some one-star reviews posted on amazon are from buyers griping about having been shipped locked or otherwise non-functional phones by online sellers. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints about the seller. One solution is to buy from an Apple store; they‚Äôll set up the new iPhone for you, transfer all your contacts, settings and data from your old phone and be available to resolve any subsequent issues."

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	John Duffy	5	Iphone7 review for beginners	2017-06-13	"This review is for the IPhone 7, in general, not this ""unlocked"" model. I bought my first IPhone today, the IPhone 7. I paid over 700 Euro for it, with a no-contract, no-bill Vodafone-locked handset. First impression: excellent quality, the main reason I bought the Iphone 7. I've owned an Apple IPod Nano for years, it still plays great-sounding music, it's build quality is second to none, the rechargeable battery still provides hours of listening. So, I knew already the Apple range of products are exceptionally well-built. Having owned various Android smartphones I was reluctant to buy an IPhone. An IPhone has usually cost that bit more. Plus, the ransom ware targeting Apple IPhones specifically seems a terrible risk. But, being unfamiliar with an IPhone and having used the IPhone 7 for the day I'm happy to say it's every bit as quality a product as I'd hoped, it's easy to set up, feels lightweight and I know precisely where my money spent went. I can't yet comment on the IPhone 7's features but I'm already confident like a Volvo, (I drove a 7-40 model), and Mercedes Benz, BMW car, I know the investment is worth it. I see myself using this handset, like the IPod Nano, for a long time to come. Solid piece of kit."

iPhone 7	256GB	Black	Dale Edward	4	"Do you really need 256GB when 128 is way big enough at over ¬£150,00 less."	2016-10-04	"This phone is not just a phone, but for many it is a status symbol, telling others not only can I afford this new device but that I am technically savvy and keeping up with the Apple bandwagon of new devices in a fast moving technical field.To be honest, there is very little change in the appearance to the new iPhone 7 compared to its predecessor, however, that‚Äôs not the point as it is exactly what the Apple enthusiast would expect in that it is a visual attractive, powerful, reliable and efficient device with some internal upgrades that will help apps to work faster and additional obvious enhancements that will satisfy the customers desire to purchase one.So what is new and why did I get one?Memory size:  The 128GB seems to be the best and most popular option with best value for money, as it is sufficient to carry all your apps, additional memory needs and other normal things that you need to access.  The 256GB is just a ridiculous luxury and waste of money as there are very few users that could fill that size of memory, so save yourself over ¬£150,00 and get the 128GB its just right.Design:  The design has not changed much in that the body and screen sizes are virtually the same as the iPhone 6 and it still has round edges and a nice feel in the hand.  There is still a protruding camera lens on the rear that some users might find irritating as this takes away a flush finish on the rear of the device.External Sound:  This has been greatly improved by the introduction of dual speakers positioned at the top and bottom of the device.  This has improved the sound quality immensely, which now produces decent stereo sound, great for listening to music or watching a movie without an earpiece.Headphone Jack:  This has been removed and replaced with a lightning port, but why is the question; simple answer is that it has released space for internal upgrades by removing the old out of date 3.5mm input.  This could be a big game changer for people who have bought expensive earphones that come with the 3.5mm headphone jack capability only.  However, you get an adaptor with the iPhone 7 that allows the 3.5mm jack to insert into the lightning port and the iPhone 7 does come with a pair of lightning port compatible ear buds.  They are actually really good and this new system is good, as Apple has decided to take a bold step, embracing change for the better and the future in design and innovation of smart phones.Bluetooth:  This has been enhanced with the addition of Apples own Proprietary wireless standard, which is so simple to use, where items such as the Apple AirPods (wireless ear phones) connect automatically when the AirPods are placed next to the iPhone.  These are brilliant as they are based on new tech where they pause music automatically when you remove one from your ear and they automatically switch from iPhone to iPad, or Apple watch.  You can buy the ear AirPods separately for 1,59 pounds and they are brilliant.Water resistant:  I must admit I did have great fun taking pictures of my son diving into a pool on holiday once with a waterproof phone.  The expression on his face as he entered the water was captured from under the water, which added a new dimension to our holiday snaps.  Therefore it is a great feature if you are next to the pool or sea on holiday, or if you just want to watch films in the bath.  On a more serious note, I have had a phone that accidently got wet and was ruined and therefore even if it is only protection for such a valuable and essential item then it is worth having the waterproof capability.Battery life:  Apple claim that the battery life has been increased from its predecessor to an extra 2 hours in normal use.  However, this is something that each user and the type of use with the device will no doubt determine.Camera: The rear camera still protrudes from the body however; you now get a dual lens main camera combining a wide angle lens and telephoto lens with much better low light capability, richer snaps and a faster shutter speed.  The front camera has also been increased to 7MP.Minor changes:  The home button now vibrates under your finger rather than clicking all the way in and the finger print recognition requires more pressure than previous iPhones.  To be honest this is just a slightly different feel for both functions but nothing to jump up and down about.Screen resolution:  The screen resolution and appearance doesn‚Äôt appear to be any different even if there have been internal upgrades to 1080 resolution and to be honest Apple are still way behind Samsung with their OHD resolution.Overall there is not a great deal of change especially to the appearance of the new iPhone 7, but with the internal upgrades and minor enhancements that they have made it is enough to get any Apple enthusiast excited."

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	Amazon Customer	1	This phone is the biggest load of garbage I've had	2017-03-23	"This phone is the biggest load of garbage I've had. All that's this phone does is freeze, turn off and won't come back on after. And when It eventually comes back on after it turning itself off, it takes ages to come back on. I genuinely wouldn't buy this, I'd wait for the iPhone 7s or iPhone 8 to come out. You might get a better quality phone then."

iPhone 7	32GB	Matte Black	filip lenczkiewicz	5	Not every one will agree to buy apple products because of the software but i think it is simple modern and easy to use	2016-11-01	this new phone from apple is so powerful in its small form . Apple took it to the next level and created not a phone but a computer ! Not every one will agree to buy apple products because of the software but i think it is simple modern and easy to use. the down sides are that it has no 3.5 mm jack  for audio however you get an adapter from 3.5 mm jack to lightning which i think is pretty nice from apples side . i love the black finish on the phone and the camera is 12mp on the front so it can shoot 4k videos no problemthank you for reading my review on the iphone 7 :)

iPhone 7	32GB	Rose Gold	Raj Kumar Basu	3	Not Value For Money - Paid half of the price for just only Apple Logo :(	2019-07-11	Nice product but really over priced due to brand name. You can do a lot better than any android phones with half of this phone's price.  I  would say the Phone is not value for money at all ... :(The build of the phone is good. It feels good in the hand and it‚Äôs comfy to hold.The software on this phone confuses me. It‚Äôs simple to use but it confuses me in the sense that it develops bugs and then fixes them by itself. The phone is almost self healing in that sense but the problem is it‚Äôs causing the problems in the first place. And every time apple release a new update there seems to be a massive bug released along side.The camera on this phone is amazing though. It‚Äôs simple to use and takes amazing photos. The problem is it‚Äôs kind of too simple to use; it lacks a pro mode unlike other phones like Samsung‚Äôs. The speakers on this phone are not half bad. But theyre not HTC speakers. But they get the job done and do it reasonably well. Overall this phone is good. But it‚Äôs not amazing.Buy a budget android phone will do all rather more than it can do.

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Gold	Dr. Danger Mousette	5	Good value for money - Decent refurb too	2019-05-28	"I  bought this refurbished iPhone 7plus because the price was good. It arrived very quickly, and was exceptionally well packaged. When I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised by the refurbishment. It literally looked like a new phone.In terms of functionality, everything worked like a new iPhone, with one exception. The home button had some 'play' in it and was sometimes a bit flaky when it came to unlocking the phone using the fingerprint technology.The battery life has been very good - comparable with a new phone in fact. The only time it drains unnecessarily quickly is because of quirks with Apple software, for example, you find that location services are turned on for apps that don't actually need it.Other than that, I would highly recommend this phone."

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Jet Black	brentalexis	5	DONE IT AGAIN	2017-05-14	"Firstly let me give credit to Amazon for their excellent service. I went into a well known store which is on my driving route, thinking that I could just walk away with a newly purchased iPhone 7, but to be told that they did not have one and it would take two days to have one delivered to my home at a time that was inconvenient to me! On the same evening I went on to Amazon made my order and had it delivered to a local collection point the next day by 1pm. Brilliant !What about the iPhone 7? Well I have had a iPhone 4, a couple of iPhone 5's and now a 7. Well for me it is progress and in particular I think that this is just the right screen size, especially as I am of a mature age and sometimes find the text size a bit challenging. Most things are in the right places and there are new features which I will consider setting up as i get more familiar. The finger print reader is a good idea, as I have had this on one of my laptops for many years. It is very easy to set up. The main negative for me is the price is perhaps a bit too high however Amazon was cheaper than the shop I first tried so do shop around. However I hope to use this for a few years and so will get good value that way. So if your ready for an upgrade or a new kid on the block, I recommend it"

iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Cambridge Kisby	5	Skip What 2017 Has To Offer! Take A Blast From The Past!	2017-11-12	"So you‚Äôve managed to set some money aside, right in time for the release of the best new smartphone from Apple. In recent years, iPhone users have been met with only one question when deciding their phone for the next year: Small or Big? But now, Apple has made us change this question entirely. Small, Big or Stupid Expensive? For the price of your 17 year old‚Äôs Peugeot 308, Apple is asking up to ¬£1,400 for their latest innovation into the smartphone world. Is this too much? Yes of course it is. Not only am I here to say you should skip the iPhone X (or 10 depending on your preference), I am here to say skip this year's generation entirely. The iPhone 7 Plus, in my opinion, is the best iPhone you can buy right now; and it won‚Äôt blow the back out your wallet either.Dual 12MP Rear Facing Camera's, 1080p 5.5inch Display, Liquid Like Smoothness and Performance, Touch ID, Waterproofing....there is not a lot of area's in which this phone set's a foot wrong. In my experience, it has been a joy to use this phone and have done for 2 months now.Now,  at this point in my review, I‚Äôm guessing most of your thinking ‚ÄúAnother Apple fanboy‚Ä¶‚Äù. But let me reassure you. This is my first proper go at an iPhone experience. I‚Äôm typing this very review on an Asus Chromebook I bought off Gumtree and don‚Äôt even own a watch, let alone a smart one. In the past I have been frustrated with the slowness of Android phones in general; watching iPhone users get halfway through the first level of Angry Birds before I am even though the loading screen (yes, I still play Angry Birds!). The main reason I turned to Tim Cook is that iPhone‚Äôs just work and the software is optimised to work with the hardware. They may not have the features a Samsung Galaxy S8 has or the camera of a Google Pixel 2, but I can bet money today, my iPhone 7 Plus will still be in my pocket for years to come.I know you haven't go all day so I'm going to finish up now by way of a checklist. Camera - Great. Battery Life - Great. Build Quality - Tank Like. Display - Good but no Samsung S8 good! Waterproofing - Neat. Performance - Smooth as Frank Sinatra.You're not going to be disappointed with this phone at all. It might lack a headphone jack (but at least they still give you an adapter!), and might not have the edge to edge display of the Samsung Galaxy S8 or iPhone X but this phone is not for the person who wants the latest technological advancements anymore. This is for the 9-5 businessman, who needs a small computer in their pocket. This is for the stay at home mum, who wants great photos of their kids before they go off to school or college. This is for the retired father, taking their first leap into modern day technology. Whoever you are, you won't be disappointed with an iPhone 7 Plus in your pocket."

I use a Samsung android phone for work and it sucks, yes, you can modify almost everything on it, but that's because you need to.If you are think about getting the iPhone 7 plus just do it, you won't regret it."

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Silver	Conner	3	"Great Phone for Hardcore Apple Fans, but for an improved phone there are other options"	2017-06-23	"I purchased this phone to test it and compare my experience with my daily driver, which is the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus.The camera is amazing and portrait mode is amazing and my favourite feature of this phone.However, personally I feel like the IPhone 7 Plus lacks compared to the S8 Plus. The battery isn't as good for heavy usage.The software is more restrictive compared to Android on the S8 Plus. This is fine for previous Apple users, but can be difficult for people coming from the Andrioid world.I like the phone, but I prefer my S8 Plus over the IPhone 7 Plus. However, I do use the camera on the iPhone for more Instagrams; especially for Marco and portrait shots.The main message from this review is - research all the specs and phones which will best suit your life. The S8 Plus is an expensive phone and perhaps the OnePlus 5 might be a better fit for you as it's a lower price for the same specs.Research before making a purchase."

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Jet Black	James Mitchell	5	iPhone 7 Plus Review	2016-11-05	"Design:The new iPhone is not a massive change from the 6 and 6S. It features the same rounded edges and 4.7‚Äù and 5.5‚Äù screen sizes as before, and is the 3rd in a line of an iterative design started by the 6. The most notable differences are the new Black and Jet Black finishes and the larger camera bump which is now built into the enclosure. I personally love my Jet Black finish as it looks like a mirrored surface and the front and back meet seamlessly - almost like a slab of aluminium. It also feels great in the hand with a more grippy surface than its matte siblings. I have got micro-abrasions on mine but these are only really able to be seen in bright light and in normal light are not noticeable. I have however kept my phone in a case since I received it and have seen pictures on the internet with very bad scratches on the iPhone. If you take care of it, it‚Äôll be fine.One major difference and the cause of a lot of controversy with the new iPhone has to be the headphone jack - it‚Äôs gone. I thought I‚Äôd miss this a lot more than I did. The included adapter really helps the transition and just stays plugged into my earphones from now on which doesn‚Äôt really affect me. I also own a few bluetooth headphones and these work perfectly with the new iPhone. My only gripe has been when I have wanted to use my phone for Discord or any other App that needs headphones and charge. Usually I don‚Äôt need to do this but I prefer to plug in when I am gaming to stop the phone from dropping in battery too fast. My workaround was to use bluetooth headphones for this but the other solution would be to get a splitter, something that isn‚Äôt too expensive.The main reason for removing the headphone jack in the iPhone was to increase waterproofing. The new iPhone finally gets my most desired feature. I no longer have to baby my phone in the rain or be wary when changing songs in the shower. From tests seen on the internet, the waterproofing is very good on this phone and usually better than the IP68 rating it has. Apple is usually very conservative with its rating systems and although I wouldn't suggest going swimming with the phone, it‚Äôll easily handle the odd splash or drop in the toilet. Using the phone with wet fingers or with droplets on the screen has also improved and I am very impressed with this. Before, a nearly dry hand was needed to operate the phone due to accidental inputs with the water droplets on the screen. On the new iPhone however, the rejection of these inputs has been sublime. Apple also claims a higher colour gamut screen on the iPhone which I didn't really notice but I really noticed the 25% extra brightness which helps outdoors. I would love to see an OLED display on a phone but until VR comes to the iPhone, I really think that a 1080p panel boasts the best battery life/performance/DPI ratio on a 5.5‚Äù phone.The new stereo speakers on the phone are another welcome addition I have wanted for a while. Apple claims a 50% increase in volume and I fully believe them. At max volume there is (almost) no distortion and they sound really loud - so loud I can leave my bluetooth speaker when I go to the shower. For casual listening, they are a god send. The automatic change when rotated is also great and the phone seems to output the same volume in both orientations, something I tested to see if it was the case. One thing to note with the added waterproofing is that when the speakers get wet, their volume reduces drastically and distortion is heard. This is solved when the phone dries after about 5-10 minutes but is just something to bear in mind.Performance and Camera:The performance on the iPhone 7 is just as good as the 6S. Although Apple claims a 40% increase in performance since the 6S, the UI is so smooth that you can‚Äôt notice it. It will be great for future proofing however and I welcome the change. Apple has swayed from its usual dual core chip however; the A10 is now quad-core although it doesn't use all four cores at the same time. Two are low powered cores which use 1/5 of the power of the A9 with the same performance whilst the other two are the high performance cores with the 40% increase in compute. This really ingenuous solution along with the slightly larger battery has made sure that the iPhone lasts all but the most demanding days. I regularly ended the day with 20% left which is a lot better than the basically 0% my 6S Plus used to rock up on.Both the front and rear cameras have been upgraded on the new model too. With a larger aperture, both can now take better low light photos. The front camera now takes 7MP photos and its low light performance has gotten really good - almost too good as now all my pores can be seen! The real star of the show is the back camera however. Low light performance is really good, on par with the S7, the current leader in this respect. Optical Image Stabilisation is also standard on all iPhone 7 models now which really helps with reducing the shake on videos and reducing blur in photos, especially in low light. The real step up for the 7 is the extra camera on the back (making 3 total). This camera is dubbed the ‚Äòtelephoto‚Äô lens and is a 2x zoom from the normal. This allows great zooming without loss of quality. Another thing it enables is ‚ÄòPortrait mode‚Äô, a DSLR like option which allows the background to be blurred out. This, although still in beta, seems to be really good and has produced some amazing shots, better than any compact camera I have used and rivalling (not replacing) DSLR quality at first look.Software Experience:The new iPhone 7s all ship with iOS 10, Apple‚Äôs latest iteration of its mobile software. It does away with some things, namely ‚ÄòSlide to Unlock‚Äô, a legacy Apple creation and has now been replaced with ‚ÄòPress Home to Unlock‚Äô. This new method of unlock is really great for phones with Touch ID (not so great for non-Touch ID but that‚Äôs a different story) and along with raise to wake, makes your phone just seem more alive and useful. The widgets when swiping left are really useful for quick glances. I will look up my next lecture or check what reminders I have with a quick swipe and that will be it, a lot more convenient than before.3D touch has been getting better and better and the new lock screen combined with 3D Touch has just become a really great experience. 3D Touching on a Notification will bring up quick actions and even sometimes an actual window with previews of messages. This is an ingenious feature which has really helped with quick replies and is just something that is fun to do. Before, 3D Touch was limited to previewing and shortcuts and now it is so much more. So many apps take advantage of it for extra content, quick settings and its convenience and tight integration is something you don‚Äôt find on any other smartphone. I have got used to shortcuts from my 6S and now use a few, not as many as Apple may hope but enough to justify it as a feature.One of my favourite features about the new iPhone 7 has to be the Taptic Engine. It has been improved since the 6S to now vibrate on some other things happening in the system. For example pulling down the notification shade causes a small bump when it hits the bottom, when scrolling through the different minutes in the clock app, it will give a small bump at each one it scrolls past. Although these may seem like small things, this really gives the iPhone a mechanical feel which is really nice. I actively seek out ways to use these things as they just feel so futuristic whilst retro at the same time, a throwback to the mechanical days.This Taptic Engine is also used to power the home button. No longer a physical switch, the home button is now a solid state button that activates when it senses a force on it. At first I was not so sure about the button. It feels different to anything I have used before and sometimes can feel like the whole bottom of the phone is moving. However, I quickly became used to it and now prefer it to anything else. It never fails and feels quite realistic and I welcome a change that will reduce the fragileness of a button whilst also improving its waterproofing capabilities.Durability:‚Ä®Over my month and a bit with the phone, I have (as mentioned) picked up a few micro abrasions on the phone. It goes everywhere with me; the gym, rock climbing, lectures, excursions and so on and looks almost new. I do use a screen protector however and over one of the parts where it is not covered, I have picked up a small scratch. I don‚Äôt baby my phone however. As it is all solid state I will chuck the phone on a desk and take it to places other people wouldn‚Äôt take it like rock climbing where chalk and the constant fear of people falling on your phone is rife. I really like the waterproofing of the phone as it means I can run it under a tap when done to wash off anything. I have had back protectors (like screen protectors but for the back of the phone) on however to reduce the risk of scratches however my first application didn‚Äôt go too well. When removing the film, I did notice that some of the markings were coming off the phone. These have just got fainter and are hard to see in normal light. I actually prefer this however as I never really liked the markings on the back of the phone however might be annoying when trying to read the serial number or any important information.Conclusion:The iPhone 7 is a great phone. After all the negativity of the removal of the headphone jack, it seems that many people actually can go without it, especially with the inclusion of an adapter in the box. The iPhone 7 has quite a few more features that do warrant its 7 name and its camera has been significantly upgraded in the low light department, taking really good pictures in the dark. Before with the 6S, I could see more in the dark than it, but the 7 seems to be able to pick up more than I can. I truly believe that this phone can sit with other flagship phones of 2016."
iPhone 7 Plus	256GB	Silver	Chris Radford	5	Why I came back to Apple following the death of the Note 7....	2016-10-27	"My relationship with Android lasted for six weeks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Here‚Äôs why I came back to Apple following the death of the Note 7.I was one of the lucky people who got their hands on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on pre-order launch day!! Yes for the first time in almost a decade, I had decided to move away from Apple iPhones and give Android a try.  How did that go for me though?  Well I can honestly say that I really loved many things about the Note 7 and by association, the Android platform.  Then the first recall happened.  I was slightly irritated!! Then the final ‚Äògive it back NOW please‚Äô.I looked around at an alternative to the Note 7.  My criteria were‚Ä¶‚Ä¶- 5.5‚Äù or larger screen- Fast processor and lots of RAM- Better than average battery life- Lots of storage space- Top quality camera- WaterproofThere were a couple of Samsung features that I really loved, but I knew I had to live without them if I wanted a premium device that wasn‚Äôt Samsung - wireless charging being the main one.So why the iPhone 7 Plus then?  Looking at my list of requirements, I couldn‚Äôt find a single alternative that could offer all of these features that WASN‚ÄôT the iPhone.  I remember watching the Apple keynote about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with my Note 7 in my hand, almost hoping that it would be a disappointment.  Sadly the only gripe that I could find was the lack of the 3.5mm headphone socket.  I‚Äôve found a solution to that problem which cost around ¬£15 - Mpow Streambot Mini Bluetooth 4.0 A2DP Wireless Receiver Adapter for Audio Streaming System and Car Kits.  So I‚Äôve had the iPhone 7 Plus for about two weeks now and here‚Äôs my early review.Form FactorI have to say that I love the feel of the iPhone 7 Plus.  The silver model looks beautiful naked.  It‚Äôs slightly slippery in the hand so if you‚Äôre not going to use a case, I recommend a good quality skin or you‚Äôre going to drop it.  Apple have redesigned the phone to make the antenna bands less visible, and they‚Äôve got it spot on.  The sleep/wake button, slightly redesigned volume buttons and the mute switch are all in the same place, as is the home key, but this is one of the major redesigns for 2016 - the home key is no longer a physical button.  Apple have used their Taptic Engine to trick your finger into believing you‚Äôve pressed a button, and it really does work.  Whether you want to wake up your phone, launch Siri or close an app, the brand new home key let‚Äôs you know that it‚Äôs received your command with a little buzz.  There‚Äôs even a choice of how much feedback you get from the button.  In my opinion, this great new feature also means that there‚Äôs one less piece of hardware to fail and it also forms a part of how the phone has become water resistant.DisplayLet‚Äôs be honest, Apple don‚Äôt seem to lead the field in mobile phone displays right now.  They don‚Äôt seem to have increased the pixel density of their displays since the iPhone 4‚Äôs launch of the Retina display.  That said, the iPhone 7 Plus offers a much improved ‚Äòwide colour gamut‚Äô.  That means a far more real reproduction on your display than previous models.  Comparing this to the Galaxy Note 7 or S7 (the same display), it‚Äôs clear to see that Apple have made an improvement here, and you could argue that the human eye can‚Äôt distinguish between the quality of displays beyond 400ppi so it really becomes about manufacturer spec-boasting.  As I review my photos, I feel that they are more alive than ever.  Added to this, the 3D Touch feature, which I felt was a bit of a white elephant last year, really comes into its own now.  More and more 3rd party apps have embraced the concept and now you can use force touch to simplify tasks.  No other brand offers this technology right now and it wasn‚Äôt until I started using it again, after my six weeks in the Samsung wilderness, that I realised how much I‚Äôve missed it.CameraWhat can I say about the iPhone 7 Plus camera?  One word - WOW.  iOS 10.1 brought with it the fantastic ‚ÄòPortrait Mode‚Äô update, promised in the iPhone 7 launch keynote.  This is Apple‚Äôs best ever camera and it truly is the best camera I have ever owned.  Not only is it lightning fast to launch - take the phone out of your pocket and raise it to eye level, swipe to the left and bang it‚Äôs ready to shoot - but everything about it is improved.  The all-new wide colour gamut on the display gives you a much more reliable preview of your picture before you shoot, focusing is quick and reliable and the new telephoto lens allows for 2x optical zoom which really does make a difference.  It also means that the phone is capable of 10x digital zoom to a much higher quality.  The difference between this camera and the 6S is really noticeable.Portrait mode is a breakthrough.  Some Android phones have tried to mimic this feature, but Apple use a mixture of hardware and software ‚Äòmachine learning‚Äô to give an effect that you would only normally find from a DSLR and a talented photographer.  I find it hard to take a photo without trying to use this mode now, and the results I‚Äôve had in just a few days of the update are remarkable.  All in all, the latest iPhone snapper is a stand-out feature.WaterproofingHotly anticipated for the iPhone 7 / 7 Plus was some kind of waterproofing.  Many reviewers believed the 6S to be waterproof but I for one didn‚Äôt ever put that to the test.  Apple have achieved this for 2016 by making a few changes - the SIM tray now has a rubber seal, there is no earphone socket letting water in and the home key is software based rather than a hardware ‚Äòbutton‚Äô.  All of those boring details give you a phone that can take a few splashes.  Apple say that you can submerge the phone is 1.5m of water for 30 minutes and have rated it IP67, making it officially water RESISTANT.  They have quite cleverly excluded water damage from the warranty though so please beware if you‚Äôre going for a dip.  I feel a lot more confident with my phone in my hand near water or around the washing up bowl, and I am delighted to be able to listen to music in the shower, though I still keep my 7 Plus well away from getting drowned.StorageThe Cupertino posse treated us to an increase in storage space this year.  Whilst there is still (and probably this will never change) no microSD slot, the base iPhone 7 now has 32GB of storage.  I‚Äôve plumped for the 256GB, flagship model.  It means I‚Äôm unlikely to ever have a problem when taking lots of photos or video and I can store enough music to last for weeks of listening.  It‚Äôs good that Apple have listened to their customers‚Äô need for more storage space, but I really wish they would think about adding removable storage‚Ä¶.Battery LifeAnother year, another increase in battery life!!  This year Apple have treated us to quite a bump up in juice.  I‚Äôve been getting a consistent 12 hours of unplugged use with my 7 Plus by virtue of the new 2900 mAr cell compared to 10 hours in last year‚Äôs 2750 mAr offering.  I‚Äôm somebody who has battery percentage paranoia and I feel totally confident to go about my daily business without an emergency charger in sight.  Compared to my doomed Note 7 with its 3500 mAhr, Apple seem to use their home-grown link between software and hardware to offer an unbelievably good battery life.  Added to that, the recently added ‚Äòlow power‚Äô mode can add hours of extra life if you get caught without a charger for a long period of time.ProcessorThe latest A10 Fusion chip gives a multi-core Geekbench score of 5645 compared to the now defunked Note 7‚Äôs 5617.  In reality though, the iPhone 7 Plus massively outperforms Samsung‚Äôs 7 series phones by a country mile.  This could well be in part due to the deeper integration between software and hardware in Apple‚Äôs products, along with generally better quality apps in the Apple App Store.  Games seem to render faster and better and even with the Samsung developer tweaks, the iPhone still outperforms in transitions from home screen to app and vice versa.  The improved in-house designed A10 Fusion processor is further augmented by the additional 1GB RAM present in the iPhone 7 Plus.Earphone SocketI must confess that one of the worst kept secrets of the iPhone 7 was the removal of the 3.5mm earphone socket, and for me this was a problem.  A few weeks in and I have yet to use to bundled ‚Äòlightning EarPods‚Äô or the lightning to 3.5mm jack adapter.  Instead I‚Äôve embraced bluetooth 4 and now use a fantastic device from Mpow which cost around ¬£15 and allows me to plug in any old earphones into a ridiculously small box which receives a bluetooth signal from my iPhone.  The battery lasts around 10 hours with a 1.5 hour charge.  So who needs an earphone socket?  Well as a professional DJ and entertainer, my phone has always been an emergency fall-back device incase my MacBook suddenly fails, but for that to work for me I now need to carry around some kind of lightning adapter AND ensure that my phone has got enough battery as there is no way to charge the phone and play music through the lightning port at the same time.  I‚Äôm sure there will be an Apple approved solution to this problem some time soon, and once there is, one will definitely live in my laptop bag!!Virus and Malware Protection and Software UpdatesAs a long - term Apple user, both Mac and iOS, I have become used to the hassle - free nature of the marriage between software and hardware.  The area where this is by far the most apparent is in virus protection.  I can remember the darker days of Windows where the most innocent of email attachments could cause the world to come crashing down and my PC to completely stop working.  It seems that these issues are still very present within the non - iOS community, as I found when WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger both stopped working on my Android handset.  I couldn‚Äôt quite believe that this was happening on a 2016, flagship device, but it seems that I have been spoiled with Tim Cook‚Äôs gang and their commitment to keeping our devices and data safe.  If none of the features above have convinced you, take a moment to consider a world where you don‚Äôt have to worry about viruses.  Comforting though‚Ä¶.Apple users are also blessed with regular-as-clockwork software updates.  You can set your watch on Apple‚Äôs schedule of releases of their iOS platform, and the statistics are astounding.  As of 27th October 2016, 60% of iPhone users are already running iOS 10, which was only released three weeks ago, compared to only 1% of Android users running version 7 which has been out for quite some time longer.  Even now, only 19% of Android users are running version 6, which was released in 2015!!!  Those are shocking statistics which are also very reassuring for Apple users as every update of iOS includes security patches that keep our devices safe from virus and malware attacks.So these are my thoughts on the iPhone 7 Plus 256GB.  As it turns out, it outperforms Samsung‚Äôs flagship 7 series devices is every feature with the exception of the earphone socket.  It seems like the demise of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time for me as it saved me from myself and brought me back home to where my heart belongs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"

It is a brilliant devise and a pleasure to use. The camera function is superb. The phone is perfect in every way.A few days ago I have accidentally put it into the washing machine. It went through a 40C wash/spin cycle at 1200RPM. I was very distressed and thought I have ruined my phone but when I've turned it on, it worked perfectly. I have tested most of the functions, including the camera and so far everything is in order.The iphone 7 is meant to be waterproof but I very much doubt Apple tested it in a washing machine. I can definitely say that it IS waterproof."

iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Jet Black	PTZ	4	Pricey but good allrounder	2017-05-07	"Screen -This 1080p screen is very good. I have been a long-time fan of vivid displays by Samsung, and this display is just about vibrant. The highest brightness level is very good.The fairly adequate resolution helps to give a clear screen.But to be honest, a 1080p screen is good enough at this size (5.5 inches diagonally).Build Quality-Very good. In par with The Samsung S8 and Google Pixel phone. Non removable back. No big improvement in design since the IPhone 6 plus though.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, specially for a phone. Not as powerful as the dual speakers of say the Axon 7.But then its in par with the Samsung S7 series. No headphone jack, hence they have provided an adaptor for that, to plug in your old earphones. The other alternative would be to use a wireless headphone.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag. Have not had any issues so far with sluggishness or re-starts etc. However, some android phones get marginally slower after about 6 months of use. You would note that IPhone has considerably lower RAM than the counterpart Android phones.But I have not seen this impacting, on performance.Added features-Micro SD slot is not available to expand memory. But inbuilt 128GB storage is more than adequate for photos etc, as well as some movies if you fancy.This phone is IP67 water resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP dual lens back camera. Very good photos in good daylight. Acceptable low light photos, but not as good as the Samsung Galaxy S7 series. The front camera is good, but could have been better.Good for a quick selfie but nothing fantastic.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good. However, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon.Battery-Very good 2900mAH battery. There is no quick charge function. But you may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one and half days of use on this, if you are a casual user. If you are a power user, still likely you may just about survive a day.Price-The recommended retail price for this is ¬£819, which is quite steep. Bare in mind that the after sales support is quite robust for a year though. When buying through third parties look at the  following- are they locked/unlocked. Haas it got 1 year Apple warranty (if its a used product it may not have full year left)Final words on Jet Black- This is a really sleek colour. But a fingerprint magnet and very much prone to scratches. I would definitely recommend using a case. Even when you put on a case, I would recommend cleaning it every week with a wet piece of cloth, since the dust particles which get in, could scratch the device."
iPhone 7 Plus	128GB	Jet Black	Joel T	5	Switched me from android	2017-08-02	"After being a android customer for years, my brother, who works at apple, finally convinced me to switch to iOS when the iPhone 7 plus was announced.  I have had my phone for 8 months now and I can safely say it's by far the best mobile device I've ever owned.  Everything is integrated and easy to use, the camera takes great photos, the speakers are louder and higher quality than the phones of everyone else that I know, the screen is super high resolution and the battery lasts a day and a half before it needs charging (though I usually charge my phone overnight).  I didn't originally purchase my iPhone from Amazon, so I can't comment on the delivery time or things like that, but the phone itself is a must buy if, like me, your phone has become an essential part of daily life.  Attached are 3 photos taken using my camera on my phone."

My first smart-phone, but I already have a mini-iPad so have found it mostly intuitive, more so than my daughter's Windows phone.Be aware that although sold SIM-free, i-Phones not bought direct from Apple or other selected resellers (e.g. John Lewis) will become locked to the network of the first SIM inserted.  I was not aware of this until I read the seller's warning included with the package, which also included the option to return the phone unopened if this was not acceptable.  It was not a problem for me, so I was able to accept the phone, but my wife recently tried to change to a different provider's SIM in her i-Phone and is having great difficulty getting her original SIM-only provider to unlock it."

Superficially the phone is in very good condition indeed. I cannot see any marks or flaws at all. Regrettably the battery life is shockingly poor. New to me on an i phone there is information on battery performance and this phone arrived with 78%, this was its optimum performance capability. In reality that means I am getting less than two hours usage between charges which is not good by any standard, given this is a refurbished phone it would have been useful for such vital information to be included in the advert. I am now forced to obtain a new battery which makes the initially attractive cost of this phone greater than I had hoped. An almost perfect product ruined through lack of information by the seller."

I found the phone to be locked to EE, despite the unlocked description. I took it to a market stall to be unlocked, at a cost of ¬£30. Once unlocked, (2 days) I am very pleased with the phone. Works well, and battery life good. Also very pleased that Amazon refunded the ¬£30 spent un locking it. Now I am pleased with the deal, but it was a little frustrating getting there.."

After much chasing by myself with both Amazon and Apple neither Apple or Amazon could help with my suggestion that somebody check the stock of these phones as it would seem that there could be a faulty batch in circulation. I had to come up with my own solution, which was to order a different colour phone and return the replacement. The different colour phone works. Again not impressed with support from Amazon or Apple"

iPhone 6S	32GB	Rose Gold	PTZ	4	"Good phone, still good despite being released 18 months back.."	2017-05-07	"Screen -This 750 x 1334 screen is very good. I have been a long-time fan of vivid displays by Samsung, and this display is just about vibrant. The highest brightness level is very good.The fairly adequate resolution helps to give a clear screen.But to be honest, this screen is good enough at this size (4.7 inches diagonally).Build Quality-Very good. In par with The Samsung S8 and Google Pixel phone. Non removable back. No big improvement in design since the IPhone 6 though. The force touch is new for the 6s series, but not very useful (atleast yet) in my opinion.Sound-Loud and clear. No issues, specially for a phone. Not as powerful as the dual speakers of say the Axon 7.But then its in par with the Samsung S7 series. No headphone jack, hence they have provided an adaptor for that, to plug in your old earphones. The other alternative would be to use a wireless headphone.Responsiveness-Very good, no lag. Have not had any issues so far with sluggishness or re-starts etc. However, some android phones get marginally slower after about 6 months of use. You would note that IPhone has considerably lower RAM than the counterpart Android phones.But I have not seen this impacting, on performance.Added features-Micro SD slot is not available to expand memory. But inbuilt 32GB storage is more than adequate for photos etc, but probably not any high quality movies etc.This phone is not water resistant.Cameras-Very good 12MP single lens back camera. Note that this camera has no dual lens like the ""plus"" model.Very good photos in good daylight. Acceptable low light photos, but not as good as the Samsung Galaxy S7 series. The front camera is good, but could have been better.Good for a quick selfie but nothing fantastic.Guarantee-Apple has 1 year manufacturer's warranty on the phone, and they are pretty good. However, if it's fulfilled by Amazon, you would still have 1 year warranty from Amazon.Battery-Very good 1715 mAH battery. There is no quick charge function. But you may notice that all phones which have quick charge, are relatively faster at discharge too. You could easily make one day of use on this, if you are a casual user. If you are a power user, still you may struggle to survive a day.Price-The recommended retail price for this is ¬£499, which is quite steep. Bare in mind that the after sales support is quite robust for a year though. When buying through third parties look at the following-Are they locked/unlocked.Has it got 1 year Apple warranty (if its a used product it may not have full year left)Do you get all original accessories with boxFinal words on colour- This is a favourite for sometime now. But may look a bit discoloured after sometime (on the front).This is not a problem with Apple, and generally is an issue with all white coloured phones."
iPhone 6S	32GB	Space Grey	James	1	Beautiful phone with rubbish software	2017-06-23	"I got this phone as a free upgrade and it lasted 4 days before I sent it back. First thing I did was upgrade to iOS 10.3. I work on the road and my phone is everything. I installed hear maps which I always used on my s5. Voice navigation did not work. Installed Google maps, voice navigation worked for 30 minutes and only when I was on the exact route. Set a course for London from Ipswich it completely failed. Notifications had no sounds most of the time. I tried calling my provider and selecting the options on the ivr , selecting the numbers on the phone did nothing. Getting an s7 now. Like buying an Alfa, blinded by beauty but rubbish reliability under the bonnet. Never again."

I always buy the cheapest NEW iPhone available, which happens to be the 6s at the moment, and the 6s is the same on the inside as the SE.

But as I have my old one I use that so not a problem. Apart from that the phone is perfect, I have had no issues with it except that it needed the ios upgrading which means the phone has been sat on a shelf for a while.
