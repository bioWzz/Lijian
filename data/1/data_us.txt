iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Mercuryball	1	Save your money.	2019-02-05	"The most expensive POS to come out of Apple. It‚Äôs a $200 phone for $1000 bucks. If took the same money and put it towards a great camera you would have a professional camera and could buy a simple phone. Apple has duped us once again. By far the worst apple purchase I have made. My last time I buy a phone from this overindulgent company that puts more thought into its packaging than its products. Basically the overpriced less impressive model that Starbucks and Apple have milked us for for years. Learning that Apple no longer is innovative...it follows an ever growing pack of cheaper, more stylish competitors."

iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	Gary B	1	Defective out of the box	2019-02-26	"I purchased this xs to replace my 6 plus. Once I got it home, I noticed it would not hook up to cellular data. I also noticed that I had to swipe it two or three times or more to get it to open up. The facial recognition was very slow and sometimes wanted the pass code entered.  When I went to reset it, I couldn‚Äôt get it too shut down. It felt like the on off button was not connecting properly. Went back to the store, and the tech went through the same things I did with no success. They wanted me to go outside the store and try the cellular data. I did that with no success. It would make calls and text, but not send or receive photos or data.I decided right then and there, after using 2 hours of my time, I was going return this defective device. I need more reliable equipment for use in my business. I‚Äôm a pilot. After paying $1000 plus for it, I was disappointed. I will reactivate my 6 plus, which never let me down, and then consider all other options. They offered to replace the phone with a refurbished unit, or send it in for repair. But since it‚Äôs brand new, I can return it per the store policy. I Just don‚Äôt feel good about how this has worked out but definitely don‚Äôt want to keep this 10s."
iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Customer	5	Got me to end using Android phones forever	2019-04-07	"This is my second iPhone. My first was one of the early models, and I eventually switched to Android phones for quite a while. When this came out, I loved the increased usable screen area. I immediately purchased one and have loved everything about it. I upgraded to the 256gb model and have way more than enough storage to keep everything I want on the phone. The battery life really amazed me. I use the phone for both business and personal use, so it stays pretty busy. I have never had to recharge the phone before the end of the business day. And the recharge time is very short - it recharges from 20% to fully charged amazingly quickly. The camera takes great pictures. When zooming in, the definition is still perfect. The Face ID is wonderful. I use it for almost everything and it is very accurate, logging me in almost every time. The only times it doesn't seem to work is in low lighting, which only makes sense. Overall this is a fantastic phone, I'm glad that I spent the money, and I will never go back to Android."
iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	CS	1	"Buyer Bewarer - Lost music, New headphone"	2019-05-05	"We purchased this phone through a Verizon trade in.  By far, the worst upgrade in my 10-year history of Apple Phones.  Not only did I lose 65% of all the songs I painstakingly burned and created playlists for, but the headphones end connector has changed as well .  It is non-universal so you will not be able to use the new headphones on planes or other devices like tablets or computers. The music I lost wasn‚Äôt pre-cloud.  Nevertheless, Apple Support was very nonchalant about this loss.  They say they are ‚Äúpushing‚Äù all users to subscribe to Apple Music!  Shame on you, Apple!  We‚Äôre switching to another product."

iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	Matthew	2	I love Apple but hate this iPhone model	2018-11-04	"I recently upgraded from an iPhone 6, which I had no issues with at all, other than it being antiquated. In fact, I loved the phone and all of the features. I'll make this review easy by simply listing the pros and cons.Pros:-Waterproof (allegedly)-Larger screen and better graphics-Better camera quality than ever beforeCons:-Insanely expensive-Facial recognition is not that great. It works about 70% of the time and doesn't work randomly, for unknown reasons-The processor is supposed to be faster but it is constantly lagging when using apps and I'm nowhere close to capacity-With the home button gone, you have to swipe up from the bottom to close apps. This is problematic when using certain apps because I often inadvertently swipe up (when playing a game, for instance) and close the app-The battery life is supposed to be better than previous models, however I don't notice a difference. The phone also takes a bit longer to fully charge"

iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	Abe Addler	1	No Manual Functions on Video Camera	2018-10-29	"I got the iPhone XS and returned it 3 hrs. later. I'm a filmmaker by trade and thought this could be a breakthrough in filmmaking especially with a high-end 4k camera on board. I got the phone home anxiously opened it up and went to the camera functions right away since that's all I care about, a phone is just a phone otherwise. Well, I shot some 4k footage, looked nice but now I need to see how creative I can get. I looked for the manual shutter speed control, there isn't one. I looked for the manual white balance, there isn't one. I looked. I looked for the manual ISO setting, not there. I looked for the manual aperture setting, doesn't have it. So basically its camera is not intended for any kind of production, it's really a point and shoot. The HDR feature is nice but again, no manual settings. Not production friendly at all. 3 hours later I repacked it and returned it and got the LGV40. Now I'll do a review on that as well but the IPhone XS doesn't even come close to the LGV40 in any shape or form."
iPhone XS	64GB	Silver	N. Sims	3	Lightning port earphone dock STILL huge design flaw...	2018-10-13	"O.K. folks, I love the camera on my new Xs, it is way better than my 6 or my SE. The screen res. and size are great as well. However... Apple has put its heels down on the not reinstating a 3.5 port for ear buds/phones and that, for me, is a really big problem.  We are all reduced to using wireless phones or buds with all their inherent battery usage problems, OR, ear buds made expressly for lightning port connection - with their terrible flimsiness and proclivity to bend  or break.  This may be redundant or not important to many - but I hope that this review may give those pause who find this an important issue, and perhaps ever so slightly cajole Apple to reconsider either re-adding the 3.5 port, or making their lightning cable connection more robust. I have gone through 2 pairs of lightning port  ear buds, and 2 apple lightning to 3.5 adapters. Very frustrating.  Makes the Samsung Galaxy9 (with it's 3.5 headphone jack) really appealing."
iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Reynolds	3	Great phone but it WILL break.	2019-03-21	My first Apple product. Lots of neat features in handling like face recognition and password/login applicability.Very cumbersome with many artificial limitations doing email attachments through the mail application and even through the gmail app.Casing is HORRENDOUS. Looks cool for 4 days but is so slick and slippery that both cases on my phone and my wife‚Äôs phone shattered within 5 days. It will slide off your bed/counter/desk/out of your pocket/everything. Apple chose to make the case out of cheap glass. You will live in a state of anxiety given that the included cord is too short for practical use and is still heavy enough to pull the phone off its surface and to the floor several times a day regardless of the precautions you take.
iPhone XS	64GB	Space Gray	Amazon Customer	1	Cant wait to go back to android!	2019-05-31	"I just got my first iPhone ever, and Ive had it for over a month...and its TERRIBLE!-phone volume controls all sound, including alarms, ringtones, media and any bluetooth device youre connected to. horrible setup. especially if you want the Alarm you have set to wake you up, but dont want phone calls or messages to bother you. and for the bluetooth this is really frustrating because you cant use the full volume range of the speaker without distortion of the sound, because you cant balance the input volume to the speaker with the playback volume.-touch response is terrible. about half the time I try scrolling up, the phone scrolls left to the previous page or screen. rather frustrating, and just plain annoying-battery life okay, but not great, especially if youre actually using the phone, it dies fast-camera takes amazing photos, AS LONG AS YOU ARE VIEWING THEM ON AN APPLE SCREEN, as soon as you display them on anything else, its just another photo from a phone camera- no expandable storage? oh thats right, so they can sell me cloud storage thats so clearly easy to hack...no thanks- lots of other pointless and not intuitive operation methods, like, to edit an alarm, you have to select edit, then the alarm, and to edit another, you gotta go back up and hit edit again....why design this way? zero user fluidity...ALSO, wanna click on the notification to open it? nah, you gotta slide to right to open and left for other operations, or slide it up for a faster go away response, which is the same as swipe left option, so again redundant, non-fluid operation that could easily be designed another way.My first iPhone will be my last. I gave it some time, but this entire setup and function design is really far from intuitive or fluid. I finally truly realize why everyone I know in program engineering or computer science has an Android.I know theyre popular, but like...The united states is literally known in part for its poor education and stupidity...no wonder this country loves this phone!!!"
iPhone XS	64GB	Gold	K. Pomp	2	Where‚Äôs the home button??	2019-03-31	"This is the fourth iPhone I have had and by far the worst. This is the first time I have purchased a new iPhone and not been happy with the changes/improvements they made.  Them getting rid of the home button is a monumental mistake, that‚Äôs what really set iPhone apart before. Phone has good battery life and I like the camera features but would‚Äôve been happy just to keep my iPhone 7."

iPhone XS Max	64GB	Silver	Ohrwurm	1	Too heavy - too bulky - not modern	2019-01-26	"I had an iPhone 6 Plus. Which was the big one. So I got the iPhone XS MAX on purpose. I wanted the big one (because I use it a lot for mobile film making & photography). I expected to be extremely happy with my new phone. The camera(s) are supposed to be very good. Now the report: The camera(s) are indeed great. BUT: The microphones on this model are abysmal. Very bad. It is a real issue, frequently discussed in on-line forums. Only I did not learn about it until after the purchase. Voices sounds muffled and unnatural, both receiving and accepting calls. But not all the time. The second severe downside is the weight of the iPhone XS MAX. It is 1.2 oz heavier than the old Plus 6. A BIG minus, though it seems small. It is also thicker. Very clunky and unhandy. It feels truly old-fashioned in one's hands. Not sleek. There is no joy in actually handling this baby. A very, very misguided and unattractive design for end-users.  I am returning the iPhone XS MAX. No wonder, Apple had to lower the price for the XS series in China. They have much more modern phones there. PS.: I am an Apple fan. I have all devices Apple. But this is a serious dud."

iPhone XR	64GB	Black	Victor Razon	4	Great overall phone for the price	2019-04-22	"Hello, my name is Victor and I am a student. I have been using Apple products for five years. I saw this product on multiple commercials and after doing my own research on it I decided to buy it. Some of the best features of this product are its long battery life, user-friendly interface, and low price. The iPhone Xr has the longest battery life out of all the iPhones in its generation and it lasts me the whole day without any problems. Its user interface is also very easy to navigate which makes things very convenient. The best part about this phone is its price starting at $750, compared to other iPhones that cost $1000 and above. There are some negatives to this phone, however. The camera, screen resolution and it is not durable without a case. The camera on this phone is subpar compared to other iPhones in this generation which is to be expected at its given price point. The screen is also subpar to the other iPhones as it can only go up to 1080p resolution compared to 4k. The glass on the back of the phone leaves much to be desired as it can easily shatter without protection from a case. Overall, this phone does have its drawbacks, but it is still a great buy."

Maybe five stars is much but I have no complaints about the phone. My complaints or with iOS so can‚Äôt blame the device. Sleek look. Smooth function. Light and big exactly what I like.

Face recognition works every time and I can't find any feature that doesn't work flawlessly.  No more fingerprint ID, I just have to look at it and only takes a split second.  6.1 display vs the 4.7 I had with my old phone.  I'm getting used to the new navigation methods, but once I learned them I think they are great and much faster.  No more home button, but who needs it!  I have researched the new features and if you do too, you will learn to love it."
iPhone XR	64GB	Red	Joan	5	Superior Performance and Value	2019-06-12	"I have been with my Carrier for >than 20years now, so it was natural for me to go to them to buy my new phone, the XR, 64 GB. Except for buying the phone directly from Apple (Different considerations at Apple, though at first glance, price seems lower than buying phone elsewhere), I choose to forgo the Apple deal for many reasons including: I prefer to keep my new device for as many years as possible v only one year that Apple encourages; I have an established relationship with my regular carrier, including established credit.I do not understand this phone only working with one carrier. That must be connected to being an Amazon purchase. To my knowledge you may purchase any of the XR phones/any color from multiple carriers. It is just that I am a frequent Amazon customer and so I thought I would focus on reviewing the actual product, even though I purchased it elsewhere.I am also astounded by the mixed, overly negative reviews of the XR on this sit!e! If you read outside reviewers, including one in Forbes, you will see just how highly this phone is recommended, especially for the price. Search for multiple professional reviews elsewhere, do no take my word for it.I am physically disabled and no longer drive. So I purchased this phone online and subsequently via a phone call. I looked at the reviews at my carrier‚Äôs website before picking it. The fact that EVERY single review on their site was 5-stars helped me make my decision. That, plus the ‚ÄúRELATIVELY lower‚Äù price of $749 v $1095 for the X was also a huge factor influencing my decision. As for the 64 GB, that is what I use on my iPhone 6 and iPad Mini 4. It works for me. Importantly, I got a great deal on my phone, the advertised $100, plus another $100 that I negotiated myself. My net cost was $549, plus tax.  Shipping  of the xr & the return of the 6 was free (and prompt) both ways.From my decision making process, I want to review the actual phone! This will be short because the xr is as advertised. The battery life, which is the best of ALL iPhones-which I read online from independent reviewers-is consistent with my personal experience with the xr. Having had iPhones forever, I am blown away by how long the xr‚Äôs charge lasts‚Äîthat is, only 1/3-1/2 of the battery is used over 24-36 hours.As for negative considerations, I have identified two minor ones: In settings, where you set how long you want to keep the phone on before it automatically turns off, your only choices are 1-5 minutes. I prefer the 15 minutes on the iPhone 6; I also prefer the Sounds of the iPhone 6-for example, when my alarm rings, it sounds a bit thin or ‚Äútinny,‚Äù lacking some resonance. I suspect I‚Äôll adjust to resonance issue over time. I have only had the phone for a couple of weeks.There are my own thoughts and observations. Overall, I highly recommend the iPhone XR. Additionally, the xr is a fantastic  value  when compared to other iPhones."

iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	David	4	Read the description carefully	2019-01-03	"I bought this iPhone before they changed the title and added [Locked to SimpleMobile]. The title exclusively said (unlocked) so I purchased this expecting an unlocked device.On arrival I unboxed the phone, the box was not open or damaged so it was a pretty decent experience. The trouble started when I put my T-Mobile SIM card in only to get the invalid SIM card message. I couldn‚Äôt get to the home screen or anything.I went back to Amazon to closely inspect the description, and sure enough at the very very bottom it said it was locked to SimpleMobile. No surprise here, but it was strongly misleading when the title stated it was UNLOCKED (hence why they finally changed the title now).But besides that it‚Äôs a brand new phone, no other complaints. Comes with all the original accessories. Only word of advice next time is to read the entire description carefully (at least skim it over)"

Everything works fine only issue is that it doesn‚Äôt come with headphones but that‚Äôs fine because I paid a great price! Would recommend buying from wireless mall sales I don‚Äôt know the quality of the other providers.

iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Samuel	5	"Who needs headphones? The sound of music was never better from a ""speaker phone."""	2017-01-20	"I know conventional wisdom says start with the carrier and strike your bargain from there.  But I knew it would have to be an iPhone, and my wife, moreover, insisted I accompany her to the Apple Store for my birthday gift--any Apple phone I chose.I went in with every intention to to get an iPhone 6S, since the lack of a headphone jack strikes me as impractical if not preposterous.  After auditioning 5-6 models, I left the store with the iPhone 7 Plus. The decision was simple--based primarily on one single criterion: the quality of the SOUND of MUSiC played back from the onboard speakers.The sales clerk suggested I not dismiss the 7 too quickly on the basis of the headphone jack omission.  First, the phone comes with an adapter that can be placed over your headphone pin and plugged into the charging port (that helps, especially given the collection of headphones I've acquired).  More importantly, the iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone with: 1. stereo (2) speakers; 2. pretty good (for a phone) speakers.The clerk then fired up a busy superhero movie score on the 4-5 iPhones I was considering.  Not helpful.  The clerk suggested pulling up any tune I wished through the store's Apple Music Subscription.  I went with Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue,"" which begins with Bill Evans rubato piano, then goes into tempo with Paul Chambers' acoustic bass (on ""So What"") in a call-response exchange between bass and ensemble.Using the iPhone 6s, with a single speaker, the bass was all but absent (the store was quite noisy).  Moving to the iPhone7 Plus, Chambers' bass walked right out of the phone speakers and into my ear, each pitch identifiable along with string ""buzz"" and extra-musical ""fingering"" noise.  Suddenly the question of the headphone jack was rendered meaningless.  The combination of stereo sound plus slightly more powerful, larger speakers was all I would need to get maximum value from the phone.I'm a hobbyist musician (piano), and I no longer practice with a notated score. All I require is a player (and a piano) to learn a tune, and a device like the iPhone 7 Plus makes learning new tunes easier than ever.I'm also a photographer of sorts, and the wider lens for unprecedented clarity shooting with available light as well as a feature permitting razor-sharp focus on a subject in the foreground and blurred-out focus on figures in the immediate background struck me as more than a novelty.  With my 35mm film cameras (Pentax Spotmatics), I'd have to switch to an expensive, long and heavy zoom lens to achieve the same effect.I've read that Apple may be planning on a blockbuster iPhone 8 with an OLED (curved) screen.  I think I can leave the curves to Marilyn Monroe or a Cinerama production..  The 7Plus should last me and, though it's a tad big and cumbersome as a phone, it should be harder to misplace and/or lose than the previous half a dozen ""candy-bar phones"" were.  (I don't need more than 1GB for using the phone, but 128GB is enough to carry a generous supply of music tracks and space for making videos).Only problems: finding the best carrier for the least money and unloading three barely used cell phones (2 Jitterbugs and a Spark Aquos Crystal--good screen but artificially ""enhanced"" sound and barely accessible controls, if you can find them)."
iPhone 7 Plus	32GB	Black	Alexis B.	4	The Incredible 7	2017-02-23	"I‚Äôve been an iPhone user for years now and I‚Äôve had the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and the iPhone 6s. Currently, I am a user of the iPhone 7 plus. Now that I own an iPhone 7 plus and have adjusted to using it, I can speak on both the advantages and disadvantages that come with the phone. For instance, Apple decided to add a double camera which I think is a good enhancement because it helps to improve the quality of the pictures that I take. I often take pictures of myself, my friends and events that I am a part of. A good quality picture can help to preserve good memories. For example, taking pictures at Thanksgiving and Christmas with all the family around the table and the children playing. Looking back at the pictures from these events makes you feel like you‚Äôre back in that very moment you took the picture. One of the features Apple decided to remove was having a jack for the headphones. Instead they replaced the headphone jack with another speaker. That is a upside to not having a plug for the headphones now, because now the phone is louder. However, I can not listen to music in my headphones and charge my phone at the same time which can sometimes be an inconvenience. In comparison to the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 has better and more advanced features. If you are a person who is constantly using their phone and likes to have all the newest techno devices, I would recommend this phone 100%. Overall I believe that the phone has made many well thought out decisions, regardless of the sacrifices that had to be made."

It works great, the battery lasts a lot longer than his iphone7 that just recently crashed, and it was in pristine condition!  What more could you ask for!?! Not to mention, the T-Mobile provider (or whatever sub-brand service of T-Mobile) has great super cheap options for plans!  I was excited when I called to set it up hearing they had a $25 plan with unlimited talk text and 3Gs of data!  I don‚Äôt know ANY service with that cheap of service!!

iPhone 6s	32GB	Silver	Ashley	5	The left side of the sceeen wasn‚Äôt working but Apple replaced the screen which fixed the issue	2019-06-24	"Came exactly as described, except the left side of the screen was messed up. When we tried clicking the ‚ÄúABC/123‚Äùbutton on the keyboard, and the ‚Äú1/Q‚Äù button it wouldn‚Äôt work. We had apps on the second page of the home screen and it wouldn‚Äôt let us drag the apps to the left to move them to the first page. I called Amazon to inform them of the issue and they transferred me to an Apple representative. After having me download the lastest update and resetting the phone, it still wasn‚Äôt working properly. Apple said I could either send the phone to them to be repaired or take it to a local Apple store to be fixed. They scheduled me an appointment that evening with Geek Squad at my local Best Buy, since the closest Apple store was a couple hours away. Geek Squad was very friendly, and replaced the screen on my phone within 2 hours, which fixed the problem of not being able to touch the left side of the screen. It‚Äôs a really nice phone and everything works perfectly now. It didn‚Äôt cost me anything to have the screen replaced, so even though it was an inconvenience to take it to get fixed, I‚Äôm happy they were able to fix it and that it only took a couple hours to get the phone back. I bought this phone for my daughter, because she likes using my iPhone 7, and she absolutely loves this phone. When she is playing Minecraft, the phone loads fast and doesn‚Äôt lag, which is what made us decide to purchase a new phone."

Apple Store offered $300+ examination, especially as the dial pad was now generating error messages. There is no sure remedy, however. N fact, as a knowledgeable tech guy, I found Apple‚Äôs approach and evaluation superficial, definitely NOT confidence-building. The phone still doesn‚Äôt work. A multi-hundred dollar piece of junk. You‚Äôd be nuts to buy this phone and, I suspect, any iPhone. You pay more upfront and you pay more in the longer run.  Unless you get lucky with your Chinese gear.
